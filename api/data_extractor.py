You will be provided with a set of images corresponding to a single product. These images are found printed on the packaging of the product.
Your goal will be to extract information from these images to populate the schema provided. Here is some information you will routinely encounter. Ensure that you capture complete information, especially for nutritional information and ingredients:
- Ingredients: List of ingredients in the item. They may have some percent listed in brackets. They may also have metadata or classification like Preservative (INS 211) where INS 211 forms the metadata. Structure accordingly. If ingredients have subingredients like sugar: added sugar, trans sugar, treat them as different ingredients.
- Claims: Like a mango fruit juice says contains fruit.
- Nutritional Information: This will have nutrients, serving size, and nutrients listed per serving. Extract the base value for reference.
- FSSAI License number: Extract the license number. There might be many, so store relevant ones.
- Name: Extract the name of the product.
- Brand/Manufactured By: Extract the parent company of this product.
- Serving size: This might be explicitly stated or inferred from the nutrients per serving.
