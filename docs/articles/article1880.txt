Title: All You Need to Know About High Protein, Low Carb Diets

A high protein, low carb diet may have several physical and cognitive benefits, but some studies suggest there may be risks. A balanced diet of complex carbs, lean proteins, and healthy fats is optimal.
High protein, low carb diets have become increasingly popular as a means of  encouraging weight loss  while maintaining or increasing muscle mass.
Keep reading to learn more about how this diet works and its possible health benefits and drawbacks.

What is the high protein, low carb diet?
The high protein, low carb diet swaps much of your daily carb intake for protein.
There’s no set  macronutrient  ratio, but people base this eating pattern largely on the allotments of the two diets that inspired it.
Low carb diets  restrict carb intake to less than  26%  of total daily calories. If you follow a 2,000-calorie diet, this means consuming fewer than 130 grams (g) of carbs. Very low carb diets reduce this number to under 10%.
High protein diets  often provide more protein than the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of 0.8 g per kilogram of body weight (g/kg/bw) or 0.36 g per pound of body weight (g/lb/bw).
For instance, some high protein diets boast up to  2 g/kg/bw  (0.9/lb/bw), which is the equivalent of 136 g of protein daily for a 150-lb (68-kg) person. However, there isn’t a standardized definition of “high protein.”
High protein, low carb diets may also be higher in fat to compensate for the carb deficit. For instance, a 2,000-calorie version may contain:
Protein:  34% (170 g)
Carbs:  26% (130 g)
Fat:  40% (89 g)
It’s important to note these ranges may differ based on individual factors like level of physical activity and overall health. A healthcare professional or registered dietitian could help you determine your ideal macronutrient targets.

Types of high protein, low carb diets
Some popular commercial diets are commonly considered high in protein and low in carbs, but they don’t truly fit into both categories.
Notably, many people regard the  Zone Diet  and  Sugar Busters Diet  as high protein and low carb. However, these diets are moderate in carbs, as they typically provide about 40% of calories from carbs.
Low carb, high fat diets like the  Atkins  and  ketogenic  diets may be considered high protein diets because they most likely provide more protein than the RDA.
For instance, the ketogenic diet provides  30% to 35%  of calories from protein, or around 1 g/lb/bw (2.2/kg/bw).
A  2014 review  estimated the average protein intake in the Atkins diet is around 2.3 g/kg/bw (1.1 g/lb/bw).
One way to eat a high protein, low carb diet is by counting calories and staying within your  target macronutrient ratio . This may be difficult, so consider replacing high carb foods with  high protein sources  to adjust your ratio.

Health benefits of high protein, low carb diets
High protein, low carb diets may provide numerous physical and cognitive health benefits.
Research suggests that higher protein consumption may play several key roles in promoting weight loss,  such as :
increasing feelings of fullness
reducing hunger and cravings
lowering levels of hunger hormones, such as ghrelin
increasing levels of fullness hormones, such as glucagon, cholecystokinin, and peptide YY
boosting  basal metabolic rate
increasing the thermic effect of food (calories burned during digestion)

Eating a high protein, low carb diet may also help improve body composition.
When you lose weight, you can expect to experience  decreases  in lean muscle mass.
However, research shows that increasing protein intake while cutting  500 to 750 calories  daily can maintain muscle mass while promoting fat loss. High protein diets may help  increase muscle mass  when combined with resistance training.
However, this effect is lost during  more severe  calorie restrictions, such as during unplanned, very low calorie diets.
High protein, low carb diets may also have several other health benefits, including:
regulating  blood sugar, which is especially important if you have diabetes
reducing  bone loss and fracture risk in older adults
reducing  the risk of cognitive decline
A  small study  also suggests that a high protein, low carb diet may help improve cardiometabolic factors, such as lowering blood pressure, cholesterol, and  triglyceride  levels.
However, research on the benefits of this diet for heart health is mixed.
A  2023 review  found that high protein, low carb diets had no significant effects on metabolic factors or the risk of  stroke and heart attack .
If you have  high blood pressure  or a condition that may increase your risk of developing heart-related complications, consider speaking with a healthcare professional. They could help develop an exercise and dietary plan for you.

Potential downsides
Some research associates high protein, low carb diets with an increased risk of heart disease and heart failure.
For instance, a  2018 study  involving 2,441 men ages 42 to 60 years found that participants with the highest total protein intake had a 33% increased risk of  heart failure  than those with the lowest intake.
Participants who ate the most animal protein also had a 43% greater risk of developing heart failure than those who ate the least animal protein.
However, participants with the overall highest protein intake were more likely to have overweight or  diabetes , both of which are  risk factors  for heart failure.
Experts widely consider high protein diets  to be safe  for people with normal kidney function, though those with  kidney disease  may need to avoid this eating pattern.
Very low carb diets are also tied to negative effects, including a potentially increased risk of death from all causes. It’s important to note, however, that this mostly depends on the quality of the carbs being eaten.
More high quality, long-term research on the downsides of both low carb and high protein diets is needed.
Your daily protein needs will depend on many factors, such as your sex assigned at birth, age, activity levels, and body composition goals, among others.
A high protein diet of up to  2 g/kg/bw  (0.9/lb/bw) may be beneficial if you’re very physically active or looking to lose weight while maintaining muscle mass.
However, most people who have a moderately active lifestyle don’t need to consume this much protein. For most physically active people, a daily protein intake of  1.2 to 2 g/kg/bw  (0.54 to 0.9 g/lb/bw) is likely optimal.
Moreover, high protein, low carb diets aren’t necessary to promote overall health.
There are several things that are more important to your well-being than your macronutrient ratios, such as:
eating a balanced, nutrient-rich diet
staying within your calorie needs
exercising  regularly
reducing your intake of processed foods and added sugar

Foods to limit
When following a high protein, low carb diet, it’s important to reduce your intake of  carb-rich foods . Consider limiting the following:
Grains and starches:  breads, rice, pasta, baked goods, cereals, etc
Sweeteners:  sugar, agave, maple syrup, honey, coconut sugar, etc
Sugary drinks:  juice, sweetened coffee and tea, soda, sports drinks, sweetened alcohol beverages, beer, etc

It’s important to remember that you could include  complex carbs  like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables in moderation.
Your total carb intake will depend on your desired macronutrient ranges.

Foods to eat
Eating mostly whole, nutrient-rich foods is best on a high protein, low carb diet — as with any balanced diet. You’ll generally want to increase your protein intake.
Foods you may choose to eat on this diet include:
Animal protein:  eggs, chicken, bison, turkey, beef, lamb, pork
Plant-based protein:  tofu,  edamame , and other soy foods
Fish and shellfish:  cod, flounder, clams, shrimp, etc

Frequently asked questions
The most important factor in weight loss is maintaining a  calorie deficit , which is when you burn more calories than you consume. A high protein, low carb diet may help you lose weight if you maintain a calorie deficit. However, you can also gain weight on this diet if you consume more calories than you burn.
Some of the cheaper high protein, low carb foods available include eggs, canned foods like fish, beans, and lentils, cottage cheese, Greek yogurt, tofu, and ground meats like chicken, beef, and pork. Consider opting for “own brand” products instead of brand names, as these are usually more affordable.
Consuming 0 g of carbs is an extreme diet that would require exclusively eating meat and pure fat, like oils. Research on how these diets impact health is limited, but generally, diets high in animal-based foods have been  linked  with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.

The bottom line
The high protein, low carb diet has no set definition but may be best for people who want to promote  weight loss  while preserving or increasing muscle mass.
Although this eating pattern may have other benefits, some research links it to downsides. People with impaired kidney function may need to avoid this diet.
If you’re looking to optimize your overall health, focus on eating whole, nutrient-dense foods, limiting your intake of added sugar and processed foods, getting plenty of exercise, and  decreasing your stress levels .
