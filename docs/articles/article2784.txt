Protein bars are a popular snack and can be a simple and tasty way to squeeze more protein into your daily diet. However, not all protein bars are created equal.
Many varieties of protein bars are loaded with added sugar, artificial sweeteners, and other additives, which may negate many of the potential health benefits they have to offer.
Healthline contributor and registered dietitian Kelli McGrane put 28 protein bar brands to the test to see which ones are worth your money.

Healthline’s picks of the best protein bars

Best overall
Protein type   egg
Taste   rich dark chocolate flavor with a hint of salt; not overly sweet
Texture   very chewy with a bit of texture from pieces of nuts and chocolate
Price   $$
RXBAR Chocolate Sea Salt is my pick for the best overall because it checks every box: high in fiber, more than 10 grams (g) of protein, free of added sugar, and made with whole food ingredients.
It’s also free of palm oil, an ingredient that some people  may prefer  to avoid due to its high saturated fat content and the environmental concerns  associated  with its production.
Featuring gooey chocolate chips, a rich dark chocolate base, and a sprinkle of  sea salt  on top, this chewy bar is a true chocolate lover’s dream. While I find some RXBARs to be too chewy and borderline dry, this flavor is a bit softer and, in my opinion, more enjoyable.
RXBAR offers 11 other regular flavors plus a few seasonal varieties, so there’s sure to be a bar to suit your taste buds.

Protein type   rice, egg, milk, and peanut
Taste   rich peanut butter flavor with dark chocolate
Texture   smooth, melt-in-your-mouth texture with crispy bits
Price   $$$
Perfect Snacks Crisp bars offer the creamy texture of the brand’s flagship Perfect Bar but with the addition of crispy quinoa for a satisfying crunch.
As with all Perfect Snacks bars, Crisp bars are made from recognizable ingredients such as peanut butter, honey, toasted oats, and date paste. The bars also contain a Whole Foods Powder blend, which includes nutrient powerhouses such as kale, spinach, and  flaxseed .
I’ve long been a fan of Perfect Bars because of their ingredients. However, I can typically stomach only half a bar because of how thick and rich they are.
While Crisp bars are still just as rich and sweet, I found that their thinner size and bits of crunch made them more enjoyable to eat — in fact, they’ve become a staple in my fridge.
Perfect Bar Crisp bars are free of preservatives and artificial additives, so they stay fresh at room temperature for only up to 7 days. For longer storage, you’ll need to keep them in your fridge.

Best vegan
Protein type   brown rice
Taste   sweet cookie dough flavor without any artificial aftertaste
Texture   chewy but not dense; not at all powdery or chalky
Price   $$
If you’re looking for a way to boost your protein intake while following a  plant-based diet , Aloha protein bars are worth considering. Available in multiple flavors, the bars are all certified vegan and made with organic ingredients.
What’s more, Aloha bars are free of artificial additives, gluten, stevia, dairy, palm oil, and soy. And it doesn’t hurt that they’re pretty tasty.
The Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough was my favorite during testing, though the Lemon Cashew came in a close second. In particular, I loved the chewy texture and spot-on cookie dough flavor. Keep in mind that many of the other flavors feature a chocolate coating and have a slightly different texture.
It’s also worth noting that I’ve purchased these bars in bulk online and several times have received bars that were a bit hard, as if they had been stored for awhile. While it is more expensive, I prefer to purchase individual Aloha bars directly from the grocery store.

Best soft
Protein type   brown rice
Taste   very much like a not-too-sweet peanut butter cup; no artificial aftertaste
Texture   soft, smooth, and melts in your mouth
Price   $$
If you dislike traditional protein bars, which often have a dense, powdery texture, then you’ll want to check out TRUBAR — though you’ll also need to like your bars dessert-level sweet.
A product of TRUWOMEN (a woman-founded and -owned business), TRUBARS are made with just a handful of 100% plant-based ingredients and come in six dessert-inspired flavors.
The Smother Fudger Peanut Butter bar features a rich chocolate coating and a sweet peanut butter middle that melts in your mouth. The texture is definitely on the softer side, which I liked, but it may not be ideal if you prefer a bar with more chew.
It’s also worth noting that these bars are very sweet. While that might be a plus for some, I find that because of the sweetness, I don’t like eating them multiple days in a row.
Compared with those of other bars we tested, the price of these varied quite a bit. Purchasing directly from  the company’s website  was the most cost-effective option. However, Costco members can buy them in bulk for optimal cost savings.

Best crunchy
Protein type   soy
Taste   nutty with a rich chocolate flavor
Texture   hard and crunchy
Price   $
While protein bars are notoriously dense and a little chalky, the KIND Dark Chocolate Nut Protein Bar is the exact opposite. Featuring crunchy whole nuts and a drizzle of chocolate, this bar will definitely put your jaw to work.
This is the only bar on the list that I wasn’t able to try. However, this bar and flavor, in particular, was highly recommended by Healthline writer Rachael Ajmera, MS, RD.
It features nutrient-dense ingredients, and she noted that it’s her go-to afternoon pick-me-up thanks to its rich chocolaty flavor.
Like most other KIND snack bars, the Dark Chocolate Nut bar is made from mostly whole food ingredients. It’s also low in added sugar, high in fiber, and rich in  healthy fats .

Best low FODMAP
Protein type   plant-based blend
Taste   subtle chocolate and sunflower butter flavors; not overly sweet
Texture   chewy with bits of puffed brown rice for texture
Price   $$$
If you follow a  low FODMAP diet , then you know how difficult it can be to find suitable packaged snacks. Enter GoMacro.
GoMacro offers several low FODMAP-friendly products, including the Sunflower Butter + Chocolate bar. This flavor is also nut-free, non-GMO verified, and certified vegan, organic, and gluten-free.
I liked the bar’s pleasantly chewy texture and not-too-sweet flavor. It was also one of the most filling bars I tried — in fact, I had a hard time finishing a whole bar.
The GoMacro Sunflower Butter + Chocolate bar is a bit higher in calories and carbs than many of the other products on our list, so it’s a good option for throwing in your hiking bag or bringing on your  next ride .

Best for weight loss
Protein type   plant-based blend
Taste   sweet peanut butter flavor with a noticeable alternative sweetener aftertaste
Texture   chewy and chalky, with some texture from peanut pieces
Price   $$$
If you’re trying to  shed a few pounds , choosing a protein bar that’s relatively low in calories but high in fiber and protein  may help  you  reach your goal .
Providing 17 g of fiber, 21 g of protein, 0 g of added sugar, and fewer than 200 calories, the No Cow Chunky Peanut Butter bar is a good option if you’re watching your weight.
To keep the bars free of added sugar, No Cow uses several sugar alternatives, including stevia,  monk fruit , and sugar alcohols, all of which impart a noticeable aftertaste.
However, during testing, I found the aftertaste to be less pronounced in the Chunky Peanut Butter flavor. Similarly, while the bars are a bit chalky, the peanut pieces in this flavor add a nice boost of texture.

Best for muscle building
Protein type   soy
Taste   rich chocolate flavor
Texture   very dense but relatively smooth; can get a little dry
Price   $$
Whether you’re trying to build muscle or frequently spending your days out on the trail, PROBAR protein bars are a great option. In addition to being high in protein, they provide a good amount of carbs, which  are key  for supporting  muscle gains .
While all PROBAR protein bars are pretty dense, the Chocolate Brownie was my favorite, as it has a smooth consistency that isn’t too dry. It also has a rich chocolate flavor that’s likely to satisfy any  chocolate craving .
PROBAR Chocolate Brownie is certified gluten-free, non-GMO verified, and vegan-friendly.

Best low carb
Protein type   whey
Taste   rich milk chocolate and peanut butter flavor
Texture   very soft, melt-in-your mouth consistency; a bit chalky
Price   $$
If you’re following a low carb diet, there’s no shortage of options (especially  keto-friendly protein bars ) to choose from. And while each bar I tried had its pros and cons, this one, by far, had the best flavor.
Of the keto-friendly bars I tried, the think! Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie Delight Protein Bar was the only one that didn’t have an unpleasant, lingering aftertaste.
Instead, the bar reminded me of a Reese’s Fast Break candy bar, with a rich peanut butter center, a milk chocolate coating, and a soft, slightly chalky, melt-in-your-mouth texture.

How we tested protein bars
Nutritional content:  I looked for bars with at least 10 g of protein, 3 g of fiber, and 12 g or less of added sugar per serving. Because calorie needs vary, I included bars with 180 to 270 calories.
Ingredients:  I paid close attention to ingredient lists, prioritizing bars with minimal amounts of artificial additives such as flavorings, sweeteners, and preservatives.
Availability:  All the bars below are available throughout the United States and can regularly be found in at least one nationwide grocery store.
Taste test:  During the initial round of testing, I tried multiple flavors from 25 brands over the course of 2 weeks. During testing, I considered whether the overall taste and texture made a bar satisfying to eat. I also noted whether the bar kept me full for more than an hour. I’ve since tried three additional brands and came away with a new favorite (hint: it requires refrigeration).
Price:  I included products to suit a range of budgets.
All brands and products below were also thoroughly vetted to ensure that they align with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being. You can read more about  our vetting process .
