Thorne wins our vote for the best vitamin brand for its research-backed formulations, high quality ingredients, and commitment to quality.

Thorne’s products often top Healthline’s best-of lists. For example, Thorne Women’s Multi 50+ was named the  best multivitamin for women  over 50.
Thorne vitamin and supplement products are widely available and can be purchased online or at major retailers.

Rita Mauceri, Healthline senior director of commerce, tried Thorne Women’s Multi 50+.
When asked about the brand, Mauceri shared, “I have encountered Thorne products before and like their science-based approach. The brand is detailed, cautious, and credible in their knowledge of supplements (including some I have never heard of) and their approach to creating products to support health at different ages and stages of life.”
As for the supplement itself, Mauceri didn’t love the serving size of six capsules. However, serving size aside, “I felt good in the 30 days that I took these multivitamins. My energy, mood, and focus were strong and even. My sleep and digestion were also better than normal,” she said.

Healthline team member Corin Groustra tested Thorne Basic Prenatal while nursing after the birth of her second child. Unlike other brands she’s tried, Groustra said that Thorne didn’t cause her any side effects. “I feel like I finally found one that doesn’t feel like a chore to take, and I don’t have to think too much about,” she said.

Ritual is our pick for best multivitamin brand because of its traceable ingredients and use of third-party testing to confirm label accuracy.
Ritual’s multivitamins are formulated to meet nutrient needs based on age and sex. Also, its multivitamins for men, women, and teens feature delayed-release capsules, which are designed to dissolve in your small intestine rather than your stomach to  enhance  absorption.
Just keep in mind that they’re formulated to help bridge common nutrient gaps from your diet and may not be appropriate for people in need of a more comprehensive multivitamin.
Because Ritual is a subscription-based service, it can be a convenient option if you prefer having your supplements delivered directly to your door each month. However, Ritual products are available in select stores in case you’d rather try them before committing to a monthly subscription.

Kelli McGrane, a registered dietitian and Healthline freelancer, shared her thoughts after testing a multivitamin from Ritual: “I was overall impressed by Ritual Essential for Women Multivitamin 18+. The pills were easy to swallow and, because I don’t eat much fish, I appreciated having a multivitamin that contains  omega-3 DHA .”
The Ritual Essential for Women Multivitamin 50+ has a slightly different formulation and was tested by Mauceri. She said she was surprised by how much she liked the brand, commenting, “I was not at all prepared for the alluring peppermint scent that wafted from the bottle when I opened it.
“I immediately went on the Ritual website to find out what the deal was, and found out the source is their Minty Tab, a food-grade plastic insert infused with essential oil. It may sound like a small thing, but honestly it made the experience of taking my daily capsule so much more appealing.”

Another editor on the commerce team, Catherine Conelly, said she took the company’s prenatal vitamin throughout her first pregnancy.
“I found Ritual’s Essential for Women Prenatal to be a great prenatal option, and I appreciated the convenience of the subscription model.”
She also commented on the scent, noting “while [at the time] it was marketed as having a lemon essence, I found the taste and smell to be quite neutral and not overpowering.”

Knowing which supplements to choose can be confusing, which is why we appreciate that HUM subscribers are paired with a registered dietitian for personalized advice.
HUM also stands out for its high quality ingredients and use of third-party testing to ensure purity and potency.
The company offers a wide range of products with a focus on supplements designed to support hair, skin, mood, and women’s health.

Read our full review of  HUM supplements .

Healthline editor Christy Snyder tried HUM Private Party for 1 month.
Snyder said, “I’ve tried a few products from this brand. They have been great with shipping. I like that they are non-GMO certified, part of the  Clean Label Project , and devoted to avoiding putting more plastic in our oceans.” She also noted that the capsules were well tolerated and easy to swallow.
Another Healthline editor, Kristin Currin-Sheehan, tried HUM OMG! Omega The Great with the goal of helping with joint pain and brain fog from fibromyalgia. While she said there was a fishy smell upon opening the bottle, the capsules didn’t have an aftertaste or yield the “fishy burps” that fish oil supplements are famous for.

If you’re looking for a reliable vitamin brand that’s budget-friendly and widely available, we recommend Nature Made.
Nature Made offers a wide range of dietary supplements that are often more affordable than its competitors, including:
multivitamins
letter vitamins
minerals
herbs
prenatal vitamins
omega-3 supplements
specialty supplement formulations
Despite a lower price tag, most Nature Made products are third-party verified by  US Pharmacopeia (USP)  to ensure quality and label accuracy.
Nature Made supplements frequently appear on Healthline’s best-of lists, including our list of  best multivitamins for men .




Healthline senior editor Chelsea Logan took Nature Made’s  iron supplement  for many years before ultimately switching to a vegan brand.
When asked about why she likes Nature Made, Logan said, “I like that it’s USP verified. I don’t like having to buy everything online, or having to sign up for a bunch of subscriptions, so I like that I can just pick this up at Target when I’m out running errands.”
Logan noted that she has a history of anemia and has taken daily iron supplements since she was a teen. “The Nature Made supplements didn’t cause me any GI issues, and the pills are small and easy to swallow. They don’t have any metallic taste or smell. The only reason I switched to another brand is because these aren’t vegan, but for non-vegans I’d definitely recommend them.”

Other Healthline reviewers have tested Nature Made Multi for Her and Multi for Him.
Former Healthline editor Kelle Walsh, who tested the women’s multi, said, “It’s definitely a good value. This costs half as much as my usual multivitamin.”
Still, she noted that it didn’t have as much calcium as she’d hoped.
Another Healthline team member, Carson Pledger, who tested the men’s multi, also commented on the great value, calculating the price to be around 12 cents per vitamin. “ It is the same price or cheaper than a lot of other vitamins I have researched and still has a good concentration of a lot of the key vitamins I was looking for,” he said.

Garden of Life is a supplement company that’s committed to creating high quality supplements using whole food ingredients, many of which are certified organic by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). In fact, the company offers more than 100 USDA certified organic products.
In addition to being certified organic, many Garden of Life products are also certified gluten-free and vegan.
As a company,  Garden of Life Organics  wins our respect for its quality, transparency, and sustainability. In addition to being certified carbon-neutral, for example, all Garden of Life Organics products undergo third-party testing for purity and potency. However, the name of the testing organization isn’t disclosed.
We also like that you can easily find Garden of Life supplements online, at your local pharmacy or grocery store, and at large chains, like Walmart and Target.
Healthline manager Sydney Samuels shared her experience with Garden of Life Organics, saying, “My doctor found that I was deficient in vitamin B12 and recommended that I start taking  vitamin B12 supplements  regularly.
“I considered several options and ultimately decided on Garden of Life’s Vitamin Code B12 based on positive online reviews, price point, and convenience of ordering a subscription through Amazon.
“Because I’m vegetarian, I also liked that these pills are vegan-friendly.
“I’ve been taking my Garden of Life supplements for nearly 6 months. They’re not the smallest pills, but they’re not too big either. They also provide the exact dose that my doctor recommended, which means I only have to take one pill per day, and they don’t have any flavor or aftertaste.”

Our other tester, Jacob Moore, associate director, tried the men’s multivitamin and noted that the supplement was “incredibly easy to take” and that it gave him peace of mind knowing his nutritional bases were covered.

Although  Nordic Naturals  produces a variety of vitamins and mineral supplements, the company is perhaps best known for its high quality, absorbable  omega-3 supplements  tailored to fit a range of nutritional needs.

In fact, Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega earns Healthline’s pick for the best overall  fish oil supplement .
In addition to fish oil, Nordic Naturals offers  vegan-friendly options  sourced from algae, along with omega-3 supplements tailored to various health concerns and products specifically for:
children
infants
athletes
pregnant people
We appreciate the company’s dedication to quality and transparency. In addition to having all products tested by an independent lab, the company provides a  COA  for each supplement, which includes information on testing results.
To help maximize the  potential benefits , all Nordic Naturals fish oil supplements are available in triglyceride form, which your body can absorb  more effectively  than ethyl ester forms of fish oil.


Nordic Naturals is a go-to brand for Healthline editor Crystal Hoshaw.
According to Hoshaw, “I love Nordic Naturals. It’s my go-to pick for fish oil and omega complex products. I trust it more than any brand on the market to be tested for mercury and provide high quality, potent, absorbable nutrients.
“My son never has trouble taking the Children’s DHA Chewable Softgels, and when he gets bored of one flavor, we switch to another for a while to change things up. My sister is vegan, and she uses the Algea Omega product.
“I especially like the company’s Ultimate Omega + C0Q10. Because C0Q10 can be expensive to buy as an additional supplement, I appreciate that I can easily take one pill and be done!”

Logan has also sampled a couple of supplements from Nordic Naturals, including the brand’s Algae Omega. She noted that because she’s vegan, she can’t take fish oil, but she still wants to ensure she’s getting adequate omega-3s in her diet.
“The capsules are small and easy to swallow,” she said. “I’ve tried an algae omega-3s from Future Kind and Nature Made, too, and these have the highest amount of EPA and DHA.”

Founded by dietitian and fertility nutrition expert Ayla Barmmer, FullWell offers high quality, comprehensive formulations to provide support before, during, and after pregnancy.
It wins our vote, in particular, for its signature Women’s Prenatal Multivitamin. This product provides many nutrients essential for promoting a healthy pregnancy,  including  folate, vitamin D, and vitamin B12.
It also contains  choline , which is essential for your baby’s brain development and isn’t found in all  prenatal supplements . Other ingredients, such as magnesium and calcium, are chelated, or bound to amino acid, to  help increase  absorption.
To support your pre- or postnatal needs, the company also offers a fish oil supplement that provides essential omega-3 fatty acids.

FullWell products are manufactured in a  UL Solutions certified facility  and batch tested to ensure purity and potency. A certificate of analysis (COA) is available upon request.

Conelly switched from Ritual to FullWell after giving birth to her son. Conelly shared, “I subscribed to the prenatal and fish oil bundle, which I’ve been taking while breastfeeding. At first, I was worried about taking eight capsules per day. However, it has not caused me any discomfort.
“Also, compared to others I’ve taken, the fish oil has not left me with any fishy burp side effects.”

All of Klean Athlete’s products are formulated specifically for athletes and are  NSF Certified for Sport . This third-party certification ensures supplements are free from substances banned by most competitive sport organizations.
In addition to multivitamins and omega-3 fatty acids, the company has a wide selection of supplements designed to optimize athletic performance, such as:
creatine
whey protein
collagen
branched-chain amino acids
Klean Creatine, one of the brand’s most popular products, made Healthline’s list of  best creatine supplements . This product is formulated with creatine monohydrate, the form of creatine that has been  studied most extensively  and is considered the best choice for supplementation.
Other supplements from Klean Athlete are also made using highly absorbable ingredients. For example, the brand’s Klean Isolate features  whey protein , a type of protein powder that’s  more readily absorbed  than plant-based sources of protein, such as pea protein.
Read our full review of Klean Athlete.

McGrane tested seven creatine brands and found Klean Athlete to be the best, commenting that it had no taste or aftertaste. She added, “[It] was one of the easiest to scoop and mix.”

Another Healthline team member, JaTory Reid, tried Klean Athlete BCAA + Peak ATP with the goal of enhancing his daily workouts at the gym. He appreciates that it was a caffeine-free alternative to other pre-workout supplements.
After taking the supplement for 3 days, he said, “ I noticed a real difference in my energy levels and the amount of time before my muscles started to become fatigued. My workouts would stretch to 45 [minutes or longer] before I felt any decline in physical strength.”
However, he noted the biggest difference during cardio after 1 week of consistent use. “ My lung capacity and legs have never felt stronger. During my first run on day 7, I kept my same 4-mile pace but felt noticeably less fatigued at the end of the run.”

Best for gummy vitamins
Price range   $16 to $40

Offering brightly colored multivitamin gummies for the whole family, SmartyPants is a well-known brand of  gummy vitamins .
In addition to being easy to find and relatively affordable, we like that the company’s products are third-party tested by  NSF International  to ensure purity and potency.
The multivitamins also stand out for their inclusion of omega-3 fatty acids, which aren’t often included in competitor products.
The biggest downside is the dosage recommendations, with some products recommending up to six gummies per day. Additionally, unless you opt for the company’s line of no added sugar products, some supplements contain up to 6 grams of added sugar per serving.
Healthline freelancer and registered dietitian Kelli McGrane, Healthline analyst Shelby Stanley, and Healthline director Nick Trull all enjoyed taking supplements from SmartyPants.
According to Trull, “I enjoyed taking the SmartyPants Men’s Formula Multivitamin. It was tasty and easy to consume. It was a fun treat to kick off the day. The downside is the recommendation of six gummies a day.”

Stanley, who tested the Women’s Multi, added, “ I liked the texture of the gummies, especially how they were not sticky to the touch but were also not difficult to chew!”
She commented that although she’s usually not a fan of Orange Creme flavor, the flavor grew on her and the gummies weren’t too sweet.
“ I think the quality of this product is amazing for the price! I’m often wary of whether opting for affordability compromises the quality, but this is a supplement that meets both standards,” she added.
Finally, McGrane shared that she took the company’s prenatal gummies during both of her pregnancies. “While it wasn’t my primary prenatal, I always kept a bottle around because it was the only supplement I could stomach on days when I was feeling extra nauseous.
“Also, because I rarely eat fish, I appreciated having a prenatal gummy that provided both  EPA and DHA  omega-3s. The lack of a fishy aftertaste was also a plus.”

“Also, because I rarely eat fish, I appreciated having a prenatal gummy that provided both  EPA and DHA  omega-3s. The lack of a fishy aftertaste was also a plus.”

Founded in 2019 by certified plant-based nutritionists, Future Kind specializes in fully vegan and cruelty-free supplements.
As part of the company’s commitment to animal welfare and the environment, the company donates a portion of sales to animal sanctuaries and all packaging materials are made from recycled content or glass.
Future Kind offers a wide selection of products, from multivitamins and iron supplements to protein powders and omega-3s, all of which are approved by registered dietitians and third-party tested to ensure purity and potency.
We also like that products are specifically formulated to provide nutrients that are  commonly lacking in vegan diets , such as higher amounts of vitamin B12 and algae-based DHA and EPA omega-3 fatty acids.
Logan currently takes Future Kind Vegan Iron + Vitamin C, which she said has been working for her chronic iron deficiency.
“After switching from Nature Made to Future Kind, I didn’t see any changes in my labs, so this seems to be just as effective for me. Although it’s more expensive, I think it’s worth the cost. I also like that it comes in a glass bottle instead of plastic to cut down on waste.”
She also added that she appreciates the addition of vitamin C in the capsules. “My doctor always advises me to take vitamin C with my iron supplements, since vitamin C can help you absorb iron. These supplements make that easy since they contain vitamin C.”

Samuels, who follows a vegetarian diet, has tried the Essential Vegan Multivitamin. “ Compared to other supplements I’ve taken, this one had a pleasant taste (without any aftertaste), was relatively easy to swallow, and most importantly, packaged several of the nutrients I need all in one multivitamin,” she said.

Ora Organic is one of the best brands for powder-based supplements, thanks to the company’s rigorous testing standards and commitment to sourcing high quality, research-backed ingredients.
In addition to their signature So Lean & So Clean plant-based protein powder, Ora also offers plant-based collagen, pre-workout,  greens powders . There’s even a powdered probiotic supplement for people who dislike swallowing pills.
Ora Organic supplements are plant-based, USDA certified organic, and free from fillers, gums, and artificial ingredients.
It’s also worth noting that the company recently updated its So Lean & So Clean protein powder to be creamier and free from stevia, a natural sweetener that some people dislike the aftertaste of.
All Ora Organic products undergo rigorous quality testing by third-party labs with COAs publicly available on Ora’s website.
McGrane said Ora Organic Easy Being Green Superfood Greens Powder is easy to mix into liquid, though the texture is gritty. She described the taste as “earthy,” which wasn’t a deal breaker for her but could be for some.
Still, she said, “It’s one of the more affordable options and boasts high quality ingredients, so it might be worth the taste trade-off if you’re OK with mixing this powder into a smoothie or other flavored beverage.”
McGrane also sampled Ora Organic Lady Bugs and says she’d recommend it. “I love that it’s third-party tested, contains research backed strains, and the bottle is nice-looking so you won’t mind having it out on your counter,” she said.

Additional brands to consider
In addition to the brands listed above, there are several other companies to keep on your radar, especially if you have specific product or dietary needs. Here are several that just narrowly missed our list:
Pure Encapsulations:  Compared with other brands,  Pure Encapsulations  offers a wider selection of supplements that are certified gluten-free and free of many common allergens. The company also adheres to strict safety procedures to prevent cross-contamination for any allergens, and each supplement undergoes rigorous third-party testing for contaminants and harmful compounds.
Culturelle:  A good option if you’re looking for a probiotic supplement, Culturelle offers a wide variety of products. All of them feature research-backed probiotic strains and are relatively affordable and easy to find.
NOW Foods:  Similar to Nature Made,  NOW Foods supplements  are generally affordable and widely available. They’re also extensively tested in third-party certified manufacturing facilities.
Mindbodygreen:  A relative newcomer to the supplement market,  mindbodygreen supplements  stand out for their ingredient quality, thoughtful formulations, and third-party testing. The biggest drawbacks are the price and availability, as products are only available through mindbodygreen’s website.
Vital Proteins:  This well-known  collagen supplement brand  is widely available in stores and online. We like that Vital Proteins offers collagen supplements in multiple forms, including capsules, powders, and gummies. While its supplements are third-party tested for purity, Vital protein products are not independently tested to confirm potency.

A comparison of the best vitamin brands

How we chose the best vitamin brands
The vitamin brands on our list have been  vetted  to ensure they align with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being.
Products that passed our vetting process were then reviewed by editors and registered dietitians. To determine the best vitamin brands, we considered the following factors:
Quality testing:  We prioritized brands with products that have undergone testing to ensure purity and potency, ideally by an independent lab.
Certifications:  We looked for brands that offer products with additional certifications from third-party organizations.
Ingredients:  We chose brands that prioritize the use of high quality ingredients and easily absorbed forms of vitamins and minerals. Most also avoid or limit the use of  artificial flavors, fillers, and preservatives .
Brand reputation:  We selected brands with mostly positive reputations and that are well regarded by our nutrition experts.
Hands-on testing:  Most of the brands on our list are ones that Healthline editors and writers have tried and recommend.
Price:  While the products may vary in price, each brand offers supplements that provide a good value.
Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the brands on this page, we considered all the vitamin brands that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further.

How to choose a vitamin brand
Personal needs:  Consider your health goals and look for a brand that offers products catered to your needs. For example, some brands provide products specifically for athletes, while others focus on meeting the needs of children, teens, or pregnant people.
Brand reputation:  Choose a product from a well-established, reputable brand that’s compliant with the  current good manufacturing practices  established by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Testing:  Look for products that are tested to ensure purity and potency, ideally by a third-party organization.
Ingredients label:  Be sure to check the  ingredients label  and avoid supplements that contain large amounts of fillers, additives, and preservatives.
Dietary restrictions or food allergies:  Many products are certified vegan, gluten-free, or kosher, which may be a key consideration for some.
