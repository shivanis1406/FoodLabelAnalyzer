Title: The 11 Best Vitamin E Oils

Vitamin E is a group of fat-soluble compounds, eight forms of which are naturally occurring.
Alpha-tocopherol is the most common form in your body, where it functions as an antioxidant and supports immune function, cellular signaling, and other bodily processes ( 1 ,  2 ).
It’s concentrated in fatty foods and can be taken as a dietary supplement.
Vitamin E is also a popular ingredient in skin and hair products. While it’s said to treat scars, boost hair health, and minimize the appearance of stretch marks, there’s limited evidence to support these uses ( 3 ).
Nonetheless, many people swear by topical vitamin E, and anecdotal evidence suggests that it may help treat some skin and hair issues. Plus, products commonly use ingredients that may work synergistically with this vitamin to boost skin and hair health.

Considerations for choosing a vitamin E oil
While many people use vitamin E oil in their skin care and hair routines, there’s currently a lack of scientific evidence to support its effectiveness for boosting skin and hair health, reducing scar appearance, and treating stretch marks.
However, anecdotal evidence suggests that it may be effective for these and other uses.
Although vitamin E oil is considered to be relatively safe, using topical vitamin E oil may result in adverse side effects, including rashes and itching, in some people ( 4 ).
Keep in mind that oral vitamin E supplements are often unnecessary and can interact with common medications like blood thinners. For this reason, it’s important to speak to a healthcare professional before taking supplements ( 2 ).
When shopping for vitamin E oil, try to purchase products from reputable brands that contain safe ingredients.
Some ingestible products carry a seal from third-party certification bodies, which test and confirm the ingredients in the product and claimed amounts. Some examples to look for include Underwriters Laboratories (UL), NSF International, and ConsumerLab. Topicals don’t yet carry these certifications, so checking the ingredient list is your best bet.
When you’re reading ingredient lists, choose vitamin E oils that contain alpha-tocopherols and a carrier oil, like extra virgin olive oil. The shorter the ingredient list the better, as some vitamin E oils may contain unnecessary extra ingredients and additives that take away from the purity of the product.
Choose high quality topical vitamin E oil products with minimal ingredients, and ones that carry a third-party testing seal for ingredient and amount verification whenever possible. Remember that oral vitamin E supplements are usually unnecessary.

Many people swear by vitamin E oil for reducing the appearance of scars. Although vitamin E oil is a popular scar treatment, study results are mixed.
For example, a review of six studies found that only half of the studies reported a beneficial effect of vitamin E on the appearance of scars, concluding that insufficient evidence is available to support the widespread use of topical vitamin E alone for scar treatment ( 4 ).
What’s more, vitamin E may be more beneficial for treating scars when used in combination with ingredients like silicone or hydrocortisone ( 4 ).
Even so, many people claim that vitamin E helps reduce the appearance of scars. Here are some vitamin E products that may help with scar treatment.

Although limited evidence supports the benefits of topical vitamin E, some findings suggest that oral  vitamin E supplements  aid specific populations.
For example, human studies note that vitamin E supplements may help treat conditions associated with diabetes and heart disease risk factors, such as helping reduce high LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglyceride levels ( 20 ).
However, deficiency in vitamin E is rare, and  many foods  are rich in this nutrient. Plus, some studies suggest that supplementing long term with this vitamin may lead to adverse health outcomes, such as an increased risk of certain cancers ( 21 ,  22 ).
On a positive note, if you choose to use a vitamin E supplement versus a topical treatment, you’re more likely to find a product that bears a reputable third-party testing seal for quality, purity, and safety, as these are less common among personal care products.
If you’re thinking about taking vitamin E supplements, speak with a healthcare professional first to ensure appropriate dosage and safety.

Who it’s best for:  those who may be seeking a short-term, temporary high dose oral vitamin E supplement instead of a topical one
Form:  edible oil (liquid)
NOW Foods E-Oil contains extra virgin olive oil and vitamin E in the form of alpha-tocopherol.
The company is certified by Underwriters Laboratory, an independent safety organization that tests products to ensure they meet strict purity and quality standards.
Keep in mind that the suggested dose of Now Foods E-Oil contains 170 mg of vitamin E, which is 1,133% of the recommended intake for adults ( 2 ).
The tolerable upper limit (UL) for vitamin E is 1,000 mg per day for adults ages 19 years and older. Because vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, it accumulates and is stored in tissues versus being excreted regularly like the water-soluble B and C vitamins are. It’s best not to exceed the UL for a prolonged period as this increases the risk for negative health effects ( 2 ).

contains only two ingredients, olive oil and alpha-tocopherol

oral vitamin E supplements are not necessary for most healthy people

Comparing vitamin E oils

Frequently asked questions
The most effective form of vitamin E to use is alpha-tocopherol. This is also the only form recognized to meet human requirements for the nutrient ( 2 ).
The best way to tell whether a vitamin E oil is pure is to first look at the ingredient list, which should be minimal. Ideally, it should only contain alpha-tocopherol and an oil, like extra virgin olive oil. Additionally, look for vitamin E oils that bear a third-party certification seal whenever possible, such as UL, NSF International, or ConsumerLab, as this verifies that the product contains what it says it does and in the claimed amounts.
Yes, you can apply vitamin E oil to your face. The best time to do this is after you’ve washed your face and before you go to sleep so it has time to fully soak into your skin. If you’re using pure vitamin E oil, mix 1–2 drops for every 10 drops of carrier oil, like jojoba oil, or mix it with a facial lotion.

The bottom line
Numerous vitamin E oils are said to boost your skin and hair health.
Although scientific evidence is lacking for these uses, vitamin E oil is a staple in many people’s beauty routines.
