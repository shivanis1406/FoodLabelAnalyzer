Breakfast cereals are a popular, convenient meal or snack for adults and kids alike.
Yet, many cereals are far from nutritious, as they’re not only low in protein and fiber but also high in added sugar.
Notably, high added sugar intake is linked to an increased risk of several chronic illnesses, including heart disease, obesity, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
Additionally, eating high sugar cereals can lead to increased blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Over time, these elevated levels may allow the disease to progress, as well as increase your risk of complications like heart disease ( 4 ,  5 ).
Nonetheless, numerous sugar-free breakfast cereals are available. Some are simply unsweetened, while others may contain sugar substitutes like stevia, erythritol, or monk fruit.

How we chose these cereals
Healthline evaluated sugar-free cereals based on the following criteria:
Taste.  We checked reviews to make sure that most customers are satisfied with the taste of these cereals.
Ingredient quality.  We looked for products that are made with whole food ingredients — like whole grains, nuts, and seeds — and free of artificial additives or preservatives.
Nutrient content.  The cereals on this list are completely free of added sugars. Most are completely free of sugar, but a few contain a gram or two of naturally occurring sugar per serving.
Suitability for diabetes or the keto diet.  People with diabetes or people following the keto diet may need to watch their sugar and carb intake more closely, so we kept that in mind as we considered these cereals.
Vetting.  The cereals on our list have been vetted to ensure that they align with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being. You can read more about our  vetting process .

Three Wishes is a cereal company started by a couple looking for a healthy cereal option for their family.

Shredded wheat is a classic breakfast cereal made of crunchy wheat biscuits. While many brands are coated in added sugar, Barbara’s Shredded Wheat contains just one ingredient: whole grain wheat.
Certified by the Whole Grain Council and non-GMO verified, Barbara’s Shredded Wheat Cereal is the best whole wheat option thanks to its simple ingredient list and high fiber content.
Regular intake of  whole grains  is associated with a reduced risk of several diseases, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and certain cancers like colorectal cancer ( 11 ,  12 ,  13 ,  14 ).
Furthermore, consumers note that these biscuits don’t get soggy too quickly with milk.

If you’re looking for a breakfast alternative to protein powder or shakes, this cereal may be a great choice. A 1-1/4 cup (60-gram) serving contains 20 grams of protein from milk protein concentrate.
The cereal comes in two flavors: Cocoa Crunch and Fruity Splash, and both flavors have excellent reviews for taste. It’s sweetened with allulose,  monk fruit  extract, and stevia, and the carbs in the cereal come from rice starch.

Fat:  10 grams
Carbs:  26 grams

Puffed rice has been exposed to heat and steam to create a puffy, light texture and mild flavor. It’s commonly used not only in breakfast cereals but also dessert and snack bars for added crunch.
What’s more, puffed rice is often  very low in calories .
Nature’s Path Rice Puffs Cereal is one of the best low calorie, sugar-free options because it’s certified organic and made only with brown rice.
Since this cereal is produced in a facility that processes wheat, it may be cross-contaminated with gluten and isn’t the best choice for people with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity.
Just 1 cup (16 grams) contains ( 18 ):
Calories:  60
Fat:  0 grams
Carbs:  13 grams
Fiber:  1 gram
Sugar:  0 grams
Protein:  1 gram
While low in calories, this cereal is also low in fiber and protein. Thus, it isn’t very filling on its own — though milk, soy milk, or Greek yogurt can help in this regard. You can also combine it with one of the higher protein options on this list.

Available in four flavors, Magic Spoon provides a sugar-free, low carb spin on kids’ cereals.
Made without artificial ingredients, its products are also gluten-, grain-, and soy-free. While they aren’t vegan or dairy-free due to their milk protein, they’re loaded with healthy protein.
Although many kid-friendly cereals contain artificial food dyes, all of Magic Spoon’s products use natural colorings like vegetable juice and  turmeric .
They’re sweetened with a blend of sugar substitutes, including monk fruit, stevia, and allulose.

Oatmeal  is a classic hot breakfast cereal that’s rich in important nutrients, including protein, B vitamins, and several essential minerals ( 20 ,  21 ).
It’s also an excellent source of beta glucan, a type of fiber linked to various health benefits, including improved gut bacteria, lower blood sugar levels, and reduced LDL (bad) and total cholesterol ( 22 ,  23 ,  24 ).
While many brands exist, Nature’s Path is one of the best because its rolled oats are certified organic and non-GMO verified. Best of all, their oats cook up into a creamy texture with a strong oat flavor.
In addition to their Old Fashioned Original Rolled Oats, Nature’s Path offers quick-cooking and steel-cut oats — all of which contain oats as the only ingredient.
One cup (230 grams) of cooked rolled oats provides ( 25 ):
Calories:  150
Fat:  2.5 grams
Carbs:  27 grams
Fiber:  4 grams
Sugar:  0 grams
Protein:  5 grams
To make the amount above, use 1/2 cup (40 grams) of dry rolled oats and 1 cup (237 mL) of water.
Because of its higher carb count, this cereal isn’t keto-friendly. The fiber in oatmeal can help keep blood sugar levels stable, but people with diabetes may need to consume a smaller serving due to its carb content.

In addition to organic gluten-free oats, Purely Elizabeth Original Superfood Oatmeal contains a handful of other organic, nutrient-rich, and gluten-free ingredients — including quinoa flakes and puffed amaranth, as well as flax, hemp, and  chia seeds .
These seeds are often deemed “super seeds” because they’re rich in fiber, plant-based omega-3 fatty acids, and several essential vitamins and minerals ( 26 ,  27 ,  28 ).

Livlo Granolo is one of just a handful of totally sugar-free granola options. Many granolas are drizzled with honey or tossed in brown sugar to add sweetness.
However, these keto-friendly granolas contain combinations of nuts and seeds that are coated in  erythritol  and monk fruit extract, coconut oil, and natural flavors like cinnamon, vanilla, and cocoa.
The three available flavors are Chocolate Hazelnut, Cinnamon Almond Pecan, and Frosted Blueberry.

How to choose a healthy sugar-free breakfast cereal
When shopping for sugar-free cereal, look for products with short ingredient lists that contain mostly whole foods and are free of artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives.
It’s also important to pay attention to the serving size, as you may find that you consume more than one serving in a typical meal.
What type of cereal do you prefer? There are several kinds with different flavors and textures available.
Hot cereals like oatmeal and cream of wheat are popular options, but many premade versions have added sugars. So, try to look for options that are free of added sugars and additives.
Granola  is a common breakfast food that’s made from oats, nuts, seeds, oil, and a sweetener like brown sugar or maple syrup. It’s usually baked until crispy and may feature dried fruit as well.
Additionally, if you prefer a classic cold cereal in milk, there are many options listed above.
Research shows that fiber and protein promote fullness. They cause foods to digest more slowly, which gives them more staying power. This may be useful if you’re trying to lose weight or looking for a breakfast cereal that is more likely to keep you full until lunch ( 6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ).
To help you stay full for longer, try to choose a cereal with at least 3 grams of  fiber  and 4 grams of protein per 1-cup serving.
If you’re avoiding sugar, you’ll need to choose either an unsweetened cereal or a cereal that is sweetened with a zero-calorie sweetener.
Common zero-calorie sweeteners include sugar alcohols like erythritol or xylitol. While these sweeteners don’t provide calories or sugar, they can cause stomach upset in very large doses. So it’s best to limit foods containing these to just one serving ( 32 ,  33 ).
Other zero-calorie sweeteners you may see include allulose, stevia, and monk fruit extract. These sweeteners are derived from natural sources and free of calories and sugar. That said, they are still highly processed.
While these alternative sweeteners are  generally recognized as safe  by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), more research is needed to determine their long-term effects on human health ( 34 ,  35 ).
Sugar-free cereals may be good options for the low carb, high fat keto diet. Though it’s important to note that you should keep a careful eye on the carb count, as some sugar-free cereals are still high in carbs.
Finally, if you have diabetes, make sure that the total carb count fits your allocations for a meal or snack. If you eat cereal with  dairy or nondairy milk , that will add to the carb content.

Frequently asked questions about sugar-free cereals
If you’re looking for a sugar-free cereal, you’ll want to check the ingredients list for any added sugars. There are  over 50 different names  for sugar used on ingredient labels, so it sometimes can be tricky to identify them sometimes.
Some of the most common names for sugar you may see on cereal labels includes corn syrup, fruit juice, honey, and sucrose.
To know for sure if a cereal contains sugar, check the nutrition facts panel. The grams of sugar and added sugar per serving are required to be on this label. If these numbers are not zero grams, then the cereal contains some sugar ( 36 ).
The best cereal for people with diabetes is one that is low in carbs and sugar but also contains some fiber and protein to help lessen its effect on your blood sugar levels and promote fullness ( 6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ).
Depending on your personal carb needs, you may be able to consume cereals that are slightly higher in carbs than some of the cereals featured on this list, but try to choose one that contains fiber and protein.
There are several cereals available that are completely sugar-free, including Magic Spoon and Three Wishes Grain-Free Unsweetened Cereal.

The bottom line
Many  breakfast cereals  are high in sugar. Thus, finding sugar-free options can be especially important for people with diabetes or people on a low carb diet.
Today, several healthy options are on the market.
In addition to choosing a sugar-free product, look for cereals that are a good source of filling fiber and  protein .
