Title: 10 Foods That Are Almost Pure Protein

Protein can be found in a lot of foods, but certain options are better than others. From chicken to egg whites, choose these foods to pack your diet with protein.
Protein is an essential macronutrient that serves many functions in your body.
The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.37 grams (g) per pound (lb) of body weight, or 0.8 g per kilogram (kg) ( 1 ).
However, physically active individuals need 0.6–0.9 g per lb, or 1.4–2 g per kg ( 1 ,  2 ).
Research shows that high protein diets also aid weight loss ( 3 ).
The simplest way to increase your protein intake is to eat more  high protein foods .
That said, not all high protein foods are created equal. Some of them are extremely high in this nutrient, containing almost nothing but protein and water.
Here are 10 foods that are almost pure protein, comprising 70% of calories or more.

1. Chicken breast
Chicken  is one of the most commonly consumed high protein foods.
The breast is the leanest part. Each 3-ounce (oz), or 85 g, serving of roasted, skinless chicken breast will provide you about 27 g of protein and 140 calories ( 4 ).
Some studies show that eating chicken on a  high protein diet  can help you lose weight and increase muscle mass when paired with resistance training. However, the same benefits are also seen when beef is the main protein source ( 5 ,  6 ).
A chicken’s nutrient profile is often affected by its diet. Pasture-raised chickens have higher antioxidant and omega-3 levels ( 7 ).
Besides protein, chicken is a great source of niacin, vitamin B6,  selenium , and phosphorus ( 4 ).
Protein content in 100 g:  31 g (73% of calories)
Chicken breast is a very popular source of protein, with a 3-oz (85-g) breast providing 27 g. It’s also a great source of minerals and B vitamins.

2. Turkey breast
Turkey  is a low fat source of protein. The breast is the leanest part of the bird.
Each 3-oz (85-g) serving of roasted, skinless turkey breast contains about 26 g of protein and 125 calories ( 8 ).
Turkey is also high in  niacin , vitamin B6, and selenium. It’s likewise a good source of phosphorus and zinc ( 8 ).
It also contains high amounts of  tryptophan . This amino acid helps synthesize serotonin, an important neurotransmitter ( 9 ).
Protein content in 100 g:  30 g (82% of calories)
Turkey is a low calorie source of protein, which comprises about 82% of its calories. It also contains B vitamins and minerals, such as selenium and zinc.

3. Egg whites
Like most other animal foods,  eggs  have high quality protein that contains all the amino acids.
Most of the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants in eggs are found in the yolk. However,  egg whites  contain about 60% of the protein in an egg ( 10 ,  11 ).
A 1-cup (243-g) serving of egg whites offers 27 g of protein and only about 126 calories ( 10 ).
Protein content in 100 g:  11 g (85% of calories)
Egg whites mostly consist of water and protein. About 85% of the calories in egg whites are from protein.

4. Dried fish
Dried fish is a tasty snack that comes in many varieties.
For a high protein,  low fat  option, choose cod, halibut, haddock, or flounder.
Just 1 oz (28 g) of dried fish can provide 18 g of protein ( 12 ).
Dried fish has many benefits. For example, it’s also loaded with vitamin B12, potassium,  magnesium , selenium, and other nutrients ( 12 ).
Protein content in 100 g:  63 g (87% of calories)
Dried fish is extremely high in protein, which comprises up to 87% of its calories. It also contains omega-3 fatty acids and large amounts of some vitamins and minerals.

5. Shrimp
Shrimp  is a great food to include in your diet.
It’s not only high in protein but also low in calories, carbs, and fat. A 3-oz (85-g) serving of cooked shrimp contain 19 g of protein and only 101 calories ( 13 ).
Shrimp is rich in selenium,  choline , and vitamin B12. It also contains good amounts of niacin, zinc, vitamin E, and vitamin B6 ( 13 ).
What’s more, shrimp contain antioxidants like  astaxanthin , which reduces inflammation and oxidative damage ( 14 ,  15 ).
Protein content in 100 g:  23 g (77% of calories)
Shrimp is a great source of protein, boasting up to 77% of its calories. It also contains vitamins, minerals, and beneficial antioxidants.

6. Tuna
Tuna is very low in calories and fat, which makes it an almost pure protein food.
A 3-oz (85-g) serving of cooked yellowfin tuna packs about 25 g of protein and only 110 calories ( 16 ).
It’s also a good source of B vitamins, plus minerals like magnesium, phosphorus, and  potassium .
Tuna also has antioxidant properties due to its high amounts of selenium. Just 3.5 oz (100 g) contains 196% of the Daily Value.
Additionally, tuna is a good source of  omega-3 fatty acids , which fight inflammation.
Tuna tends to contain some  mercury , but its high selenium content helps protect against mercury toxicity ( 17 ).
Children and people who are pregnant or nursing can enjoy 2–3 servings of  canned tuna  per week, as it is low in mercury ( 17 ).
These groups should limit their intake of other kinds of tuna that are higher in mercury — including albacore, white tuna, or yellowfin — to around one serving per week ( 17 ).
However, bigeye tuna should be avoided by children and people who are pregnant or breastfeeding due to its mercury content ( 17 ).

Tuna is one of the leanest kinds of fish. It provides 25 g of protein in a 3.5-oz serving but is very low calories.

7. Halibut
Halibut  is another fish that is a great source of complete protein. A 3-oz (85-g) serving of halibut provides 19 g of protein and 94 calories ( 18 ).
Alaskan halibut is also an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which makes it an effective  anti-inflammatory food .
Halibut is likewise high in selenium. In addition, it has good amounts of vitamins B3, B6, and B12 and minerals like magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium ( 18 ).
However, due to its  mercury content , children and people who are pregnant or breastfeeding should limit their intake to one serving per week ( 17 ).

It is a white, freshwater fish that’s a great source of protein yet low in calories and fat.
One fillet (87 g) of tilapia can pack up to 23 g of protein and only 111 calories ( 19 ).
Tilapia has raised some controversy given its higher  omega-6 to omega-3 ratio  than other types of fish, at about 1:1 ( 20 ).
Nonetheless, the amount of omega-6 in a serving of tilapia is not nearly enough to be a cause for concern.
Tilapia is also a great source of B vitamins and minerals like selenium,  phosphorus , and potassium ( 19 ).

Pollock is a popular fish with protein at 86% of calories. It is very low in mercury but a great source of omega-3 fatty acids and other nutrients.

The bottom line
The foods listed above are rich in  protein .
Many have other health benefits as well due to their high content of omega-3s, vitamins, and minerals.
