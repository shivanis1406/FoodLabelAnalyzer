Title: Are Mushrooms Keto-Friendly?

Mushrooms may be keto-friendly because they’re low in carbohydrates. These may include white button, portobello, raw oyster, and shiitake mushrooms.
The ketogenic, or keto, diet is designed to be very low in carbohydrates and high in fat with moderate amounts of protein ( 1 ).
While originally designed to help manage epileptic seizures in children, the keto diet today is often used to promote weight loss and support type 2 diabetes ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
Most people who follow a keto diet limit their total carbohydrate intake to fewer than 50 grams per day to achieve and maintain a state of ketosis. Ketosis is when your body uses ketone bodies rather than glucose as a primary source of energy ( 2 ).
To stay within your desired keto carb range, it’s helpful to know the general carb content of popular foods you enjoy. You may be wondering about the carbohydrates and nutrition of different types of mushrooms.
This article examines whether mushrooms are considered a keto-friendly food, and offers a few ideas for how to eat them on a keto diet.

Naturally low in carbs
There are many varieties of  mushrooms , and the most common types are naturally low in carbohydrates in their natural form.
For example, a 1-cup (96-gram) serving of raw, whole white button mushrooms contributes 3 grams of carbs to your day. A cup of raw oyster and shiitake mushrooms contains around 6 and 7 grams of carbs, respectively ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ).
If you like portobello mushrooms, you’ll find around 3 grams of carbs in both a 1-cup (86-gram) serving of them diced, or an average mushroom cap you might use to make a meatless burger ( 7 ).
Not only are mushrooms low in carbs, but they come with fiber. Fiber can be tough to get on the keto diet since it’s found in carb-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Some  low carb  foods  pack fiber, such as mushrooms, avocado, nuts, and seeds.
It seems unlikely that you would go over your daily carb limit by making mushrooms a regular part of your diet, unless you’re planning to eat 6 cups a day or preparing them as part of an otherwise carb-heavy grain dish.
As for canned or other packaged mushroom products, be sure to read the nutrition label, as these may not be as keto-friendly.
For instance, 1/2-cup (120-mL) serving of Campbell’s Cream of Mushroom prepared soup contains 8 grams of carbs, and you’ll find 2.5 servings per can, contributing 20 grams of carbs total ( 8 ).
Common types of mushrooms, like white button, shiitake, oyster, and portobello, are low in carbohydrates and keto-friendly in their natural form. However, it’s a good idea to check labels on canned mushroom products.

How to eat mushrooms on a keto diet
Mushrooms are highly nutritious. They can be enjoyed both raw and cooked, and used in a variety of ways that are suitable for a keto diet.
While low in carbs, they’re high in fiber, B vitamins, and minerals like selenium, copper, and potassium. Plus, they contain several  antioxidants , like ergothioneine and glutathione, which can help protect your cells from oxidative damage ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  9 ).
Try incorporating mushrooms in some of the following ways:
sliced raw and mixed into a leafy green  salad
cooked with scrambled eggs or added to an omelet
sauteed with olive or coconut oil, garlic, and herbs on the stovetop
added to a stir-fry with zucchini noodles, low carb veggies, and tofu
boiled in water to make a mushroom broth for soups
stuffed with keto-friendly ingredients like cream cheese, butter, shredded cheddar, or bacon, and roasted in the oven with fresh herbs
used in a creamy mushroom soup
grilled and used to layer a low carb sandwich
diced and used in veggie burger patties, made with riced cauliflower, garlic, onion, celery, cheese, and seasonings
added to soups, stews, or casseroles
Mushrooms are packed with nutrients and can be used in a variety of ways, both raw and cooked. You might enjoy them in salads, soups, stir-fries, and scrambles.

The bottom line
Mushrooms, like oyster, shiitake, white button, and portobello, are naturally low in carbohydrates, making them a keto-friendly food.
Enjoy them raw or cooked, in dishes like stir-fry, casseroles, scrambles, soups, or stuffed with low carb ingredients like cream cheese and  bacon .
However, if you’re considering buying a canned mushroom product, like cream of mushroom  soup , be sure to read the nutrition label, as these items will generally be higher in carbs and might not fit into your daily limit.
Try this today : Make mushroom “bacon.”
Thinly slice 2 cups (200 grams) of shiitake mushrooms. Toss gently in a mixture of 1 tbsp. (14 mL) each of sesame oil, coconut aminos, and liquid smoke, with a pinch of paprika and 1 tsp. (5 mL) of sugar-free maple syrup.
Cook on medium heat in a skillet until crispy.
