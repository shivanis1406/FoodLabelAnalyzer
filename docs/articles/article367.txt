Title: Top 12 Foods That Are High in Vitamin B12

The foods containing vitamin B12 are primarily animal meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. Vegetarians, people who are pregnant or nursing, and others who are at risk of deficiency may need to take supplements.
Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin with many essential functions in your body.
It’s necessary for keeping your nerves healthy and supporting the production of DNA and red blood cells, as well as maintaining typical brain function.
The Reference Daily Intake (RDI) is about  2.4 micrograms (mcg)  but slightly higher for those who are pregnant or nursing.
Vitamin B12 is absorbed in your stomach with the help of a protein called intrinsic factor. This substance binds to the vitamin B12 molecule and helps your blood and cells absorb it.
Excess vitamin B12 is stored in your liver. If you consume more than the RDI, your body saves it for future use.
Your body can’t make vitamin B12, so you must get it from your diet or supplements. Here are 12 foods rich in vitamin B12 to consider adding to your diet.

1. Animal liver and kidneys
Organ meats  are some of the most nutrient-packed foods. The liver and kidneys, especially from lamb, are rich in vitamin B12.
A  3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving  of lamb liver provides an incredible 3,571% of the Daily Value (DV) for vitamin B12.
While lamb  liver  is generally higher in vitamin B12 than  beef  or  veal , the latter two may still contain about 3,000% DV per 3.5 ounces (100 grams).
Lamb’s liver is also very high in copper, selenium, and vitamins A and B2.
Lamb, veal, and beef kidneys are likewise high in vitamin B12. Lamb’s kidneys  provide  about 3,000% of the DV per 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving, plus more than 100% for vitamin B2 and selenium.

2. Clams
Clams are small, chewy  shellfish  that are packed with nutrients.
This mollusk is a lean source of protein and  contains  very high concentrations of vitamin B12. You can get over 7,000% of the DV in 20 small clams (190 grams).
Clams, especially whole baby clams, also provide a  great amount  of iron, with almost 200% of the DV in a 100-gram (3.5-ounce) serving.
Plus, clams are a  good source  of antioxidants.
Interestingly, the  broth  of boiled clams is also high in vitamin B12. Canned clam broth  has been shown  to provide 113–588% of the DV per 3.5 ounces (100 grams).

3. Sardines
Sardines  are small, soft-boned saltwater fish. They’re usually sold canned in water, oil, or sauces, though you can also buy them fresh.
Sardines are especially nutritious because they contain good amounts of almost every single nutrient. A  1-cup (150-gram) serving  of drained sardines provides 554% of the DV for vitamin B12.
Furthermore, sardines are an excellent source of  omega-3 fatty acids , which  have been shown  to provide many health benefits, such as reducing inflammation and improving heart health.

4. Beef
Beef  is an excellent source of vitamin B12. One grilled flat iron steak ( about 190 grams ) provides 467% of the DV for vitamin B12.
The same amount of steak contains reasonable amounts of vitamins B2, B3, and B6, as well as more than 100% of the DVs for selenium and zinc.
If you’re looking for higher concentrations of vitamin B12, it’s  recommended  to choose low fat cuts of meat. It’s also  better to  grill or roast it — instead of  frying  — to preserve the B12 content.

5. Fortified cereal
This source of vitamin B12 may work well for vegetarians and vegans because it’s synthetically made and not derived from animal sources.
Although not commonly recommended as part of a healthy diet,  fortified cereals  can be a good source of B vitamins, especially B12. Food fortification is the process of adding nutrients that are not originally in the food.
For instance, Malt-O-Meal Raisin Bran offers up to 62% of the DV for vitamin B12 in  1 cup (59 grams) . The same serving of this cereal also packs 29% of the DV for vitamin B6 and good amounts of vitamin A, folate, and iron.
Research shows  that eating fortified cereals daily helps increase vitamin B12 concentrations.
One  older 2004 study  showed that when participants ate 1 cup (240 mL) of fortified cereal containing 4.8 mcg (200% of the DV) of vitamin B12 daily for 14 weeks, their B12 levels increased significantly.
If you use fortified cereal to increase your vitamin B12 intake, choose a product that’s low in  added sugar  and high in fiber or whole grains.

6. Tuna
Tuna is a commonly consumed fish and a great source of nutrients, including protein, vitamins, and minerals.
It contains high concentrations of vitamin B12,  especially  in the muscles just beneath the skin, known as dark muscles.
A  3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving  of cooked tuna contains 453% of the DV for the vitamin. This same serving size also packs lean protein, phosphorus,  selenium , and vitamins A and B3.
Canned tuna  also contains a decent amount of vitamin B12.  One can (165 grams)  of light tuna in water contains 152% of the DV.

7. Fortified nutritional yeast
Nutritional yeast  is a good source of protein, vitamins, and minerals. It’s a species of yeast specifically grown for food, not as a leavening agent in bread and beer.
Nutritional yeast does not naturally contain vitamin B12. However, it’s commonly fortified, which makes it a great source of this nutrient.
As with fortified cereals, the vitamin B12 in nutritional yeast is vegan-friendly because it’s synthetic. Two tablespoons (15 grams) of nutritional yeast  may contain  up to 733% of the DV for vitamin B12.
In  one older 2000 study , researchers added nutritional yeast to the diets of  raw food vegans  and found that it increased vitamin B12 blood levels and helped reduce blood markers of B12 deficiency.

8. Trout
Rainbow trout is a great source of protein,  healthy fats , and B vitamins.
A  3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving  of trout fillet offers about 312% of the DV for vitamin B12 and 1,171 mg of omega-3 fatty acids.
For adults,  experts recommend  a combined daily intake of 1,100–1,600 mg of omega-3 fatty acids.
Trout is also a great source of minerals such as  manganese , phosphorus, and selenium.

9. Salmon
Salmon  is well known for having one of the highest concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids. It’s also an excellent source of B vitamins.
A  half fillet (178 grams)  of cooked salmon can pack 208% of the DV for vitamin B12. The same serving may also provide 4,123 mg of omega-3 fatty acids.
Alongside its high fat content, this  fish  offers a high amount of protein, with about 40 grams in a half fillet (178 grams).

10. Fortified nondairy milk
Nondairy milk is popular among those who want a nutritious vegan  replacement for dairy milk .
While soy, almond, and rice milk are not naturally high in vitamin B12, they are usually fortified, which makes them an excellent source of this vitamin.
One example is soy milk, which  provides  up to 86% of the DV for vitamin B12 in 1 cup (240 mL).

11. Cow’s milk and other dairy products
Milk and other  dairy products , such as yogurt and cheese, are great protein sources and several vitamins and minerals, including vitamin B12.
One cup (240 ml)  of whole milk supplies 46% of the DV for vitamin B12.
Cheese is also a rich source of vitamin B12.  One large slice (22 grams)  of Swiss cheese contains about 28% of the DV.
Full-fat plain  yogurt  may also be a  decent source . It h as even been shown  to help improve vitamin B12 status in people who are deficient in this vitamin.
Interestingly,  research has found  that your body absorbs the vitamin B12 in milk and dairy products better than the vitamin B12 in beef, fish, or eggs.

12. Eggs
Eggs  are a great source of protein and B vitamins, especially B2 and B12.
Two large eggs (100 grams)  supply about 46% of the DV for vitamin B12, plus 39% of the DV for vitamin B2.
Research  has shown  that egg yolks have higher levels of vitamin B12 than egg whites. The B12 in  egg yolks  is also easier to absorb. Therefore, it’s recommended to eat whole eggs instead of just their whites.
In addition to getting a good dose of vitamin B12, you’ll get a healthy amount of vitamin D. Eggs are one of the few foods that naturally contain it, with 11% of the DV in two large eggs.

Should you take vitamin B12 supplements?
Vitamin B12 supplements are recommended for people who are at risk of  vitamin B12 deficiency , including:
older adults
people who are pregnant or nursing
vegetarians and vegans
people with intestinal conditions
people who have had stomach surgery
Like the vitamin B12 in fortified sources, the B12 in supplements is synthetic, so it’s vegan-friendly.
Vitamin B12 supplements can be found in many forms. You can swallow, chew, or drink them or place them under your tongue. A healthcare professional can also  inject  you with vitamin B12.
Research  has shown  that vitamin B12 taken by mouth and muscular injection are equally effective at restoring B12 levels in people with a deficiency.
One  2011 study  found that people with low levels of vitamin B12 replenished their stores after 90 days of either supplements or injections.
However, vitamin B12 deficiency is not always caused by inadequate dietary intake. It’s sometimes caused by a lack of intrinsic factor.
Lack of intrinsic factor is most common in older people and is usually associated with an autoimmune disease called  pernicious anemia .
The most common treatment for pernicious anemia is lifelong vitamin B12 injections, but small amounts of vitamin B12 are absorbed without intrinsic factor.
One 2016 review  concluded that taking 1,000 mcg daily is an effective alternative to injections.
