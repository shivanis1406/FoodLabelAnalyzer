Title: What to Eat and Avoid If You're Trying to Build Muscle

Your diet can make or break your results at the gym. It’s important to eat a wide variety of nutrient-rich foods across different food groups. Limit or avoid alcohol, foods with added sugars, and deep-fried foods.
Bodybuilding differs from powerlifting or Olympic lifting in that it’s judged on a competitor’s physical appearance rather than physical strength.
As such, bodybuilders aspire to develop and maintain a well-balanced, lean, and muscular physique.
To do this, many bodybuilders start with an off-season followed by an in-season way of eating, referred to as a bulking and cutting phase.
During the bulking phase, which can last months to years, bodybuilders eat a high calorie, protein-rich diet and lift weights intensely with the goal of building as much muscle as possible.
The following cutting phase focuses on losing as much fat as possible while maintaining muscle mass developed during the bulking phase. This involves specific changes in diet and exercise over 12–26 weeks.

First, determine how many calories you need in your overall diet
The easiest way to determine how many calories you need is to weigh yourself at least 3 times a week and record what you eat using a  calorie tracking app .
If your weight stays the same throughout the week, the amount of calories you eat is considered your “maintenance” level. You’re not losing or gaining weight but maintaining it.
Aim to increase  your calorie intake by about 15% during your bulking phase. For example, if you eat 3,000 calories daily to maintain weight, you should eat around 3,450 calories daily (3,000 x 0.15 = 450) to bulk.
Decrease your maintenance calories by about 15% to transition from a bulking to a cutting phase. In this example, you would consume 2,550 calories per day instead of 3,450.
Plan to revisit your calorie goals every month to account for changes in your weight. Increase your calories as you  gain weight  in the bulking phase and decrease your calories as you lose weight in the cutting phase for continued progression.
It’s important to avoid losing or gaining  more than 0.5–1%  of your body weight per week. This ensures you don’t lose too much muscle during the cutting phase or gain too much body fat during the bulking phase.

Next, determine your ratio of macronutrients
This is  the ratio between  your protein, carbohydrate, and fat intake. Protein and carbs contain 4 calories per gram (g), and fat contains 9.
Your macronutrient ratio will stay the same regardless of whether you’re in a bulking or cutting phase. A typical diet includes:
30–35% calories from protein
55–60% calories from carbs
15–20% calories from fat
It’s best to consult a registered dietician to determine your individual needs and ensure your diet is nutritionally adequate.
Using the calorie example outlined in the previous section, your macronutrient ratio might look like the following:

Foods to eat to support your overall fitness
You can usually eat the same foods while bulking or cutting — it’s the amount, not the content, that fluctuates.
Do what you can to  prioritize the following  foods:
Meats, poultry, and fish:  Sirloin  steak , ground beef,  pork  tenderloin,  venison , chicken breast, salmon, tilapia, and cod
Dairy:  Yogurt, cottage cheese,  low fat milk , and cheese
Grains:  Bread, cereal, crackers, oatmeal,  quinoa , popcorn, and rice
Fruits:  Oranges, apples, bananas, grapes, pears, peaches, watermelon, and berries
Starchy vegetables:  Sweet potatoes, corn, green peas, green lima beans, and  cassava
Vegetables:  Broccoli,  leafy greens , tomatoes, green beans, cucumber, zucchini, asparagus, peppers, and mushrooms
Seeds and nuts:  Almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds,  chia seeds , and flax seeds
Beans and legumes:  Chickpeas,  lentils , kidney beans, black beans, and pinto beans
Oils:  Olive oil,  flaxseed oil , and avocado oil

Foods to limit or avoid to support your overall fitness
While it’s important to eat a variety of different foods, there are some you should limit when bulking and cutting:
Alcohol:   Alcohol  can negatively affect  your ability to  build muscle and lose fat, especially if consumed in excess.
Added sugars:  These offer plenty of calories but  few nutrients . Foods high in added sugars include candy, cookies, doughnuts, ice cream, cake, and sugar-sweetened beverages, such as soda and  sports drinks .
Deep-fried foods:  These  may promote  inflammation and — when consumed in excess — disease. Examples include fried fish, french fries, onion rings, chicken strips, and cheese curds.
Before going to the gym, you may want to avoid foods that can slow digestion or cause stomach upset during your workout. This includes:
High fat foods:  Fatty meats , buttery foods, and heavy sauces or creams
High fiber foods:  Beans and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli or cauliflower
Carbonated beverages:  Sparkling water or diet soda

Dietary supplements to consider
Many bodybuilders  take dietary supplements  to help support their overall fitness. However, it’s important to consult a healthcare professional before adding anything new to your routine.
If you haven’t already, talk with a primary care physician or other clinician about:
Whey protein:  Adding whey protein powder to smoothies or shakes can be a convenient way to increase your protein intake.
Creatine:   Creatine  can give your muscles the energy to perform an additional rep. While there are many brands of creatine, creatine monohydrate is considered the  most effective .
Caffeine:   Caffeine  can help  decrease fatigue . Pre-workout supplements, coffee, and tea are often high in caffeine.

Sample meal plan
Traditional bodybuilding diets  typically contain  limited food selections and little variety among and within food groups, leading to an inadequate intake of essential minerals and vitamins.
For this reason, it’s important to incorporate variety into your diet to ensure your nutritional needs are met — especially during a cutting phase when you eat limited calories.
A typical week of meals might look like the following:
Breakfast:  Scrambled eggs with mushrooms, oatmeal, and a pear
Snack:  Low-fat cottage cheese with blueberries
Lunch:  Venison burger, white rice, and broccoli
Snack:  Protein shake and a banana
Dinner:  Salmon , quinoa, and asparagus
Breakfast:   Protein pancakes  with light syrup, peanut butter, and raspberries
Snack:  Hard-boiled eggs and an apple
Lunch:  Sirloin steak, sweet potato, and spinach salad with vinaigrette

Dinner:  Ground turkey and marinara sauce over pasta, with a side of cauliflower
Breakfast:  Chicken sausage with egg, roasted potatoes, and an apple
Snack:  Greek yogurt, strawberries, and almonds
Lunch:  Turkey breast,  basmati rice , and mushrooms

Snack:  Protein balls  with almond butter and an orange
Lunch:  Pork tenderloin slices with roasted garlic potatoes, green beans, and carrots
Snack:  Protein shake and strawberries
Dinner:  Turkey meatballs, marinara sauce, and parmesan cheese over pasta, with a side of  sautéed kale

Benefits of bodybuilding
Bodybuilders frequently exercise to maintain and build muscles, performing resistance and aerobic training.
Resistance training increases muscle strength and size. Muscle strength is  linked with  a lower risk of dying from cancer, heart disease, and kidney disease, as well as several other critical illnesses.
Aerobic exercise, which bodybuilders regularly implement to reduce body fat,  improves  heart health and significantly lowers your risk of developing or dying from heart disease — the  leading cause  of death in America.
In addition to exercise, bodybuilders also focus on their nutrition.
Following a healthy eating pattern, including  nutrient-dense foods  from all food groups in appropriate amounts, can  significantly  lower your risk of chronic diseases.

Potential risks to consider
For the most part, bodybuilding is a lifestyle associated with several health benefits, but there are some things to know before embarking on this journey.
To prepare for a bodybuilding competition, competitors develop  extremely low body fat  levels, with males and females typically reaching body fat levels of 5–10% and 10–15%, respectively.
A low level of body fat, combined with low calorie intake, has been shown to decrease  sleep quality , negatively affect mood, and weaken the immune system in the weeks  leading up to  a competition.
These effects may also last for several weeks  afterward .
Many, but not all, adverts for  muscle-building supplements  involve bodybuilders  who use  performance-enhancing drugs, such as  anabolic steroids .
This misleads many people into believing they can achieve the same muscular look by taking the advertised supplement.
In turn, many bodybuilders, especially those beginning their journey, develop unrealistic expectations of what they can accomplish naturally. This  may lead to  body dissatisfaction and, eventually, the urge to try anabolic steroids.
However, anabolic steroids are very unhealthy and  linked to  several risks and side effects.
In addition to being illegal to possess in the US without a prescription,  using anabolic steroids  can increase your risk of heart disease, decrease fertility, and result in mental health conditions like depression.

The bottom line
Bodybuilding focuses on muscularity and leanness rather than athletic performance. Achieving the desired look requires regular exercise and special attention to your diet.
Dieting typically involves bulking and cutting phases, during which your calorie intake will fluctuate while your macronutrient ratio remains stable.
Your diet should include nutrient-dense foods and plenty of protein. You should also limit alcohol, added sugars, and deep-fried foods.
