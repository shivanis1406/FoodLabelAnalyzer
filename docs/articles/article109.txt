Title: Are Spicy Takis Chips Bad for Your Health?

Takis are a type of rolled corn tortilla chip known for their spicy, intense taste.
They’re available in several flavors, including Fuego, Nitro, Blue Heat, and Crunchy Fajitas.
But despite their popularity, many people are unsure whether this spicy snack can be enjoyed as part of a healthy diet.
This article evaluates whether Takis chips are bad for you.

Lacking important nutrients
Takis are high in calories, fat, carbs, and sodium but lack other essential  micronutrients .
A 1-ounce (28-gram) package of Takis Fuego contains the following nutrients ( 1 ):
Calories:  140
Protein:  2 grams
Fat:  8 grams
Carbs:  16 grams
Sodium:  16% of the Daily Value (DV)
Calcium:  4% of the DV
Iron:  2% of the DV
Although Takis contain some calcium and iron per serving, this amount is not considered significant.
Additionally, keep in mind that many people eat more than  one serving at a time , which increases the total amount of calories, fat, and carbs they consume.
Takis are high in calories, fat, carbs, and sodium but lack important vitamins and minerals.

Rich in sodium
Like other salty snacks, Takis are high in  sodium , packing a whopping 390 mg into each 1-ounce (28-gram) serving ( 1 ).
Although sodium is important for several aspects of your health, consuming too much can cause negative side effects ( 2 ).
In fact, studies show that  high sodium consumption  may be linked to increased blood pressure ( 3 ).
As such, people with high blood pressure are advised to reduce their daily sodium intake to help lower their blood pressure levels and improve their heart health ( 4 ,  5 ).
Furthermore, other research suggests that increased consumption of sodium-rich foods may be linked to a higher risk of stomach cancer ( 6 ).
According to the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans, it’s recommended that most adults limit their sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day to avoid adverse health effects ( 7 ).
Takis are high in sodium. Consuming high amounts of sodium may increase your blood pressure levels and has been associated with a higher risk of stomach cancer.

Highly processed
In addition to being rich in sodium and low in essential nutrients, Takis chips are  highly processed  and refined.
Studies show that regularly eating processed foods, including Takis, may be linked to a higher risk of heart disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes ( 8 ).
One recent review among 184,000 people found that those who consumed the highest amount of processed food were 39% more likely to have overweight or obesity and excess  belly fat  ( 9 ).
Plus, a study in 44,451 people showed that increased intake of processed foods was tied to a higher risk of death over an average of 7 years ( 10 ).
Takis chips are highly processed. Increased intake of processed foods may be linked to a higher risk of obesity and several chronic health conditions.

Effects on digestive health
Takis, along with other spicy snacks like Hot Cheetos or Spicy Nacho Doritos, can irritate the lining of your stomach if you consume large amounts of them ( 11 ,  12 ).
This can sometimes contribute to  gastritis , a condition characterized by stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting ( 13 ).
One study showed that of 526 questionnaires among people with gastritis, over 25% reported that their symptoms were triggered by eating spicy foods ( 11 ).
In some people, spicy foods can also trigger gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms (GERD), worsening issues like  heartburn  and indigestion ( 14 ,  15 ).
Some studies also suggest that eating spicy foods may trigger symptoms like stomach pain among people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) ( 16 ,  17 ,  18 ).
Therefore, you should consider limiting your consumption of Takis if you are affected by these conditions, especially if you find spicy foods cause or worsen any digestive issues.
Spicy foods like Takis may contribute to gastritis and trigger digestive symptoms among people with GERD or IBS.

Moderation is key
Although Takis may not be the healthiest snack option available, it’s OK for most people to enjoy them in moderation from time to time.
Be sure to monitor your portion sizes carefully and stick to one serving at a time to avoid overeating.
Keep in mind that 1 ounce (28 grams) is considered a single serving of Takis. This equals approximately 12 pieces.
Be sure to enjoy Takis as part of a nutritious,  well-rounded diet  and pair them with various other healthy snacks.
Air-popped popcorn, homemade veggie chips, cheese and crackers, mixed nuts, and edamame are a few other examples of  salty snacks  that can help satisfy your cravings.
Although Takis aren’t necessarily healthy, they can be enjoyed in moderation as part of a nutritious, well-rounded diet.

The bottom line
Takis are a type of rolled  corn tortilla chip  that are popular for their spicy and intense flavor.
In addition to being highly processed, Takis are rich in sodium and low in important vitamins and minerals.
Furthermore, they may worsen digestive issues for some people, including those with conditions like acid reflux (GERD) or  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) .
While Takis may not be the healthiest snack available, they’re generally fine to enjoy in moderation as part of a balanced and nutritious diet.
