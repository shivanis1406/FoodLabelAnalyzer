It’s hard to beat a cool, sweet, creamy scoop of ice cream on a hot summer day — or any other time of year.
Although small amounts of ice cream can be part of a balanced diet, this dessert often contains large amounts of added sugar. In fact, some flavors have up to three times the daily recommended intake of added sugar in a single serving.
That’s one reason sugar-free options have become increasingly popular.
These desserts rely on natural or artificial sweeteners that drastically lower their sugar and calorie content.
These sweeteners may come with their own downsides, such as digestive symptoms like gas or  bloating , when consumed in large amounts. However, sugar-free ice cream can make a terrific treat as long as you keep your intake in check ( 1 ,  2 ).
Here are 9 of the best sugar-free and low sugar ice creams.

Skinny Cow has offered popular low fat ice creams since the 1990s.
The brand recently bolstered its product line with no-sugar-added ice cream sandwiches, which contain fiber and  protein  and are remarkably creamy for being so low in fat and sugar.
However, the ingredients aren’t as high quality as those of many competing products. These sandwiches include several  food additives  and rely on sugar alcohols and artificial sweeteners.
You can find Skinny Cow products in numerous grocery stores and supermarkets in the United States.

You can use frozen ripe bananas to make simple, delicious low sugar ice cream at home.
Widely dubbed “nice cream,” fruit-based ice cream requires only a few ingredients and a food processor or blender. For this one, you just need to blend a frozen ripe  banana , a splash of dairy or nondairy milk, and any additional flavorings you desire.
Given that bananas are naturally sweet, you don’t need to add any sweeteners. That said, you can include stevia drops or monk fruit to boost the sweetness to your liking.
To vary the flavor, you can mix in vanilla bean paste,  cocoa powder , or other frozen fruits like mangoes, peaches, or raspberries. You can also add sugar-free nut or seed butter to impart protein and a rich, creamy texture.
The nutritional content depends on your specific ingredients, but a serving using 1 small banana (100 grams) and 2 ounces (60 mL) of unsweetened almond milk provides approximately ( 15 ,  16 ):
Calories:  100
Fat:  1 gram
Protein:  1 gram
Carbs:  24 grams
Fiber:  2.8 grams
Sugar:  13 grams (all natural, none added)
Although homemade banana-based ice cream doesn’t contain any added sugar, the natural sugars in the fruit contribute to your total carb intake. Thus, if you’re watching your carb intake or blood sugar levels, you should eat small servings or choose a different ice cream.
If you’re looking for a homemade ice cream that doesn’t contain added sugars and is low in carbs, try using full fat coconut milk as a base.
For a classic vanilla flavor, mix coconut milk with vanilla extract, a pinch of salt, and your favorite sugar-free sweetener — stevia, monk fruit, and sugar alcohols work well. Other sugar-free ingredients like  nut butters ,  matcha , and cocoa powder make great optional add-ins.
Freeze the mixture in small, blender-friendly portions, allow it to thaw slightly, then blend it until smooth and creamy.
A 1/2-cup (113-gram) serving with no extra ingredients provides approximately ( 17 ):
Calories:  223
Fat:  24 grams
Protein:  2 grams
Carbs:  3 grams
Fiber:  0 grams
Sugar:  1.5 grams
Although there’s no sugar added and it’s very low in carbs, this particular ice cream is  higher in fat  and calories than many other options. Thus, if you’re following a low fat diet or trying to reduce your calorie intake, it may not be the best choice.

How to choose the best one
The right sugar-free or low sugar ice cream for you depends on your dietary goals and personal tastes.
If you want to  improve your blood sugar regulation , focus on total carb content. Regardless of the source, carbs can contribute to blood sugar increases.
Therefore, look for sugar-free ice creams that are low in total carbs.
It may also be worthwhile to buy products that are rich in protein and fiber, as these nutrients can help minimize potential  blood sugar spikes  ( 6 ,  7 ).
If you’re  counting calories , opt for ice creams with the lowest calorie content. These options are usually lower in fat, as fat has more calories per gram than other macronutrients.
That said, if you prefer higher fat versions for their creaminess, you can still eat them. You’ll just want to watch your  portion sizes  so that you stay within your calorie limits.
If you’re focused on food quality, be sure to pay close attention to ingredients.
In some cases,  regular ice cream  may contain more nutrient-dense whole foods than sugar-free alternatives.
Many light or low sugar ice creams contain lots of additives, such as preservatives, gums, artificial colors, and stabilizers, to create an appearance and consistency similar to those of regular ice cream.
Though these ingredients aren’t likely to cause side effects, especially in the small amounts present, some people may still wish to avoid them.
In particular, sensitive individuals may experience allergic reactions or uncomfortable digestive symptoms after consuming additives ( 18 ).
For instance, excess consumption of sugar alcohols like xylitol or gums like xanthan gum may increase gas and  bloating  in some people. People may also experience allergic reactions to artificial colors ( 1 ,  19 ,  20 ).
If you know you’re sensitive to any of these ingredients, steer clear of products with additives.
Homemade options are almost always the best choice to ensure whole, high quality ingredients, as you have complete control over the ingredients and level of sweetness.

Comparing brands

Frequently asked questions
Low sugar and sugar-free ice cream are good options for people with diabetes who are looking to enjoy a sweet treat that will not affect their blood sugar levels as much as regular ice creams would.
Evidence on artificial sweeteners is mixed. Many are considered safe to consume ( 21 ).
However, some people may experience side effects from certain types of sweeteners.
It depends on your goals, diet, and individual needs. For example, you may want to search for a dairy-free ice cream if you follow a vegan diet, or a low carb one if you follow a keto diet.
Additionally, some people may experience digestive side effects from sugar alcohols. If that’s the case for you, look for an option sweetened with stevia or monk fruit.

The bottom line
Ice cream is a beloved classic dessert, but it tends to be very high in  added sugar .
If you don’t want to give up this dessert but are trying to reduce your sugar intake, consider one of the sugar-free or low sugar ice creams on this list.
It’s also easy to make your own by using  fruit  like coconut or banana as a base.
