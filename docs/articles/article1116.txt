Title: Chia Seeds Nutrition Facts, Benefits, and Downsides

Chia seeds contain large amounts of fiber and omega-3 fatty acids, some protein, and many essential minerals and antioxidants. They may help improve digestive health, lower blood pressure, and improve blood sugar control.
Chia seeds are the tiny black seeds of the chia plant ( Salvia hispanica ).
Native to Mexico and Guatemala, they were a staple food for the ancient Aztecs and Mayans.
Chia seeds are small, flat, and oval-shaped with a shiny and smooth texture. Their color ranges from white to brown or black.
These seeds are highly versatile. They can be soaked and added to porridge, made into pudding, used in baked goods, or simply sprinkled on top of salads or yogurt.
Because of their ability to absorb liquid and form a gel, they can also be used to thicken sauces or as an egg replacement.
This article provides everything you need to know about chia seeds.

Nutrition facts
Chia seeds contain 138  calories  per ounce (28 grams).
By weight, they are  6%  water,  42%  carbohydrates (of which  82%  is fiber),  31%  fat, and  17%  protein.
The nutrients in  one ounce (28.35 grams)  of chia seeds are:
Calories:  138
Protein:  4.7 grams
Carbs:  11.9 grams
Sugar:  0 grams
Fiber:  9.8 grams
Fat:  8.7 grams  Saturated:  0.9 grams Monounsaturated:  0.7 grams Polyunsaturated:  6.7 grams Omega-3:  5 grams Omega-6:  1.7 grams
Saturated:  0.9 grams
Monounsaturated:  0.7 grams
Polyunsaturated:  6.7 grams
Omega-3:  5 grams
Omega-6:  1.7 grams
Notably, chia seeds are also free of gluten.
More than 80% of the  carb  content of chia seeds is in the form of fiber.
A single ounce (28.35 grams) of chia seeds boasts  9.75 grams  of fiber, which is a significant portion of the Daily Value (DV) of  28 grams  per day.
Chia seeds contain 85-93% insoluble and 7-15% soluble fiber.
Chia fiber may also be fermented in your gut, promoting the formation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and improving colon health.
One of the unique characteristics of chia seeds is their high content of heart-healthy  omega-3 fatty acids .
About  60%  of the fats in chia seeds consist of the omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), while  about 20%  consist of omega-6 fatty acids.
In fact, chia seeds are the best known plant-based source of omega-3 fatty acids — even better than flaxseed.
According to a  2019 review  of studies, ALA reduces cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure, and is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. It may also improve cognition, but more research is needed.
The ALA found in chia needs to be converted into the active forms (EPA and DHA) before your body can use it, and this process is often inefficient.
Chia seeds contain  5 grams of protein  per one-ounce serving — a similar amount to other seeds but more than most cereals and  grains .
Studies show  that high  protein intake  is associated with increased fullness after meals and reduced food intake.
Notably, these seeds  offer all nine  essential amino acids and are thus a high quality plant-based protein. However, they are not recommended as the sole protein source in anyone’s diet. Protein sources should be varied, whether you’re vegan or not.

Vitamins and minerals
One ounce  of chia seeds provides significant amounts of many minerals and some vitamins, particularly thiamine (15% of the DV) and niacin (16% of the DV).
The most abundant minerals are:
Manganese  (23% of the DV). Whole grains and seeds are rich in manganese, which is essential for metabolism, growth, and development.
Phosphorus  (20% of the DV). Usually found in protein-rich foods, phosphorus contributes to bone health and tissue maintenance.
Copper  (29% of the DV). A mineral often lacking in the modern diet,  copper  is important for heart health.
Selenium  (29% of the DV). An important antioxidant, selenium is involved in many processes in your body.
Iron  (22% of the DV). As a component of hemoglobin in red blood cells,  iron  is involved in the transport of oxygen throughout your body. It may be poorly absorbed from chia seeds due to their phytic acid content.
Magnesium  (23% of the DV). Often lacking in the Western diet, magnesium plays important roles in many bodily processes.
Calcium.  The most abundant mineral in your body, calcium is essential for bones, muscles, and nerves.
The absorption of some minerals, such as iron and zinc,  may be reduced  because of the phytic acid content of chia seeds.

Other plant compounds
Chia seeds contain a number of beneficial plant compounds, including:
Chlorogenic acid.  This antioxidant, which is also found in coffee and fruit,  may have benefits  for heart health.
Caffeic acid.  This substance is abundant in many plant foods and  may help  fight  inflammation  in your body.
Quercetin.  This powerful antioxidant  may protect  heart health and reduce the risk of cancer.
Kaempferol.  This antioxidant has been  associated with  a decreased risk of cancer and other chronic diseases.
Clean, dry chia seeds have an  extended shelf life , as their antioxidants protect their fats from damage.

Health benefits of chia seeds
Chia seeds have become increasingly popular in recent years because of their high nutritional value and alleged health benefits.
Their main  health benefits  are listed below.
Omega-3 fatty acids are incredibly important for your body and brain, and chia seeds are an excellent source of the omega-3  ALA .
However, ALA needs to be converted into the active forms, such as EPA, before your body can use it.
A  2021 meta-analysis  confirms that chia seeds raise blood levels of ALA and EPA in multiple studies.
Having healthy blood sugar levels is crucial for optimal health.
Animal studies  demonstrate that sprouted chia seeds reduce insulin resistance and improve blood sugar control, which are important risk factors for metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.
One human study  found that  bread  made with chia seeds causes a reduced blood sugar response in people without diabetes, compared with more traditional breads.
However, results have been mixed.  One meta-analysis  in overweight subjects found no significant impact of chia seed supplementation on glycemic markers. And a  randomized controlled trial  of people with type 2 diabetes found no significant impact of chia seed on HbA1c, FBG, and insulin levels.
High blood pressure is a major risk factor for chronic diseases such as  heart disease .
Chia seeds have been found in  recent   studies  to lower systolic blood pressure, but did not affect body weight or lipid levels. A  study on chia flour  produced similarly mixed results.
Most people don’t consume enough fiber.
High fiber intake is  linked to   improved gut health  and a lower risk of numerous diseases.
A single ounce (28 grams) of chia seeds provides  9.75 grams  of fiber, which is  35%  of the DV.
Due to their soluble fiber content, chia seeds  slow down  the digestive process, leading to  increased fullness  and decreased food intake.

Adverse effects and individual concerns
Chia seeds are generally considered safe to eat, and few to no adverse effects  have been reported  from consuming them.
However, to avoid possible digestive side effects, drink plenty of water when eating them — especially if they have not been presoaked.

The bottom line
Chia seeds are very rich in  fiber , antioxidants, minerals, and heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids.
They have been linked to improvement in risk factors for heart disease and diabetes, as well as benefits for digestion and gut health.
Chia seeds are very easy to incorporate into a  healthy diet .
