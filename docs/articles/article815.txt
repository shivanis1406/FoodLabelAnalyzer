That said, not all products are created equal.

Naked Energy is not only  certified gluten-free  and vegan but also free of soy, dairy, preservatives, and artificial sweeteners.
Plus, it has been third-party tested by Eurofins Scientific, so you can trust the quality of its ingredients.
Speaking of ingredients, Naked Energy includes 200 mg caffeine, which is equivalent to approximately two 8-ounce (237-mL) cups of coffee.
It also contains beta-alanine and creatine, making the supplement a great choice if you’re looking for a pre-workout to boost your energy levels and help build muscle.
However, it includes L-arginine rather than  L-citrulline , so you likely won’t reap any improved blood flow benefits.
If the unflavored version is too natural for your taste, this supplement also comes in a fruit punch flavor that’s sweetened with pure cane sugar and natural flavors.
Many customers agree that the taste isn’t the best, but its simple, natural ingredients and effectiveness more than make up for it.

With 3 grams of creatine per scoop (10 grams), Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre-Workout is great if you’re looking to  build muscle  and strength in the gym.
One serving also includes beta-alanine and a more modest 175 mg of caffeine to help your muscles work harder and fight fatigue.
Optimum Nutrition’s pre-workout is certified by Informed Choice — a third-party testing organization that specifically tests products for impurities and the presence of substances banned in sports.
It’s worth noting that the supplement includes a proprietary blend called AstraGin, which includes Panax notoginseng extract and Astragalus membranous.
AstraGin  is considered safe for healthy adults, and it’s thought to support the absorption of nutrients in the body and boost energy levels. However, there are currently no studies in humans to confirm these effects.

On the ingredient list, you’ll find L-citrulline for improved blood flow to your muscles during exercise, as well as beta-alanine.

Comparison table of the best pre-workout supplements for women
Quality of ingredients:  Pre-workout supplements are made with high quality, research-backed ingredients.
Third-party testing:  Pre-workout supplements are tested for purity and accuracy by third-party organizations.
User reviews:  Pre-workout supplements have mostly positive customer reviews.
Vetting:  All the products included have been vetted to ensure that they meet Healthline’s medical and business standards.
It’s also important to note that while many of these pre-workout supplements are marketed toward women, the products are not formulated to meet women’s specific nutritional needs.
Therefore, the supplements on this list are appropriate for any healthy adult, regardless of gender.

Common pre-workout supplement ingredients
When looking for a pre-workout supplement, women should consider the specific ingredients, as some have been shown to be more effective than others. Additionally, some ingredients may cause unwanted side effects.
Caffeine:  while it has been shown to improve strength and  athletic performance , some individuals may be more sensitive to caffeine’s  stimulant effects .
Beta-alanine:  an amino acid that  research  suggests may prevent the buildup of acid in muscle tissue, allowing your muscles to work harder. However, beta-alanine can cause a harmless tingling sensation that some individuals dislike.
L-citrulline:  another amino acid, shown to  boost nitric oxide production , which improves blood flow to the muscles. As a result, your muscles can receive  more oxygen  and more nutrients to support muscle performance and growth.
L-arginine:  an amino acid that’s frequently found in pre-workouts, either on its own or with  L-citrulline . L-arginine  has not been found  to benefit exercise performance, as it’s broken down before it reaches the bloodstream.
Creatine:  a substance found in naturally in muscle cells. It has been shown to  improve  both muscle strength and weightlifting performance.
Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs):  a group of three essential amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, and valine. They have been shown to  increase muscle growth  and decrease muscle soreness, though  more research is needed .
Ingredients you may want to look for a pre-workout product include:
caffeine
creatine
beta-alanine
BCAAs
On the other hand, it may be best to avoid some ingredients because of potential side effects or dietary preferences. For example, you may prefer to avoid:
artificial sweeteners
sugar alcohols
excess stimulants such as caffeine

How to choose a pre-workout supplement
Pre-workout supplements may help boost your energy levels and improve your athletic performance. However, not all supplements are created equal. Here are some factors to consider.
Personal fitness goals:  Are you looking to build muscle or hoping to improve endurance? Look for a product that’s formulated to support your exercise goals.
Ingredients:  Read the ingredient list carefully to ensure a product contains research-backed ingredients. Some supplements also include proprietary blends, artificial sweeteners, and other additives, so check for these if you prefer to avoid them.
Allergens:  As some pre-workout supplements contain common allergens such as dairy or gluten, be sure to double-check the ingredient label if you have a food allergy or intolerance.
Quality:   To ensure quality and safety , look for supplements that have been third-party tested, and be cautious of those containing proprietary blends, especially if you’re sensitive to any of the ingredients.
While pre-workouts are considered safe for healthy adults, certain ingredients are not recommended for those who take certain medications or are  pregnant  or breastfeeding.
Therefore, it’s important to speak with a healthcare professional before trying any new supplements.
Finally, given that stimulants affect everyone differently, we recommend starting with a smaller dose of any caffeinated pre-workout supplement to assess your tolerance.

Considerations for using pre-workouts
When considering  pre-workout supplements , it’s crucial to evaluate both your personal health and fitness goals. For those looking to enhance workout performance, ingredients like caffeine and creatine can be effective, but it’s important to start with a lower dose to assess tolerance.
That being said, they can be pretty expensive and can cause  negative side effects  in some individuals.
Some of the ingredients, particularly stimulants and certain  nootropics , are not suitable for pregnant or breastfeeding people, and some may interact with medications. Thus, it’s important to consult with your doctor before starting any new supplements.
If you’re unsure about pre-workout supplements, you can achieve a great performance boost simply by  fueling your workouts  with carbohydrates and protein before and after exercise.
Consuming a well-balanced meal 2 to 3 hours before your workout or eating a lighter top-off snack with  simple carbohydrates  can not only improve performance, but it can also improve body composition.

Frequently asked questions about pre-workout supplements
Pre-workouts are dietary supplements designed to boost energy and performance during a workout. Pre-workouts are typically found in powdered form and can be mixed with water and consumed before a workout.
Most pre-workouts are not formulated to meet male- or female-specific nutritional needs and can be enjoyed by anyone.
For most healthy adults, taking daily pre-workout supplements is likely safe. However, the Food and Drug Administration does not regulate supplements the same way as medications, so it’s best to choose a product that has undergone third-party testing ( 1 ).

Speaking of which, it’s important to note that pre-workouts are not meant to replace a balanced diet.
However, if you want the convenience of a  pre-workout supplement , it’s best to choose a product that has undergone third-party testing to ensure the quality and purity of its ingredients.

Most pre-workout supplements are considered safe for healthy adults, but it’s important to choose products that are third-party tested to help ensure safety and quality. Also, if you drink coffee or other caffeinated beverages, be mindful of your total caffeine intake from these sources in addition to a pre-workout.
Lastly, some individuals, including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding and those who are taking certain medications, should avoid pre-workout supplements
Beginners might consider trying a non-caffeinated pre-workout like Transparent Labs Stim-Free Pre-Workout or Genius Pre first.
If you’re used to caffeine, a pre-workout supplement like the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre-Workout can also be a good first choice. It contains a moderate amount of caffeine (175 mg) to boost energy without overwhelming your system. It also contains other effective ingredients like creatine and beta-alanine to support muscle performance and endurance.
Using pre-workout supplements daily can be safe if you are not exceeding the recommended dosages and are not sensitive to any of the ingredients, especially stimulants like caffeine. It’s important to listen to your body and consider having caffeine-free days to help prevent dependency and tolerance.
Also, if you’re feeling like you need a pre-workout supplement to get through your workout or that you’re constantly lacking energy, something else might be going on. Evaluate things like sleep, hydration, and dietary choices before relying on supplements. You may want to consider talking with a healthcare professional to discuss any concerns you may have.
Pre-workouts might be worth it if you are looking to potentially enhance your athletic performance, increase energy levels, and improve focus during workouts. However, they are definitely not essential, and their effectiveness can vary based on your individual response and product quality.

The bottom line
Depending on the ingredients, a pre-workout supplement can provide a boost to your fitness goals by increasing your energy levels and improving muscle performance and recovery.
However, as there’s a wide variety of pre-workout supplements on the market, it’s important to do your research to find a safe and effective product that meets your fitness needs.
In general, look for a product that’s third-party tested and includes ingredients like L-citrulline, creatine, beta-alanine, and caffeine, depending on your tolerance and preferences.
Most importantly, talk with a healthcare professional before adding a pre-workout supplement to your fitness routine.
