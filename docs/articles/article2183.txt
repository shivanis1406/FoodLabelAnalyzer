Title: Prebiotics vs. Probiotics for Gut Health

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria, and prebiotics are food for these bacteria. Eating foods or supplements containing both can help balance your gut.
Probiotics  and prebiotics are both hot topics in nutrition these days. Yet, even though they sound similar, the two play different roles in health.
We’ll explain what you need to know about the two.

The difference between probiotics and prebiotics
Both prebiotics and probiotics are important for maintaining healthy gut bacteria, collectively referred to as the gut flora or  gut microbiota . However, they have  different roles .
Probiotics  are live bacteria in certain foods or supplements that can provide numerous health benefits to the gut when consumed. Examples of foods that contain probiotics include fermented foods like yogurt and sauerkraut.
Meanwhile,  prebiotics  are high fiber foods that serve as “food” for probiotics,  allowing  them to function properly and effectively. Examples of prebiotic foods are fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

Benefits of probiotics and prebiotics
The  good bacteria  in your digestive tract help protect you from harmful bacteria and fungi. A  2022 research  article on gut bacteria and health confirms that a wide variety of this good type of bacteria can aid in immune system functions and help address obesity, among other benefits.
Another  2019 literature review  suggests that they can also help  improve symptoms of depression  and anxiety.
Additionally, some gut bacteria form vitamin K and short-chain fatty acids, which are the main nutrient source of the cells lining the colon.
They  promote  a strong gut barrier that helps keep out harmful substances, viruses, and bacteria. This also helps reduce inflammation and may reduce the risk of cancer.
Probiotics can help support the composition of bacteria in your gut and may even help increase the amount of beneficial bacteria and decrease the number of harmful ones. Meanwhile, prebiotics can give the probiotics the fuel they need to work.
Probiotics and prebiotics work best in tandem. For probiotics to work best, you need to eat prebiotic foods, too. This  can lead  to improved digestive function and overall health.

How does food affect the gut microbiota?
The food you eat plays an important role in the balance of good and bad gut bacteria.
For example, a high carbohydrate and sugar diet  negatively influences  gut bacteria and may contribute to insulin resistance and  other conditions .
Once you regularly feed the wrong bacteria, they  can grow faster  and colonize more easily without as many helpful bacteria to prevent them from doing so.
Harmful bacteria and less healthy gut flora have also been  associated  with a higher  body mass index (BMI) . Additionally, foods treated with  pesticides  may have  negative effects  on gut bacteria, although more research is needed to confirm this.
However, eating probiotics and prebiotics can help offset these negative effects.
Research  has also shown that antibiotics can permanently change certain types of bacteria, especially when taken during childhood and adolescence.
In particular, it can lead to antimicrobial resistance, which is when microorganisms such as bacteria change in a way that makes them unresponsive to medicines. This can raise the chance of diseases spreading and cause more severe sickness and even death.
For this reason,  researchers  are looking into how probiotics and prebiotics might be able to offset the effect of antibiotics on the gut.

Which foods are prebiotic?
Before you go out and buy expensive  prebiotic supplements , remember that many foods naturally contain them.
That’s because prebiotics are  types of fiber  found in  vegetables ,  fruits , and  legumes .
Foods that are  high in prebiotic fiber  include:
legumes, beans, and peas
oats
bananas
berries
Jerusalem artichokes  (not the same as regular artichokes)
asparagus
dandelion greens
garlic
leeks
onions
One thing your good gut bacteria do with prebiotic fiber is turn it into a short-chain fatty acid called  butyrate .
Research  suggests that butyrate production in the colon cannot be maintained without adequate intake of prebiotic fiber.

Which foods are probiotic?
Many  probiotic foods  naturally contain helpful bacteria, such as  yogurt .
A high quality, plain yogurt with live cultures can be a fantastic addition to your diet if you want to add beneficial bacteria.
Fermented foods  are another great option, as they contain beneficial bacteria that thrive on the naturally occurring sugar or fiber in the food.
Examples of fermented foods include:
sauerkraut
kimchi
kombucha tea
kefir  (dairy and nondairy)
some types of  pickles  (unpasteurized)
other  pickled vegetables  (unpasteurized)
If you’re going to eat fermented foods for their probiotic benefits, make sure they’re not pasteurized, as this process kills the bacteria.
Some of those foods can also be considered  synbiotics  because they contain both beneficial bacteria and a prebiotic source of fiber for the bacteria to feed on.
Some examples of synbiotic foods are cheese, kefir, and sauerkraut.

Should I take probiotic supplements?
Probiotic supplements  are pills, powders, or liquids that contain live beneficial bacteria or yeast. They’re very popular and easy to find, but not all are worth your money.
The right strains of probiotics can be incredibly beneficial for some people. However, the type of strain, product formula, quality of the product, and storage  can affect  how they are absorbed and their beneficial effects on health.
Not all supplements have the same types of bacteria or the same concentrations. Many products on the market  make claims  without proof of efficacy.
Also, they usually don’t contain  prebiotic  sources for the bacteria to eat, which can hinder their effectiveness.
Moreover, many probiotics don’t tolerate stomach acid well, which can reduce their effectiveness. However, this, too, depends on the strain or the combination of strains. If you’re looking for a probiotic supplement, ask your doctor which type is best for you.

Who should not take prebiotics or probiotics?
Generally, it’s accepted that some individuals, such as people with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), shouldn’t consume probiotics or prebiotics, as these may worsen their symptoms.
However, a new  2023 literature review  suggests that some strains of probiotics might actually help improve IBS symptoms. For this reason, if you have IBS, speak with your doctor first to determine if probiotics may help you.
As with all supplements, you may want to consult a healthcare professional knowledgeable about probiotics.

The bottom line
Keeping your gut bacteria balanced is important for many aspects of health.
To do this, eat plenty of both prebiotic and probiotic foods, as they will help promote the most ideal balance between good and bad gut bacteria.
Talk with your healthcare professional to ensure you’re eating the right amounts of each. It’s possible to go overboard or experience  side effects .
To see if you could benefit from a supplement, check out the  World Gastroenterology Organization Global Guidelines  list of evidence-based conditions that probiotics could potentially help. It also includes recommendations.
Please read the labels on any supplements carefully and discuss any questions or recommendations with your healthcare professional.
