Title: 17 Creative Ways to Eat More Vegetables

Elevate your vegetable intake with these 17 creative and nutritious ways to incorporate them into your diet. You won’t even have to worry about compromising the taste of your dish.
Veggies  are rich in nutrients and  antioxidants , which boost your health and help fight off disease. They’re also  beneficial for weight management  due to their low calorie content.
Health authorities worldwide recommend that adults consume  several servings  of vegetables each day, but this can be difficult for some people.
Some find it inconvenient to eat vegetables, while others are simply unsure how to prepare them in an  appetizing way .
We’ll cover some unique ways to incorporate vegetables into your daily meals so that you never get sick of them. And you don’t have to follow this list strictly — enjoy a burger at lunch or tuna salad at dinner.

1–2. Veggie-based breakfast options
Omelets  are a versatile way to add veggies to your meal plan. Plus, eggs add  lots of good nutrients .
Cook up some beaten eggs with a small amount of butter or oil in a pan, and then fold them around a filling that often includes:
cheese
meat
vegetables
a combination of the three
Any veggie tastes great in omelets, and you can really load them up for lots of nutrition. Spinach, onions, scallions,  bok choy , mushrooms, bell peppers, and  tomatoes  are common additions.
Spinach, goat cheese, and chorizo omelet
Moringa omelet
Waffle omelet with tomatoes and peppers
Vegan chickpea omelet
Oats don’t have to be sweet. Savory  oatmeal  can add more veggies to your morning.
While it’s great with fresh fruit, raisins, or  cinnamon , you can also add in:
eggs
spices
lots of veggies
This recipe  for savory oatmeal includes mushrooms and kale for a hearty and warm meal.
We already know kale provides good nutrition, and so do  mushrooms . They’re  high in protein , vitamin D, and vitamin B12, which makes them an especially great addition to a plant-based eating plan.
Banana chia overnight oatmeal
Instant Pot overnight multigrain porridge
Overnight oats with summer fruit

3–4. Veggie-based lunch options
Using  lettuce  as a wrap or certain veggies as buns in place of tortillas and bread is an easy way to eat more veggies.
Lettuce wraps  can be a part of several types of dishes and are often used to make low carb sandwiches and bunless burgers.
Additionally, many types of veggies make excellent buns. Try these bun alternatives:
portobello mushroom caps
sliced sweet potatoes
halved red or yellow peppers
tomato halves
sliced eggplant
Lettuce wraps and veggie buns are an easy way to  reduce your calorie intake , as one lettuce leaf contains only  1 calorie . Refined  white bread hamburger buns , on the other hand, are much higher in calories.
Chickpea taco lettuce wraps
Paleo lettuce wrap
BLT lettuce wrap
Portobello mushroom bruschetta
In general,  tuna  (or  chicken  or  salmon ) salad is made by blending tuna with  mayonnaise , but any chopped vegetable can be added to increase the flavor and nutrient content.
Onions, carrots, cucumber, spinach, and herbs are common additions.  This Mediterranean tuna salad  has:
cucumbers
grape tomatoes
olives
red peppers
artichokes
shallots
parsley
Grown-up tuna salad
Grilled tuna with cucumber salad
Tuna, olive, avocado, and green bean salad

5–13. Veggie-based dinners
Soups  are an excellent way to consume multiple servings of vegetables at once.
You can make veggies the “base” by pureeing them and adding spices, such as in this  broccoli spinach quinoa soup .
Furthermore, it’s simple to cook veggies into broth- or cream-based soups.
Adding even a small number of extra veggies, such as broccoli, to soups is a great way to increase your intake of:
fiber
vitamins
minerals
ribollita
kitchen sink soup
green papaya fish soup
kale, tomato, and white bean soup
pho  packed with spinach and bok choy
Another creative way to eat more veggies is by making  pasta-free  zucchini lasagna.
Traditional lasagna is a pasta-based dish made by layering  noodles with sauce, cheese, and meat. It’s tasty, but it’s also typically  high in carbs  and doesn’t always include  veggies.
A great way to prepare this delicious dish with fewer carbs and more nutrients is to replace the lasagna noodles with strips of zucchini.
Zucchini  is a rich source of:
B vitamins
vitamin C
trace minerals
fiber
Take your favorite lasagna recipe and replace those noodles with strips of zucchini sliced with a vegetable peeler.
Salt the zucchini, let it sit for 15 minutes, and pat it dry with a paper towel to draw out the extra water.
Veggie noodles  are easy to make, and a great way to get more veggies in your eating plan. They’re also an excellent low carb substitute for  high carb foods , such as pasta.
You can make veggie noodles by inserting vegetables into a spiralizer, which creates noodle-like shapes out of them. Spiralizers are commonly used for zucchini,  carrots ,  spaghetti squash , and  sweet potatoes , all of which come packed with extra nutrients.
Other ways to make veggie noodles include:
shredding them
slicing them with a mandoline
cutting them up as you please
Once the “noodles” are made, they can be consumed just like pasta and combined with sauces, other vegetables, or meat.
Spaghetti squash in white wine and mushroom sauce
Zoodles with lentil bolognese
Peanut-chicken zoodles
Cauliflower  is extremely versatile. You can:
rice it
roast it
stick it in a stew
puree it for silky goodness
make it into a pizza crust
Replacing a regular, flour-based pizza crust with a  cauliflower crust  is as easy as combining finely chopped and drained cauliflower with eggs,  almond flour , and some seasonings.
You can then add your own toppings, such as fresh veggies, tomato sauce, and cheese.
A cup (100 grams) of  cauliflower  contains only about 5 grams of carbs and 26 calories, in addition to lots of:
fiber
vitamins
minerals
antioxidants
Vegan cauliflower soup
Deviled cauliflower casserole
Cauliflower green curry
Including extra veggies in casseroles is an efficient way to increase your veggie intake. They add bulk, texture, and taste all at once.
Casseroles often combine meats with:
vegetables
cheese
potatoes
a grain, such as rice or pasta
As you might expect, traditional casseroles are typically very high in  refined carbs  and calories. They’re especially common around  the holidays  when vegetables may be less popular than other dishes.
You can reduce calories and carbs in your casseroles by replacing the grains with veggies, such as:
broccoli
mushrooms
celery
carrots
A  green bean casserole  is particularly familiar and popular.
In addition to good amounts of vitamins and minerals, 1 cup of raw  green beans  contains  33 micrograms (mcg)  of folate, a necessary B vitamin.
Broccoli & Velveeta Ritz casserole
Mixed mushroom casserole
Herbed green bean casserole
Veggie kebabs pack lots of flavor onto a party-ready stick.
To make them, place chopped vegetables of your choice on a skewer and cook on a grill or barbecue. Bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, zucchini, and tomatoes work well for kebabs.
Try these  Cajun-style shrimp and bell pepper kebabs  and layer in all the veggies you want.
Beef and vegetable shish kebabs
Grilled halloumi and vegetable kebabs
Veggie burgers are an easy swap for heavier meat burgers and can be topped with even more vegetables.
Veggie burger patties can be made by combining vegetables with eggs, nuts or nut flours, and seasonings. Sweet potatoes and  black beans  are also commonly used to make veggie burgers.
Note that not all meat-free burgers are full of veggies. Watch the labels to find some that have veggies  as their main ingredients .
You can take these recipes a step further by wrapping your veggie burger in a lettuce wrap instead of a bun.
Stuffed  bell peppers  are made by stuffing halved bell peppers with cooked meat, beans, rice, and seasonings, and then baking them in the oven.
If you like peppers raw and crisp, you can add layers of  cream cheese , sliced chicken or  turkey , and seasonings for a cold dish.
Bell peppers  of any color are a rich source of many vitamins and minerals, especially vitamins A and C.
Including even more extra veggies can increase the nutrition content of stuffed bell peppers. For example, add onions, spinach, or  riced cauliflower  to this  Italian-style stuffed pepper recipe .
Slow-cooker quinoa stuffed peppers
Stuffed bell peppers with feta and herbs
Vegan quinoa stuffed peppers
Meatloaf can also be a vehicle for more vegetables. It’s usually made with a combination of ground meat and other ingredients, such as eggs, breadcrumbs, and tomato sauce. It’s then molded into the shape of a loaf, which is where it gets its name.
You can add just about any chopped vegetable to meatloaf, including:
onions
bell peppers
carrots
zucchini
greens like spinach
Additionally, you can make “meatloaf” that’s completely veggie-based, including chickpeas, carrots, onions, and celery. The chickpeas will replace the meat and still feel hearty.
Mushroom and red wine meatloaf
Spinach meatloaf
Turkey meatloaf with carrots and brown rice

14–17. Veggie-based snacks and sides
Adding extra vegetables to your sauces and dressings is a clever way to increase your veggie intake, especially if you have picky kids.
While you’re cooking sauces, such as marinara sauce, simply add some veggies and herbs of your choice to the mix, such as:
chopped onions
carrots
bell peppers
leafy greens  like  spinach
Pureeing roasted  root vegetables  can make for rich sauces with an Alfredo-like feel. Think:
carrots
sweet potatoes
squash
turnips
purple yam
beets
kohlrabi
Try making  pesto  with roasted beets for the most vibrant dish ever.
Smoothies  make for a refreshing breakfast or snack.  Green smoothies , in particular, are very popular for hiding loads of leafy greens in fruity packages.
Typically, they’re made by combining fruit with ice,  milk , or water in a blender. You can also add veggies to smoothies without compromising the flavor.
Fresh, leafy greens are common smoothie additions, such as in  this recipe , which combines  kale  with  blueberries , bananas, and cucumber.
Just 1 loosely packed cup (25 grams) of  spinach  contains a full day’s recommended amount of vitamin K and 13% of the recommended amount of vitamin A. Cooked spinach will also provide more nutrients per cup.
The same serving of kale also provides high amounts of:
vitamin A
vitamin C
lots of vitamin K
In addition, frozen zucchini,  pumpkin , beets, avocado, and sweet potatoes work well blended into smoothies.
Acai green smoothie
Pineapple, banana, and avocado green smoothie
Guacamole  is an avocado-based dip made by mashing ripe  avocados  and sea salt together with  lemon  or lime juice,  garlic , and additional seasonings. But you don’t have to stop there.
A variety of vegetables tastes great when incorporated into guacamole. Bell peppers, tomatoes, garlic, and onions are good options.
Plus, guacamole makes a delicious topper for  salads  and baked sweet or white potatoes.
This  kale guacamole  recipe uses the good greens as well as  cilantro  and salsa verde.
Try these 26 twists on the classic guacamole.
Cauliflower rice  is made by pulsing cauliflower florets in a food processor into small granules. It can then be used raw or cooked as a substitute for regular rice. It also serves as a base for other foods and bulks up stews and soups.
Cauliflower rice is significantly lower in carbs than regular rice, with only 5 grams of carbs per cup, compared to  53 grams  in a cup of  white rice .
Additionally,  cauliflower  is particularly high in:
vitamin C
vitamin K
folate
potassium
You can also “rice” other vegetables, such as  broccoli , beets, carrots, zucchini, and sweet potatoes.

The takeaway
Vegetables can be added to everyday food items in many ways. Some can sneak right into recipes without a lot of drama (like spinach), and some add color and flavor in ways you’d never expect (like beets and sweet potatoes).
Adding to a dish is great, but sometimes veggies can become the star as your sandwich bun or rice.
Tip: If you don’t like a certain vegetable that you’ve only tried boiled, try roasting it. So many people who hate boiled Brussels sprouts end up loving roasted or  sauteed sprouts .
You’ll significantly increase your intake of fiber, nutrients, and antioxidants by making veggies a regular part of your eating habits.
