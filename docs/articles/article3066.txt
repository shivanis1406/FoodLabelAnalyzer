Why we like it:  Its combination of third-party testing, research-backed dose of  creatine monohydrate , and ease of mixing (with zero taste or aftertaste), earned  Klean Athlete  our top spot.
Klean Creatine contains just one ingredient — creatine monohydrate — and is  NSF Certified for Sport . This is a third-party certification that ensures the product is free of substances that are banned by most competitive sport organizations.
During testing, McGrane noted that the product has zero taste or aftertaste, making it easy to drink on its own or mix into smoothies, shakes, or other pre-workout foods and beverages.
According to McGrane, “Klean Athlete Creatine was one of the easiest to scoop and mix.  Unlike most of the others, the powder stayed mixed for several minutes before starting to settle to the bottom of the glass.”
Just keep in mind that the handle of the scoop is on the shorter side and might be a little awkward to use for people with larger hands.

Why we like it:  Thorne Creatine earns a nod thanks to its affordable price, use of the best creatine monohydrate (in our opinion), and  NSF Certified for Sport  designation.
We like  Thorne Research  as a company because of its focus on producing high quality, sustainably sourced supplements.
It’s also our top pick for the  best creatine for women .
During testing, McGrane liked that the powder was truly flavorless. However, it was one of the hardest to mix, with the powder quickly settling to the bottom after each sip, and it had a slight grittiness. For these reasons, it didn’t quite make our pick as best overall or best unflavored.
However, if you plan on mixing the powder into yogurt or blending it in a smoothie, the high quality of the supplement makes it worth considering.

Best for muscle growth
Form   powder
Certifications   third-party tested for purity and potency
Price   $$$
Why we like it:  Containing both creatine and beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), this powder from Transparent Labs is our pick for the best creatine for muscle growth.
While more research is needed, a  2017 study  showed that HMB may help  build muscle mass  and increase strength when paired with resistance training.
During testing, McGrane found the Blue Raspberry and Black Cherry flavors easy to mix and refreshing to drink. Just keep in mind that these powders have a strong stevia taste and aftertaste, which may be a dealbreaker for some.
McGrane also tested the unflavored product and wasn’t a fan. “Based on this round of testing, the unflavored version wouldn’t be my top pick. It had an unpleasant metallic taste and aftertaste. It also didn’t mix as easily as the company’s flavored options.”
All products from Transparent Labs are third-party tested by  Analytical Resource Laboratories . On its website, the company offers a certificate of analysis (COA) for each supplement, which provides information on the quality, strength, and specifications of a product.
Finally, keep in mind that this product contains vitamin D and may not be appropriate if you’re already taking a vitamin D supplement.

Why we like it:  Offering the convenience and ease of pills over powders, these creatine capsules from Optimum Nutrition contain approximately 2.5 grams (g) of pure micronized creatine per serving.
“Micronized” means the creatine particles have been mechanically processed to make them smaller, enhancing their solubility and absorption when consumed. This form also ensures the capsules contain no calories or carbohydrates.
All Optimum Nutrition supplements are tested in-house for banned substances and manufactured in CGMP-certified facilities.
During testing, McGrane noted that the size of the capsules was intimidating, but they were relatively easy to swallow and didn’t leave any bad aftertaste.
Optimum Nutrition creatine capsules are sold in three bottle sizes: 100-, 200- and 300-count.

Why we like it:  This value creatine powder from Nutricost delivers 5 g of non-GMO creatine monohydrate per serving and is free of artificial additives, fillers, or preservatives. It’s also easy to mix and comes in both flavored and unflavored varieties.
While it carries fewer certifications, it’s still third-party tested at a lab accredited by the  International Organization for Standardization (ISO) .
McGrane tested the Unflavored version, which she found to have one of the smoothest consistencies after mixing.
“ Nutricost’s creatine was one of the easiest to mix, and the powder didn’t settle to the bottom as quickly as Thorne or Naked Nutrition’s powders.
“The consistency of the powder (before mixing) is similar to cornstarch and was a bit harder and messier to scoop than many of the others I tried. The scoop is also quite long, which, combined with how dense the powder is, made it hard to screw the lid back on.
“Those minor cons aside, given the affordable price point, this is a pretty impressive product.”

Why we like it:  Naked Nutrition prides itself on producing quality supplements with just a few ingredients. It’s also one of the few creatine products on the market that’s certified vegan.
According to McGrane, “ I found this product to be very similar to Thorne’s creatine in that it needs to be stirred the whole time you’re drinking it.
“There was a slight grittiness, which I probably wouldn’t have noticed if I wasn’t directly comparing it with Nutricost or Klean Athlete’s creatine powders.
“Out of all the powders I tried, this one was the hardest to open, though that’s probably because I have small hands, and the lid is quite large. But even closing the lid was a bit awkward because it kept getting off track and wouldn’t screw on smoothly.”
While there were some downsides, McGrane said she would still recommend it for people who follow a vegan diet or need a certified gluten-free option.

Why we like it:  Out of all the powders we tested, Kaged Creatine HCL was the only one that fully dissolved in water. In addition to being easy to mix, it’s third-party certified by  Informed Sport , making it a good option for competitive athletes.
The powder also comes in two flavored varieties plus an unflavored option, though McGrane noted that the unflavored powder isn’t actually flavorless.
“ While it’s supposed to be unflavored, there is an acidic flavor, almost like you had squeezed a little lemon juice into your drink. I personally like lemon water, so it wasn’t a problem for me, but it was noticeable.”
The powder also stands out because it’s the only option on our list that contains creatine hydrochloride instead of monohydrate.
Creatine monohydrate has been widely studied and is considered the most  effective  form of creatine. But another form,  creatine hydrochloride , shows promise as being both effective and possibly easier to digest due to its absorbability.

What to look for

The best creatine supplements compared
Note: “Certified safe for sport” refers to certifications offered by NSF and Informed Sport, two companies that ensure products are free of substances banned by most competitive sports organizations.
Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the products on this page, we considered all the creatine supplements that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further.

How we tested
All of the powders on our list were selected by registered dietitians and passed our extensive vetting process.
Criteria we looked for include:
Quality:  We included products that are made from quality ingredients and contain few or no additives, fillers, or artificial colors or flavors.
Transparency:  We chose products that adhere to health claims and labeling requirements per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. All products are manufactured in facilities that adhere to CGMPs established by the FDA.
Credibility:  We  vetted  all products to ensure they are produced by medically credible companies that follow ethical, legal, and industry best standards.
Third-party testing:  With the exception of Optimum Nutrition capsules (which are produced in a third-party certified facility), we chose products that are third-party tested for purity and safety. Some products are also certified for sport.
Dose:  We looked for products that provide doses appropriate for sports performance based on current research.
Products that passed this extensive review process were then tested by Healthline contributor and registered dietitian  Kelli McGrane . An additional product, which didn’t make our list, was tested by Healthline contributor Laramy Applekamp.
For a fair comparison, all powders were mixed with water in a glass and stirred with a spoon. The amount of water used varied from 6 to 12 ounces (177 to 355 milliliters), depending on each manufacturer’s directions.
I’m ready to get back into strength training after having two kids over the past 3 years. Between work, kids, cooking, and everything else that goes into being an adult, finding time to exercise just hasn’t been high on my priority list.
As a result, I’ve noticed a drastic reduction in strength and muscle mass. I’m curious to try creatine to see if it might be helpful for increasing my lean mass as I start to ramp up my workouts again.

What are the benefits of creatine?
Creatine is commonly known to enhance  athletic performance , and its benefits may extend  beyond fitness  as well.
Research has  found  that  creatine supplements  may help:
Increase strength and muscle growth:  Creatine supplementation  can promote  muscle growth and increase strength, especially when combined with resistance training.
Reduce muscle damage:  Creatine may help reduce muscle damage and inflammation, speeding up the recovery process after intense workouts.
Support brain health:  Some  research  indicates that it can help reduce the impact of concussion and traumatic brain injury.
Regulate blood sugar:  Creatine may  support  healthy blood sugar levels when combined with exercise.
Improve performance in high intensity exercise:  Creatine can increase phosphocreatine levels, a compound your body uses to form adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Your body breaks down ATP for energy. For this reason, people typically use creatine supplements for  high intensity exercise .
Discover more potential  health and performance benefits of creatine .

How to use creatine supplements
The recommended dosage is 3 to 5 g of creatine per day for most individuals. This is the dose that has been shown to maintain creatine levels in the muscles for performance and recovery benefits.
Some individuals might opt for a  loading phase  to quickly saturate the muscles with creatine. This involves taking a higher dose of creatine, typically  20 to 25 g per day , for 5 to 7 days, followed by a consistent daily dose of 3 to 5 g per day.
While the loading phase will help saturate the muscles more quickly, it’s unnecessary. Sticking with the recommended 3 to 5 g daily will lead to the same result and benefit, though it may take longer.
The best time to take creatine is still up for debate. Many manufacturers recommend taking it immediately before or after your workout. However, consistent use seems to be more important than the exact  timing .

Who might benefit from creatine supplements?
Several groups of individuals may especially benefit from using creatine supplements. These include:
Fitness enthusiasts:   Creatine may be effective in supporting the goals of people looking to increase muscle strength and enhance  athletic performance .
Older adults:  Research suggests that creatine supplements may also be beneficial for  brain health  in older adults, plus it can help prevent  muscle loss  with aging.
Women:   Women  may see improvements in muscle strength and recovery, as well as  bone health , when supplementing with creatine. It may also be beneficial for mood and cognitive function in women. However, studies on creatine use in women are limited, and more research is needed.
People with certain conditions:  While more research is needed, creatine may benefit individuals with certain chronic conditions, such as  Parkinson’s disease .

Who should not take creatine supplements?
While creatine is generally considered safe for most people, certain groups should exercise caution or avoid taking it, such as:
Pregnant or breastfeeding people:  There is limited research on the safety of creatine during  pregnancy  and  breastfeeding , so it’s best to avoid it unless recommended by a healthcare professional.
Individuals with kidney or liver disease:  While research has  dispelled  the myth that creatine puts too much strain on the kidneys and liver in healthy individuals, it is best to use caution and work with your doctor if you have a history of liver or kidney concerns.  People taking certain medications:  Creatine can interact with some medications. For example, because creatine can help improve  blood sugar levels , those taking medication to help manage blood sugar should use caution to avoid low blood sugar. It’s a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional before starting creatine if you take any medications.

Potential risks and side effects
One of  creatine’s most commonly reported  side effects  is a short-term increase in fluid retention, which may result from creatine’s osmotic properties.
Creatine supplementation has also been consistently associated with weight gain, especially during the loading phase. This is typically due to increases in muscle mass and water retention rather than an increase in body fat.
Some other anecdotal side effects often reported with creatine supplementation are:
digestive issues
dehydration
muscle cramps
kidney or liver problems
However, according to the  2017 position paper  on creatine by the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN), there is no compelling scientific evidence that the short-term or long-term use of creatine monohydrate (up to 30 g/day for 5 years) has any harmful effects on healthy individuals.
Additionally, the ISSN notes that both short- and long-term supplementation with creatine is considered safe and effective for improving exercise performance and preventing or reducing the severity of injuries.
