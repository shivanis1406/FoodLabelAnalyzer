Title: Uses and Benefits of Sea Moss

Sea moss, also known as Irish sea moss or red seaweed, is a marine vegetable similar to seaweed and sea algae. It contains minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants and may have health benefits.
Sea moss, also known as Irish sea moss or red seaweed, is a spiny sea vegetable primarily harvested for health supplements and as a thickening ingredient in commercial foods.
If you’ve heard about sea moss supplements, you may wonder how you could use them and whether there are other ways to consume sea moss.
This article examines sea moss’s potential benefits and downsides, including its nutritional content and how to prepare it.

What is sea moss?
Sea moss, scientifically known as Chondrus crispus, is a type of algae or seaweed. It grows in waters along the rocky Atlantic coasts, primarily between North America and Europe.
It’s an edible sea plant similar to other  seaweeds , algae, and other familiar leafy sea vegetables like  kelp  or dulse.
Sea moss grows in several colors, such as shades of green, yellow, purple, red, brown, and black.
The most common varieties that grow in the warmer waters are generally red and often called Irish moss.

Sea moss nutrients
Red seaweeds, like sea moss, contain various vitamins and minerals. They’re naturally low in calories, fat, and sugar and contain a small amount of plant protein.
A  4-tablespoon (20-gram)  serving of raw Irish sea moss provides the following:
Calories:  10
Protein:  0.5 grams
Total fat:  0 grams
Total carbs:  3 grams
Fiber:  0.5 grams
Total sugar:  0 grams
Calcium:  1% of the Daily Value (DV)
Iron:  10% of the DV
Magnesium:  7% of the DV
Phosphorus:  2% of the DV
Zinc:  4% of the DV
Copper:  3% of the DV
Like other sea vegetables, sea moss is also a naturally good source of iodine, a micronutrient necessary for thyroid health.
Additionally, red seaweeds like sea moss are full of  antioxidants , which are compounds that help protect your cells from disease-causing oxidative damage.

What does sea moss do for your body?
Today, sea moss is mainly used as a source of vitamins and minerals to benefit overall health.
You can most commonly find it in supplement form. Some supplement companies sell it in raw form, as a gel or powder, or as an oral capsule or gummy.
Companies also sell sea moss as a component of supplements combined with turmeric,  bladderwrack , and burdock root, claiming this combination benefits overall well-being, primarily:
immunity
thyroid health
the digestive system
joint health
Sea moss has a long history of use as a food-thickening agent. It’s the only natural source of  carrageenan , a thickener that manufacturers use in foods like:
ice cream
cottage cheese
some nondairy milks
baby formula

What are the potential benefits of sea moss?
Many people use sea moss for its purported health benefits. But, it’s important to note that many of the benefits of sea moss specifically are anecdotal and lack solid scientific evidence.
There are more studies on the health benefits of seaweed and algae than on sea moss itself. Still, some of these benefits may also apply to sea moss because they grow in similar environments.
However, scientists need to conduct more research on sea moss to investigate its particular effects.
Some of the main potential benefits of using sea moss may include:
May support thyroid health:  Seaweeds are  rich  in iodine, a micronutrient necessary for healthy thyroid function.
May support immunity:  One  study  in salmon found that supplemental seaweed improved immune modulation and response. Scientists need to do more research to see whether it also supports immunity in humans.
May improve gut health:  Seaweeds are a  good source of live probiotic bacteria  and fiber, which both support a  healthy gut microbiome .
May help support weight loss:  Seaweeds and microalgae contain dietary fiber that can help you feel full and prevent overeating. Some research suggests a compound in seaweed called  fucoxanthin  may have anti-obesity effects.
May promote heart health:  Some  studies  have found that components in seaweed help reduce cholesterol and blood pressure, which may help reduce the risk of heart disease.
May improve blood sugar management:  One  study in mice  found that the compound fucoxanthin in seaweed reduced high blood sugar.
Anecdotal benefits for fertility:  There’s no scientific evidence that sea moss promotes fertility. However, some people use it as a  traditional fertility treatment . Scientists need to investigate this further.
While the potential health benefits of sea moss are promising, it’s important to note that most of the research is based on seaweed or components found in marine plants, not sea moss specifically. The studies were also conducted in test tubes or animals, not in humans.
Therefore, scientists need to do much more human research on the health effects of sea moss.

What are the downsides of sea moss?
One of the main potential downsides of sea moss is that researchers have conducted little research on its benefits and nutritional makeup.
As with seaweed, the nutritional value of sea moss can vary greatly, making it difficult to know exactly what it contains and in what amounts. Much of the  micronutrient and fatty acid  contents of sea vegetables depend on the environment in which they grow.
While it’s a good source of iodine, the iodine content of sea moss and other seaweeds is highly variable. This can put consumers at risk of  overconsumption of iodine , which could be problematic.
Taking in too much iodine can lead to  hypothyroidism , or underactive thyroid. The thyroid is an important gland located in the lower front of your neck. It’s responsible for growth and metabolism.
Sea moss may also come with a risk of heavy metal consumption, as seaweed absorbs and stores heavy metals in high amounts.
Still, the risk of toxicity appears to be low. One  study  examined the levels of 20 heavy metals in 8 types of seaweed from the waters around Europe and Asia. The researchers found that heavy metals did not pose serious health risks.
It’s probably best to consume sea moss in moderation due to these unknowns.
Sea moss, especially in large quantities, may cause side effects and may not be safe for some people. This can include people with hypothyroidism.
While allergies to seaweed and sea moss are uncommon, it is still possible to develop an allergy to sea moss. If you have any symptoms of an allergy, including itchiness or hives, you may need medical attention. Some severe allergy symptoms, such as throat swelling or difficulty breathing, require emergency medical attention.

How to prepare sea moss
You can prepare sea moss in several ways.
Many health food stores and online retailers sell sea moss in raw, dried form. You can prepare a gel from this at home. This may be one of the most popular ways to consume it.
To prepare a sea moss gel, soak raw sea moss in water overnight, then rinse and blend it with new water until smooth. Transfer it to a container with an airtight lid and store it in the refrigerator overnight to gel.
Some supplement companies also offer sea moss already prepared as a gel. According to the manufacturers, you can consume this form directly or add it to food and drinks.
Other ways to consume sea moss include mixing sea moss powder into beverages, sprinkling it over  yogurt  or  oatmeal , and adding it to different meals.
The shelf life of sea moss depends on the form in which you purchased it.
While scientific evidence is lacking, many sea moss advocates say that prepared sea moss gel should last a few weeks in the fridge. You can also freeze it.
However, as with most prepared foods and cold-storage leftovers, it’s probably best to practice caution and only keep them for  3 to 5 days  to minimize the risk of foodborne illnesses.

The bottom line
Sea moss, or Chondrus crispus, is a spiny sea vegetable similar to seaweeds and sea algae.
People harvest it for its carrageenan. Companies also use it as a natural thickening agent in commercial foods and consumer health supplements. You can also use it to make a gel at home or easily add it to foods and beverages.
Sea moss is a source of various vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that may benefit overall health. However, its nutritional composition can vary, and by consuming it in large amounts, you may consume high levels of iodine or heavy metals.
Overall, scientists need to research the health effects of sea moss on humans to determine its efficacy in consumer health products. Still, some of the benefits appear promising based on studies of seaweed and sea algae.
