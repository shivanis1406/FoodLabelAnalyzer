Title: 11 Evidence-Based Health Benefits of Bananas

Bananas  are native to Southeast Asia but now grow in many warm climates around the world.
They’re an excellent choice if you’re interested in adding more  healthy fruits  to your diet.
Bananas contain  fiber  and many beneficial nutrients, including:
potassium
vitamin B6
vitamin C
various  antioxidants  and  phytonutrients

Benefits
Here are 11 science-based health benefits of bananas.

1. Rich in nutrients
Bananas contain a fair amount of  carbs , water, fiber, and antioxidants but little  protein  and no  fat .
One  medium banana  contains:
Calories:  112
Fat:  0 grams (g)
Protein:  1 g
Carbs:  29 g
Fiber:  3 g
Vitamin C:  12% of the Daily Value (DV)
Riboflavin:  7% of the DV
Folate:  6% of the DV
Niacin:  5% of the DV
Copper:  11% of the DV
Potassium:  10% of the DV
Magnesium:  8% of the DV

2. May improve blood sugar levels
Bananas are rich in  soluble fiber . During digestion, soluble fiber dissolves in liquid to form a gel. This may also contribute to a banana’s  sponge-like texture .
Unripe (green)  bananas also contain  resistant starch , a type of fiber that your body does not digest.
Together, these two types of fiber may help  moderate your blood sugar levels  after meals and regulate your appetite by  slowing the emptying of your stomach .
This means that despite their higher carb content, bananas may not cause major spikes in blood sugar levels in people who don’t have diabetes.
However, for those who have  diabetes , eating a large portion in one sitting may cause blood sugar levels to rise too high, so it’s best to stick to one banana at a time.

3. May support digestive health
Dietary fiber has been linked to many  health benefits , including improved digestion.
Resistant starch, the type of fiber found in unripe bananas, is a prebiotic. Prebiotics  escape digestion  and end up in your large intestine, where they become food for the  beneficial bacteria  in your gut (probiotics).
What’s more,  pectin  — a fiber found in both ripe and unripe bananas — may help prevent  constipation  and soften stools.
Some test-tube studies even suggest that pectin may  help protect against colon cancer , although further research in humans is needed to learn more about this possible benefit.

4. May aid weight loss
No study has directly investigated the effects of bananas on weight loss. However, bananas have several attributes that could make them a  weight-loss-friendly food .
Bananas have relatively few calories — just over 100 calories in an average banana — but are nutritious and filling.
They’re also packed with dietary fiber and resistant starch, which may  help you feel full longer  and therefore reduce the frequency and size of your meals.
If you’d like to include unripe bananas in your diet, try using them as you’d use  plantains .

5. May support heart health
Potassium is a mineral that’s vital for heart health and especially for blood pressure management. However, few people get  enough potassium  in their diet.
Bananas are a great source of potassium, with a medium banana providing 10% of the DV.
A potassium-rich diet could help  lower your blood pressure , reducing your risk of  hypertension . A 2017 study in mice also suggests that potassium may lower the risk of heart disease by  27% .
Additionally, bananas contain 8% of the DV for  magnesium , another  important mineral for heart health .
Magnesium deficiency  (hypomagnesemia) may be linked to an increased risk of heart disease, elevated blood pressure, and high levels of fats in the blood. Therefore, it’s essential to get enough of this mineral from either your diet or  supplements .

6. Full of antioxidants
Fruits and vegetables are  excellent sources  of dietary antioxidants, and bananas are no exception.
They contain several types of  potent antioxidants , including  flavonoids  and amines. These antioxidants are linked to many health benefits, such as a reduced risk of heart disease and  macular degeneration .
Antioxidants help prevent  oxidative damage  to your cells caused by free radicals. If you do not consume enough antioxidants, free radicals can build up over time and cause harm if their levels become high enough in your body.

7. May help you feel fuller
The soluble fiber in bananas may help keep you full by adding bulk to your digestive system and slowing digestion.
Additionally, bananas are relatively low in calories for their size.
Combined, the low calorie and high fiber content of bananas make them  a more filling snack  than some other options, such as  processed  or sugary boxed snacks.
Protein is filling, but bananas are low in this  macronutrient . For a hunger-reducing snack, you can try eating a sliced banana with a protein-rich food such as  Greek yogurt  or blending a banana into a  protein shake .

8. May improve insulin sensitivity when unripe
Insulin resistance  is a significant risk factor in several chronic diseases, including  type 2 diabetes .
Studies suggest that regularly eating resistant starch may  improve insulin sensitivity , making your body more responsive to the blood sugar-regulating hormone insulin.
But more research is needed to investigate how the resistant starch in bananas might affect insulin sensitivity.

9. May improve kidney health
Potassium is vital for healthy kidney function and blood pressure regulation.
As a great dietary source of potassium, bananas could be especially beneficial for keeping your  kidneys healthy .
A  2019 study  that included more than 5,000 people with early stage chronic kidney disease linked potassium with lower blood pressure and a slower progression of kidney disease.
However, some people who have  late stage kidney disease  or are undergoing  dialysis  need to restrict their potassium intake. If you fall into one of these categories, speak with a healthcare professional before increasing your potassium intake.

10. May support exercise recovery
Bananas are sometimes referred to as the perfect food for athletes. This is largely due to their content of easily digested carbs along with potassium and magnesium, which  act as electrolytes .
You lose  electrolytes  through your sweat during vigorous exercise. Resupplying your body with potassium and magnesium after sweating may reduce exercise-related muscle cramps and  soreness .
Specific research on the effects of bananas on exercise performance, cramping, and exercise recovery is lacking. But bananas can provide excellent nutrition before, during, and  after exercise .

11. Easy to add to your diet
Bananas are not only healthy and tasty but also convenient.
They make a great addition to yogurt, cereal, or smoothies, and they work well as a topping for whole grain toast with peanut butter. You can even use them in place of sugar in your baking and cooking.
Bananas are also easy to transport and are usually well tolerated and easily digested. All you need to do is peel them and you’re good to go.
You can make easy, delicious pancakes by making a banana batter. Combine one mashed banana with two beaten eggs, and then cook the mixture as you would any other pancake batter. Add some quick oats to the batter for extra fiber and bulk.
If you freeze banana slices, you can use a high powered blender to blend them with cocoa powder to make chocolate “nice cream.”
For baked oatmeal muffins, combine overripe bananas with:
unsweetened applesauce
oats
milk
baking powder
a sweetener such as agave nectar or maple syrup
Once the ingredients are mixed, pour the batter into a muffin tin and pop it into the oven.
