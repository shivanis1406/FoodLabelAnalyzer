Title: 6 Health Benefits of Manuka Honey, Based on Science

With its potent antibacterial properties, people traditionally use Manuka honey for wound healing, soothing sore throats, preventing tooth decay, and improving digestive issues.
Manuka honey is a honey native to New Zealand. It’s produced by bees that pollinate the flower Leptospermum scoparium (L.scoparium), commonly known as the Manuka bush.
Manuka honey’s antibacterial properties are what set it apart from traditional honey. It contains methylglyoxal as an active ingredient, likely responsible for these  antibacterial effects . Additionally, Manuka honey has antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant  benefits .
Here are six science-based health benefits of Manuka honey.

1. Aids wound healing
Since ancient times, honey has been used to treat wounds, burns, sores, and boils.
Honey offers antibacterial and antioxidant properties, all while maintaining a moist wound environment and protective barrier, which  prevents microbial infections  in the wound.
Studies have shown that Manuka honey  can enhance wound healing , amplify tissue regeneration, and even decrease pain in people with burns. What’s more, Manuka honey may help heal diabetic ulcers.
Manuka honey may also  effectively treat  wound infections caused by antibiotic-resistant strains, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
Nevertheless, Manuka honey should not replace the use of antibiotics without further research to confirm its effectiveness. Consult a healthcare professional before trying any complementary treatments.

2. May promote oral health
Studies have shown Manuka honey attacks harmful oral bacteria associated with plaque formation, gum inflammation, and tooth decay.
Specifically,  research  has shown that Manuka honey, with its high antibacterial activity, effectively inhibits the growth of harmful oral bacteria like Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans).

3. May help calm a cough
Manuka honey may relieve coughs due to  upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) . URIs are  common infections  caused by bacteria or viruses. They include the common cold, acute bronchitis, influenza, and respiratory distress syndromes.
Symptoms of URIs include cough, sore throat, runny nose, and nasal congestion. Since viruses cause most URIs, antibiotics are ineffective as a treatment and can have harmful side effects.
A number of  studies  suggest honey may be a safe, effective treatment for cough due to URIs. These studies also indicate that honey may be more effective than commonly used medications for relieving URI symptoms, especially cough frequency and severity.
However, you should always follow your doctor’s advice and consult them before trying any complementary treatments.

4. May help prevent gastric ulcers
Stomach ulcers  are one of the most common conditions affecting humans. These sores form on the stomach lining, causing stomach pain, nausea, and bloating.
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a common type of bacteria that’s responsible for the majority of gastric ulcers.  Research  suggests Manuka honey may help treat gastric ulcers caused by this bacteria.
One study  examined whether dietary factors influenced the presence and spread of H. pylori in 294 individuals between 18 and 69 years old. It found that people who consumed honey more than 5 days a week had a significantly lower risk of H. pylori infection than those who didn’t consume honey regularly.
Moreover, those who consumed honey regularly were significantly less likely to have infections associated with specific strains of H. pylori that increase the incidence of diseases like peptic ulcers and gastric cancer.

5. May improve digestive symptoms
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)  is an inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. IBDs, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s can lead to symptoms like:
diarrhea
abdominal pain
nausea
vomiting
Rodent studies  have shown that regularly consuming Manuka honey may help control strains of C.diff, a type of bacteria that  causes severe diarrhea  and inflammation of the bowel.

6. May help treat symptoms of cystic fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder that damages the lungs and can also affect the digestive system and other organs. It affects the cells that produce mucus, causing mucus to be abnormally thick and sticky. This thick mucus clogs airways and ducts, making it difficult to breathe.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Burkholderia cepacia complex (B. cepacia) are two common bacteria that can cause serious upper respiratory infections, especially in vulnerable populations.
One test-tube study  found that Manuka honey inhibited the growth of these bacteria when combined with antibiotics.
Researchers concluded that Manuka honey might be important in treating upper respiratory infections, especially in those with cystic fibrosis.

Is Manuka honey safe?
For most people, Manuka honey is safe to consume.
However, some people should consult a doctor before using it, including:
People with diabetes:  All types of honey are high in natural sugar. So consuming Manuka honey may affect blood sugar levels.
Those allergic to honey or bees:  Those allergic to other types of honey or bees may have an allergic reaction after ingesting or applying Manuka honey.
Infants:  The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  advises against giving honey to children younger than 12 months old due to the risk of  botulism , a type of foodborne illness.

Frequently asked questions
Manuka honey has antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. It may benefit wound healing, cough relief, ulcer healing, digestion, and oral health.
Many cultures have used Manuka honey for wound healing for centuries.
Manuka honey is a type of honey that contains methylglyoxal, which likely gives it its antibacterial effect. It comes from bees that pollinate the New Zealand Manuka bush. Other types of honey are named after the plants that the bees pollinate, such as buckwheat honey, clover honey, and orange blossom honey.
Eating small amounts of Manuka honey daily will typically have no negative health impacts. However, honey still contains high levels of natural sugar, so moderation is key, especially for people with diabetes.
Manuka honey is not suitable for infants, people with blood-sugar control disorders, and those with a honey allergy. As it’s high in natural sugars, people who need to monitor their blood sugar levels should consume it in moderation, or should consult a healthcare professional first.

The bottom line
Manuka honey’s unique antibacterial properties make it a valuable topical treatment for wounds. It speeds wound healing and helps prevent and fight infections, including those caused by antibiotic-resistant strains.
Manuka honey may also help prevent or treat numerous ailments, including IBD, gastric ulcers, periodontal disease, and coughs due to URTIs.
More research, especially in humans, is needed to fully understand Manuka honey’s beneficial properties. But Manuka honey is a generally safe treatment strategy that may speed healing when you use it along with more conventional therapies.
