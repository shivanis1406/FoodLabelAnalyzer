Healthline’s nutrition editor, Kelli McGrane, reviewed Green Chef from her expert perspective as a registered dietitian  and  a busy mom of two. “Green Chef does a really great job of providing nutritionally-balanced meals that are flavorful and enjoyable to eat.  The meals were bursting with various textures and ingredients. The flavors were really tasty and different than what we typically cook at home.”
For those who may be wondering what kind of cooking skills are needed, Kelli has this to offer: “Some take a bit more cooking skills than others, though none of the recipes require fancy cooking equipment.”

Meal type   gluten-free

Why we like it:  Home Chef is a great option for multi-person households and individuals alike who are following a gluten-free diet. The company’s Gluten-Smart meals are made with gluten-free ingredients.
While standard menu items come in 2 to 8 servings, Home Chef has a Family Plan, where you have the option of selecting 4, 8, or 12 servings for each meal. This includes easy-to-make meals with family-friendly flavors. It’s a great option if you’re looking for easy gluten-free dinners for the whole family.

For busy households, there are also Fast & Fresh Family and Oven-Ready Family meals that have microwave- and oven-ready meals.

How it works:  Home Chef recommends meals based on your taste preferences. You can also take a DIY approach and select your own gluten-free meal kits based on filters.

To choose gluten-free meal kits, simply add a gluten-free filter or include this in your preferences.
You can also filter meal kits based on allergens and preferred animal products. For example, you can choose gluten-free plus nut-free or pork-free meals.
Meals are selected each week, with more than 20 recipes to choose from. This is helpful if your household has gluten-free plus other dietary preferences.

SaVanna Shoemaker  is a registered dietitian and busy mom who had this to say after testing Home Chef: “Home Chef is reasonably priced and they have a lot of quick meals that only require a few minutes of prep time. I had a good experience with Home Chef. The ingredients arrive packaged by recipe in plastic bags, which is really convenient when you’re getting ready to cook dinner. The meals were both really tasty and came together very easily, with helpful and straightforward recipe cards.”
“The meals were simple with sauces that added lots of flavor. They also offer a lot of add on salads and sides to stretch the meals further.”
While SaVanna enjoyed the meals, she found they could be more family focused: “I thought Home Chef needed a few more kid-friendly options.”

Why we like it:  Trifecta Nutrition’s “deep chilled” prepared meals are a popular choice among health-conscious consumers, and for good reason. The nutritionally balanced, made-with-sustainable-ingredient meals are tasty, and there’s enough variety in the rotating menu that they don’t feel repetitive. Most meals are also gluten-free, and while they aren’t prepared in a gluten-free kitchen, Trifecta notes that preparation areas are cleaned thoroughly to prevent  cross-contamination .
Trifecta also uses high quality, mostly  organic  ingredients and sustainably sourced proteins.
How it works:  Trifecta Nutrition offers meal plans tailored to several specific diets, including:
Clean:  includes meat or fish, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables
Keto:  includes meat or fish, dairy products, healthy fats, and low carb fruits and vegetables
Paleo:  includes meat or fish, fruits, and vegetables
High Protein Vegan:  includes legumes, tofu, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables
High Protein Vegetarian:  includes legumes, tofu, eggs, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables
Whole30:  includes meat or fish, fruits, and vegetables
It also offers a Classic plan, which allows you to choose your meals to create a custom menu, and a Meal Prep plan, which allows you to order a variety of proteins, carbs, and vegetables.
After choosing your plan, you can order 5, 7, 10, or 14 entrees per week. Boxes containing the upcoming week’s meals are typically delivered on Friday. You can skip future deliveries or customize your delivery schedule to receive meals every other week, every 3 weeks, or once a month.

Registered dietitian  Rachael Ajmera  tried Trifecta and gave the meals good marks for their range of ingredients, as well as the impressive tastes and textures, which did not diminish with reheating.
“I found that the meals had enough variety and featured diverse ingredients, which helped ensure that they didn’t feel boring or repetitive throughout the week.”
“I [also]  found that most ingredients maintained their taste and texture very well even after reheating, which can be a common issue with prepared meals.”

Best plant-based
Price per serving   $6.79 to $9.79
Meal type   prepared meals
Why we like it:  All Daily Harvest  plant-based prepared meals  are gluten-free, and they’re relatively inexpensive compared with other meal delivery services. We also like that you can order breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack options.
How it works:  Unlike other meal delivery services, Daily Harvest doesn’t have specific menus to choose from. Instead, you select how many items you’d like to receive weekly, and then choose from a full menu of options, including breakfast bowls, smoothies, soups, Harvest bowls, flatbreads, and snacks.
Order boxes are delivered weekly, and all products are frozen and packaged with dry ice. You can reheat items like soups and bowls in the microwave or on the stove. You may want to heat the flatbreads in either a traditional oven or a toaster oven.
It’s important to note that although all Daily Harvest meals are gluten-free recipes, they’re prepared in a facility that also processes gluten-containing ingredients, cross-contamination is possible.

Registered dietitian Rachael Ajmera tried Daily Harvest and had a positive experience. “I sampled several entrees, breakfast dishes, snacks, and smoothies from Daily Harvest, all of which I found were tasty, convenient, and easy to prepare.
That said, she was somewhat underwhelmed by the portion sizes. “The portion sizes were small and not very filling. Therefore, I would recommend using it alongside other meals or snacks to help round out your diet.”

Best meal kit

Meal type   meal kits and prepared meals
Why we like it:  Sunbasket is an  organic meal delivery service  that offers a broad assortment of flavorful and easy-to-prepare gluten-free meal kits packed with fresh ingredients. You can also order from the service’s prepared meals menu.
How it works:  Order two or more 2- or 4-serving meals per week (a minimum order is 4 servings) from a specific menu, such as gluten-free, or mix and match for a selection from all the available menus. You can also choose a mix of meal kits and prepared meals for your order.
Order boxes are shipped weekly, and contain pre-measured ingredients for meal kits, along with a recipe booklet. While most items are included in the kit, you’ll want to have things like olive oil, salt and pepper, and basic pans and utensils to prepare the meals.
Prepared meals can be stored in the refrigerator until ready to eat, or then frozen.
It’s important to note that Sunbasket’s gluten-free menu items are packaged in a facility that processes food allergens, including gluten, so are unsuitable for those with severe  gluten-related disorders , such as celiac disease.
Read our full review of Sunbasket.

Our in-house dietitian, Kelli McGrane, has tested dozens of meal kits and Sunbasket ticked a lot of boxes for her. “ Thanks to seasonal ingredients and house-made spice blends and sauces, each of the meals I tried tasted fresh and flavorful. The kits arrived on-time and in good condition. In fact, I thought the packaging and quality of the meat and seafood was the best out of all of the meal kits I’ve tried.”
“Overall, I found Sunbasket to offer the most consistently delicious flavors and exciting ingredient combinations. I also appreciated that the meals I tried were bursting with vegetables, which isn’t always the case with meal kits.”
When asked to assess cost, Kelli had this to say: “While it isn’t cheap, I think Sunbasket is worth the cost if you value organic ingredients and exciting new flavor and ingredient combinations.”

Best low FODMAP
Meal type   prepared meals
Price per serving   $8.99 to $29.25
Why we like it:  All items on Epicured’s extensive menu of prepared entrees, salads, soups, and more are gluten-free recipes and  low FODMAP . The meals also receive high marks from our tester for variety and freshness.
How it works:  First you either select a subscription with Epicured, for a reduced price, or choose to do a one-time order. You then filter for different dietary preferences, such as vegetarian or vegan, low-sodium, dairy-free, among others, and choose from the large selection of entrees, sandwiches, soups, salads, snacks, smoothies, desserts and sides presented.
Each week you receive your box of “chilled” meals that should be stored in the refrigerator until ready to serve. Some items, labeled Freezer Friendly, can stored in the freezer until ready to eat. Each item includes a “best by” date.
For subscriptions, the service automatically regenerates your previous order. However, you can easily make changes to your menu selections, and pause or cancel your subscription.



Epicured is a great choice for those who prefer a low FODMAP meal plan. Registered dietitian, Kelli McGrane, had this to say after trying it: “I sampled several items from the main menu, including entrees, wraps, and salads. I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of cuisines, proteins, and types of vegetables offered and liked that there were many types of meals available.
“All of my meals arrived fresh and in good condition and I was particularly impressed by how fresh all of the vegetables tasted.”

Comparing gluten-free meal delivery services

How we test meal delivery services
We’ve  tested  nearly 30 of the most popular meal delivery services on the market.
Testers select a week’s worth of meals from multiple menus to get a well-rounded view of the types of flavors and ingredients offered.
During testing, we consider several factors, including the ease of the signup and meal selection process, the variety and nutritional composition of the meals offered, ingredient quality and freshness, how easy the meals are to cook, and, of course, the taste.
Every meal delivery service on our list has been reviewed by registered dietitians and vetted to ensure that it aligns with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being. Each service in this article:
is in compliance with USDA and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) food safety and manufacturing regulations
uses a trusted shipper to handle its food products
lists all ingredients, allergens, and nutrition facts on its website or product packaging
promotes a healthy approach to well-being
does not make unsupported health claims on its website or marketing materials
You can read more about  our vetting process .

How to choose a gluten-free meal delivery service
There are many factors to keep in mind when selecting a meal delivery service, especially if you follow a gluten-free diet:
Certification:  In particular, if you have  celiac disease  or another gluten-related condition, you can choose a service that is certified gluten-free or produces meals in a gluten-free facility to reduce the risk of cross-contamination.
Variety:  You may want to check the menu for meal variety, including options that fit your tastes. Some services also offer options for other dietary needs, such as vegetarian and  keto . This may be especially important if you have other dietary restrictions.
Ingredients:  If you prefer organic food or meals free of  artificial ingredients  and preservatives, you’ll want to browse company websites for more information about the quality of ingredients used.
Prep time:  Keep in mind that the amount of preparation required may vary. While some services  deliver dishes that are ready to eat , others provide  meal kits  that often require 20 to 40 minutes to cook.
Cost:  Along with the price of every meal, you’ll want to consider the total cost. That means accounting for factors such as shipping and other add-ons.
