Title: Can you Lose 10 Pounds in a Month?

It’s possible to lose 10 pounds in 1 month due to lifestyle and dietary changes. However, losing this much weight in 1 month may not be a safe target for everyone.
Increasing exercise levels and modifying your dietary choices are important ways of managing your weight safely and effectively.  Losing weight fast can be risky , however, so it’s best to focus on long-term goals.
We explain how specific changes might help you meet these goals.

1. Try cardio for weight loss
Aerobic exercise  — also known as cardio — is a type of physical activity that increases your heart rate to burn more calories and strengthen your heart and lungs.
One older  study from 2013  found that for overweight adults, burning 400 or 600 calories per aerobic exercise session 5 days per week for 10 months resulted in clinically significant weight loss.
Current  guidelines  recommend doing 150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 70–150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week.
Walking, jogging, boxing, biking, and  swimming  are just a few forms of cardio that can help burn calories and support weight loss.

Cardio can help you burn more calories to increase weight loss.

2. Eat fewer refined carbs
Cutting down on nutrient-poor,  refined carbs  can improve the quality of your diet and further weight loss.
Refined carbs are those that are stripped of their nutrient and fiber content during processing, such as white bread.
Refined carbs are  high in calories  and low in nutrients. Your body also absorbs them quickly into your bloodstream, which can lead to  blood sugar spikes  and increased hunger.
Research  has linked diets that are high in refined grains with a higher  body weight  compared with diets that are rich in nutritious  whole grains .
For best results, replace refined carbs like white bread,  breakfast cereals , and heavily processed packaged foods with whole grain products like  quinoa ,  oats , brown rice, and barley.
Refined carbs, which are low in nutrients, can cause spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels. Research shows that a higher intake of refined carbs may be linked to higher body weight and increased belly fat.

3. Counting calories
To lose weight, you need to use more calories than you consume, either by decreasing your calorie intake or by increasing your daily physical activity.
A moderately active adult male needs around  2,400 calories  per day, and a moderately active adult female needs 1,800 to provide enough energy for their body’s needs while maintaining a steady weight.
Counting calories can keep you accountable and increase your awareness of how your diet may impact your weight loss.
An  older review  from 2014 looked at data for over 16,000 people. It concluded that weight loss regimens that incorporated  calorie counting  resulted in an average of 7.3 pounds (3.3 kg) more weight loss per year than those that didn’t.
However, cutting calories alone may not be a sustainable strategy for long-term weight loss. You’ll likely need to pair it with other diet and lifestyle modifications.
Additionally, not all carbs are the same. Whole grains can be high in calories, but they also provide fiber and other essential nutrients. Fiber will help you feel full and satisfied for longer, which can contribute to weight management.
Recording your intake with an  app  or  food journal  is a good way to get started.
Counting your calories can help increase weight loss when combined with other diet and lifestyle changes.

4. Choose better beverages
Choosing healthier beverages may also help with weight loss.
Soda, juice, and  energy drinks  may have high levels of added  sugar  and extra calories that can contribute to weight gain over time.
One  review  concluded that, on average, drinking water at mealtimes for 12 weeks could lead to a 5.15% loss in weight, but better quality studies with more follow-up are needed.
To support weight loss, cut out high calorie, sweetened beverages and aim to drink 34–68 fluid ounces (1–2 liters) of water throughout the day.
Soda, juice, and sports drinks are high in calories and can contribute to weight gain. Instead, opt for water to drink.

5. Eat slowly
Slowing down and focusing on enjoying your food while listening to your body is an effective strategy to decrease intake and enhance feelings of fullness.
For example,  one study  in 25 women found that eating slowly resulted in  greater feelings of fullness  and satisfaction than eating quickly, which could make it a useful strategy for weight loss programs.
Taking smaller bites, drinking plenty of  water  with your meals, and reducing external distractions can help you  eat more slowly  to increase weight loss.
Eating slowly can decrease intake and improve feelings of fullness to enhance weight loss.

6. Add fiber to your diet
Fiber is a nutrient that moves through your body undigested, helping to stabilize blood sugar, slow stomach emptying, and keep you feeling full longer.  Experts  have linked  foods that are high in fiber  to weight loss.
Multiple studies demonstrate that  fiber  has a powerful effect on weight loss.
Current guidelines recommend consuming  28–36 grams  of fiber daily from foods such as fruits,  veggies ,  legumes , and whole grains.
Increasing fiber consumption has been linked to decreases in both calorie intake and body weight.

7. Eat a high protein breakfast
Increasing your intake of protein may help you  lose weight . Starting the day with a healthy  high protein breakfast , for instance, can leave you feeling satisfied and reduce the temptation to snack mid-morning.
Research  suggests a  high protein diet  may help with weight loss and reduce the risk of obesity and related issues, such as cardiovascular disease.
Oats,  yogurt , eggs,  cottage cheese , and  peanut butter  are a few staple foods you can enjoy as part of a healthy, high protein breakfast.
Increased morning protein intake is associated with greater feelings of fullness, decreased calorie intake, and reductions in body weight and belly fat.

8. Get enough sleep every night
A lack of sleep can disturb your metabolic and hormonal balance. A  2022 review  concluded that establishing a  regular sleep schedule  could help boost  weight loss  as well as overall health.
Most adults need at least  7 hours  of sleep in every 24 hours.
To increase your chances of getting enough sleep, try:
establishing regular sleep schedule
minimize distractions in the room where you sleep
avoid alcohol,  caffeine , and heavy meals before bedtime
While sleep deprivation can increase hunger, getting enough sleep can increase the likelihood of successful weight loss.

9. Add resistance training for weight loss
Resistance training  is a type of exercise that involves working against some type of force to build muscle and increase strength. It may not lead to  rapid weight loss  but it can help  improve body composition  while on a weight loss diet.
Examples include sit-ups and lifting weights.
This type of training may:
improve  lipid profiles
reduce  the loss of healthy lean mass during weight loss
reduce  fat mass
Get some tips on using bodyweight exercises as part of a resistance training program
Studies show that resistance training may preserve fat-free mass while you are losing weight.

10. Practice intermittent fasting
Intermittent fasting  involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting, with fasts typically lasting  16–24 hours .
Fasting  can reduce  the amount you eat by limiting the time frame in which you consume food. This may be  as effective as  traditional or continuous  calorie restriction  in helping you lose weight.
Learn about some ways to do intermittent fasting
Intermittent fasting can reduce your calorie intake by cutting down the number of hours in which you can eat.

11. Eat more vegetables
Vegetables are  nutrient-dense  foods that supply vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber for a low number of calories.
A  review  of 17 studies in more than 500,000 people found that those who ate the most  vegetables  had a 17% lower risk of being overweight or having obesity.
For an easy way to raise your veggie quota, squeeze an extra serving or two into side dishes,  salads , sandwiches, and snacks, or add  spinach ,  kale , or other veggies to a smoothie.
Vegetable consumption is linked to increased weight loss and a lower risk of obesity. A higher intake of fiber from foods such as vegetables is also associated with decreased calorie intake.

12. Skip the sauces and condiments
Mayonnaise, teriyaki sauce,  sour cream , butter,  maple syrup ,  dips, spreads  and other toppings can be high in calories. For example, a single tablespoon (13 grams) of mayonnaise can contain upwards of  90 calories .
Eliminating them from the diet is an easy way to cut calories.
Instead, use  herbs and spices  or low calorie options — like  hot sauce , mustard, or horseradish — to flavor your food.
Many condiments and sauces are high in calories. Cutting them out or swapping them for low calorie alternatives could aid weight loss.

13. Do HIIT exercises
High-intensity interval training (HIIT)  is a type of exercise that alternates between quick bursts of activity and brief recovery periods, keeping your heart rate up to boost fat burning and accelerate weight loss.
Adding HIIT to your routine can be an effective tool to support your weight loss journey.
One study  in nine men compared  the effects of HIIT  to running, biking, and resistance training, demonstrating that a 30-minute HIIT session burned 25–30% more calories than the other activities.
To get started, try switching your cardio for one or two HIIT workouts per week or alternating between running and walking for 30 seconds at a time.
Other activities you can incorporate into HIIT include jumping jacks,  squats , pushups, and burpees.
HIIT can burn more calories than other forms of exercise, thereby increasing weight loss and fat burning.

14. Move more throughout the day
If you can’t squeeze in a full workout, adding small amounts of activity can chip away at your body weight.
The term “non-exercise activity thermogenesis” (NEAT)  refers to  the calories your body burns throughout the day doing regular non-exercise activities like typing, gardening, walking, or even fidgeting.
It’s estimated that NEAT may account for  up to 50%  of the total  number of calories you burn  each day, depending on your activity level.
Making a few modifications to your daily routine can help you burn calories and speed up  weight loss  with minimal effort.
For instance, try:
parking farther away
using the stairs instead of the elevator
taking a walk  during your lunch break
stretching every 30 minutes
Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) can account for up to 50% of the total number of calories you burn each day. Moving more throughout the day can help you burn more calories to boost weight loss.

Frequently asked questions
How long it takes to lose 10 pounds will depend on various factors, including your own bodily features and the strategies you use. Often, however, any weight that you lose quickly will likely go back on again, so a long-term plan may be more effective.
There’s no guarantee that you can lose 10 pounds rapidly, but combining strategies such as exercise, dietary changes, strategies that make you feel full for longer, and getting enough sleep can help you manage your weight over the long term.
This will depend on your current your activity levels and the types of foods you eat.
Eating more calories than you need will  lead to weight gain , so reducing calorie intake will help you lose weight. You can use this  weight loss calculator  to help you figure out your goals and how to reach them.
Other tips include using a smaller plate at mealtimes and opting for a piece of fruit instead of a pastry for dessert or as a snack.

The bottom line
A collection of  small modifications  to your diet and lifestyle can help you lose weight, although 10 pounds in a month may not be a realistic target. In fact,  rapid weight loss may pose risks  to other aspects of your health.
Taking it one step at a time and making a few small changes each week can help you lose weight safely and  keep it off long-term .
