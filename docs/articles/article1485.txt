Title: What Is Senna Tea, and Is It Safe?

Senna tea is a popular herbal remedy that’s often marketed as a laxative, weight loss aid, and detox method.
However, there’s little scientific evidence to support the efficacy of senna tea for most of these uses — aside from treating constipation.
Still, you may want to know about this drink’s benefits and safety.
This article explains everything you need to know about senna tea.

What is senna?
Senna is an herbal medicine made from the leaves, flowers, and fruit of a large group of flowering plants in the legume family ( 1 ).
Extracts and teas made from senna plants have long been used as  laxatives  and stimulants in traditional herbal medicine ( 1 ).
Originally from Egypt, senna is now grown worldwide, including countries like India and Somalia.
Most commercial products are derived from  Cassia acutifolia  or  Cassia angustifolio , commonly known as Alexandrian and Indian senna, respectively ( 1 ).
Today, senna is most often sold as a tea or over-the-counter constipation supplement, but it’s also occasionally used in  weight loss pills  and drinks.
Senna is an herb in the legume family that’s often used as a laxative. Additionally, it’s sometimes added to weight loss supplements.

How is senna tea used?
The most common application for senna tea is to stimulate bowel movements and  alleviate constipation .
The primary active compounds in senna leaves are known as senna glycosides, or sennosides. Sennosides cannot be absorbed in your digestive tract, but they can be broken down by your gut bacteria ( 1 ).
This breakdown of sennosides mildly irritates the cells in your colon, an effect that stimulates intestinal movement and produces a laxative effect.
Senna is an active ingredient in many popular over-the-counter laxative medications, such as Ex-Lax and Nature’s Remedy. For most people, it will  stimulate a bowel movement  within 6–12 hours ( 2 ).
Because of its laxative effects, some people use senna tea to  prepare for colonoscopies  ( 3 ).
Some people may also use senna tea to relieve discomfort associated with hemorrhoids.
Hemorrhoids  are swollen veins and tissues in the lower rectum that can cause bleeding, pain, and itching. Chronic constipation is a major cause, and minor bouts of constipation can irritate preexisting hemorrhoids ( 4 ).
However, senna’s efficacy for relieving hemorrhoid symptoms has not been thoroughly studied.
Senna is primarily used to alleviate constipation, but some people may also use it to prepare for colonoscopies and manage hemorrhoid symptoms.

Senna tea should not be used for weight loss
Senna is increasingly included in herbal teas and supplements that claim to boost metabolism and promote weight loss. These products are often referred to as “skinny teas” or “teatoxes.”
Yet, no scientific evidence supports using senna tea for any  detox , cleanse, or weight loss routine.
In fact, using senna tea in this manner may be very dangerous.
Senna is not recommended for frequent or long-term use, as it may alter normal bowel tissue function and cause laxative dependence ( 2 ).
What’s more, a recent study in over 10,000 women found that those who used laxatives for weight loss were 6 times likelier to develop an eating disorder ( 5 ).
If you’re trying to lose weight,  dietary and lifestyle modifications  are your best bet — not supplements or laxatives.
Senna is frequently marketed as a weight loss tool, but there’s no evidence to support this effect. Due to its long-term health risks, you should not use senna to lose weight.

Safety, precautions, and side effects
Senna tea is generally considered safe for most adults and children over age 12. Nonetheless, it comes with several risks and side effects.
The most common side effects are stomach cramps,  nausea , and diarrhea. However, these symptoms are usually mild and tend to resolve relatively quickly ( 2 ).
Some people also experience allergic reactions to senna. If you’ve ever had a reaction to a product that contains senna, you should avoid senna tea ( 6 ).
Senna is meant to serve as a short-term constipation remedy. You shouldn’t use it for more than 7 consecutive days unless otherwise directed by your healthcare provider ( 2 ).
Long-term senna tea intake may lead to laxative dependence, electrolyte disturbances, and liver damage.
Furthermore, senna may negatively interact with certain types of medications, such as ( 6 ):
blood thinners
diuretics
steroids
licorice root
heart rhythm medications
If you have heart disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or liver disease, you should consult your healthcare provider prior to taking any senna product, as it may exacerbate these conditions ( 6 ).
Senna is not generally recommended for women who are  pregnant  or breastfeeding ( 6 ).
Common senna tea side effects include stomach cramps, diarrhea, and nausea. More serious side effects, such as liver damage, may occur from long-term use.

Recommended dosage
A typical dose of a senna-based supplement is 15–30 mg per day for no longer than 1 week ( 1 ).
However, there’s no clear dosing recommendation for senna tea.
It’s considerably more difficult to determine a precise dose because the concentration of sennosides varies dramatically depending on how long your tea steeps.
What’s more, many commercial senna teas, especially those that contain a blend of herbs, don’t state the exact amount of senna leaves used.
In this case, the safest approach is to follow the package instructions for preparation and consumption. Never take more than directed on the label.
Although no clear guidelines exist for senna tea dosage, you shouldn’t take more than directed on the package.

How to prepare senna tea at home
Senna tea is often described as having a mild, sweet, and slightly bitter flavor. Unlike many other herbal teas, it isn’t particularly aromatic on its own.
However, many commercial teas combine senna with other herbs that can alter the final aroma and flavor.
If you’re using tea bags or a blend, follow the package instructions.
If you’re preparing senna tea from scratch, steep 1–2 grams of dried senna leaves in hot water for 10 minutes. Avoid drinking more than 2 servings per day ( 7 ).
You can also add a touch of sweetener like  honey  or stevia.

If using tea bags or a blend, follow the package instructions. When using dry senna leaves, steep 1–2 grams of leaves in hot water for 10 minutes.

The bottom line
Senna tea is an herbal infusion regularly used to treat constipation.
While some people claim that it promotes  weight loss , you shouldn’t use it in any weight loss detox or cleanse. Doing so could lead to laxative dependence, liver damage, and other serious health issues.
Senna tea may cause short-term stomach cramps and  diarrhea . To minimize your risk of negative effects, you shouldn’t drink it for longer than 7 days in a row.
