Title: What Can You Make With Cucumbers? 13 Food Ideas

Cucumbers are a hydrating, low calorie fruit — though often considered a veggie — rich in disease-fighting nutrients like fiber, vitamin K, and antioxidants ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
They’re a wonderful addition to any diet and a beloved staple in home gardens, where they produce a lot of fruit with minimal maintenance. Plus, they’re commonly sold at farmers markets and included in community supported agriculture (CSA) shares.
If you have an abundance of cucumbers and wonder what to do with them, look no further.
Here are 12 ideas for ways to prepare cucumbers, plus a few of our favorite recipes to help you get started.

1–3. Cucumber recipes for breakfast
Breakfast may not seem like the most natural meal to add cucumbers to, but there are many ways to enjoy this hydrating fruit first thing in the morning.
Notably, cucumbers are a breakfast staple in some parts of the world.
Many Mediterranean cultures incorporate fruits and vegetables into breakfast regularly while some cultures in China pair cucumbers with eggs.
To start your day with cucumbers, try:
Turkish-inspired breakfast salad
stir-fried cucumbers with scrambled eggs
Cucumbers have a fairly mild flavor, so you can easily add them to any of your favorite smoothies. Otherwise, try one of these recipes that highlight cucumbers themselves:
power green cucumber smoothie
easy cucumber smoothie
creamy pineapple cucumber cmoothie
cucumber watermelon smoothie
You can easily make a cucumber yogurt parfait savory or sweet.
If you’re in the mood for something savory (and have a little more time on your hands), try  this yogurt bowl  with cucumbers, melon, and chickpeas or  this one  that incorporates beets and pistachios alongside cucumbers.
For a sweet version, try this  strawberry cucumber breakfast yogurt .

4–6. Cucumber lunch ideas
If you’re looking for a simple way to add something green to your lunch, cucumbers are the way to go.
You may already enjoy adding cucumbers to veggie sandwiches or atop traditional deli meats like ham and turkey. You may also be familiar with  classic cucumber sandwiches  that pair creamy cheeses with this crisp, crunchy fruit.
If you want to make cucumbers the highlight of your sandwich, try swapping bread out for cucumber.
What’s more, you can slice cucumbers in small rounds to make  bite-sized snacks  or long slices to mimic  deli-style hoagies .
You can even try cutting a single cucumber in half, scooping out the insides, and packing the interior with your favorite sandwich ingredients to mimic a sub sandwich, as  this recipe  suggests.
Kimchi  is a Korean dish made from fermented vegetables, garlic, ginger, and chili peppers. It’s nutrient dense and packed with beneficial probiotics.
It’s often made with cabbage, but cucumbers are commonly used in kimchi as well.
Here are a few cucumber kimchi recipes to try:
oi kimchi (cucumber kimchi)
cucumber mak kimchi
There’s a reason why cucumber salads are one of the main ways to enjoy this fruit. They’re fresh, fairly simple to make, and packed with flavor.
If you’re tired of the usual combos with dill or tomatoes, try one of these instead:
pear and cucumber salad with caramelized rosemary tempeh
cucumber salad with honeydew, feta, and mint
sesame soy cucumber salad with honey-roasted peanuts
cucumber salad with shrimp and celery

7–9. Cucumber dinner recipes
Replacing traditional wheat or grain-based noodles with  spiralized veggies  is a simple way to cut back on your meal’s carb and calorie count while adding extra nutrients like vitamins and minerals.
Cucumbers make a great spiralized veggie due to their naturally long shape.
If you have a spiralizer at home, you can easily make recipes like these:
Greek cucumber noodles
cucumber noodles with tahini sauce
sesame cucumber noodles
Especially in the heat of summer, a cool cucumber soup is refreshing — and appeals to the eye with its bright green color. Plus, cucumbers are the perfect partner to summer herbs like  basil  and cilantro.
Cool off this summer with one of these cucumber soup recipes:
cucumber, tomatillo, and cilantro gazpacho
cucumber, avocado, and honeydew gazpacho
basil cucumber gazpacho
Cucumber boats are a great vehicle for packing in extra veggies, grains, and protein.
Simply cut a cucumber in half, scoop out a small amount of the flesh, and fill it with the toppings of your choice.  Chicken salad  is a great place to start, as are  shrimp  and  Italian combos .

10–12. Cucumber snacks and other ideas
Pickles, drinks, and chips are other fun ways to eat cucumbers.
Arguably one of the most popular ways to enjoy this fruit is in the form of pickles.
Not only are pickles a fresh, crunchy, low calorie snack, but making your own is a great way to preserve cucumbers when you’ve got a big batch and need to save them before they spoil.
Here’s a recipe for a classic  dill pickle  that doesn’t require any canning but stays fresh in the fridge for a few weeks.
You may also be interested in this  Mediterranean-inspired pickle recipe  that’s flavored with coriander, bay leaf, and jalapeños.
Cucumbers are in their prime during the peak of summer. They’re already quite refreshing, but you can add them to desserts and summertime drinks — alcoholic and nonalcoholic alike — to help cool off.
For example,  cucumber juice  alone is hydrating and nutritious. So is  cucumber lemonade .
For an alcoholic treat, try  cucumber margaritas  a  cucumber cooler .
For desserts,  cucumber sorbet  and  cucumber-strawberry  or  cucumber-watermelon  popsicles are all easy to make at home with just a handful of ingredients.
Cucumbers are renowned for their crunch when fresh or pickled, but they work surprisingly well as dried chips, too.
You can  make your own cucumber chips  with a food dehydrator or in your oven.
Both methods take a few hours between the prep and the cook time, so cucumber chips may be best when you have a big batch of cucumbers.

The bottom line
Cucumbers are a healthy, refreshing  fruit . You can enjoy them throughout the day in meals, snacks, drinks, and desserts alike.

Try this today:  Many of  cucumber’s health benefits  are attributed to the nutrients found in its skin. To get the most nutrition from this fruit, leave the skin on rather than peeling it.
