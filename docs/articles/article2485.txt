Title: 17 Cheap and Healthy Sources of Protein

Protein is a crucial nutrient. While some sources of protein are expensive, there are also many affordable alternatives.
There are numerous benefits to adding protein-rich foods to your diet, including increased muscle mass and satiety, which can also support weight management ( 1 ,  2 ).
Luckily, there are many delicious choices that suit every dietary need.
However, some people may find healthy protein sources to be too costly.
Here are 17 healthy protein sources that won’t break the bank.

1. Natural peanut butter
For a plant-based option,  peanut butter  provides a solid dose of protein. It is also cost-friendly, with an average cost of around $2.50 per 16-ounce (454-gram) jar.
A two-tablespoon serving of this creamy nut butter provides 7 grams of protein ( 3 ).
Aside from being a good source of  protein , peanut butter can be used in many ways. Pair it with fruit and oatmeal or add it to your favorite smoothie for a protein boost.
What’s more, studies have shown that people who include peanuts and peanut butter in their diets are less likely to develop certain chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes ( 4 ,  5 ).
Choose natural peanut butter when possible to avoid unwanted ingredients like added sugar and added saturated fats.

2. Eggs
Eggs  are one of the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet, and are very affordable with an average price of $2 to $4 per dozen.
Not only are they full of vitamins, minerals and healthy fats, but they are also packed with protein. One large egg contains 6 grams ( 6 ).
Adding eggs to your diet is a great way to increase your protein intake and may also help you reduce your calorie intake and lose weight.
Several studies have shown that having eggs for breakfast helps you eat fewer calories throughout the day by keeping hunger in check. This can, in turn, help you lose weight.
For example, one 2008 study found that participants who consumed an egg breakfast for eight weeks lost 65% more weight than those who ate a bagel breakfast ( 7 ).
Another 2010 study showed that eating eggs for breakfast suppressed the hunger hormone ghrelin and helped stabilize blood sugar and insulin response ( 8 ).
Eating eggs may lead to decreased feelings of hunger and fewer cravings, which is great for weight loss.

3. Edamame
This tasty, bright green bean is an amazing, low-priced source of plant-based protein.
Edamame  beans are immature soybeans that are sold both shelled or in the pod. They are a delicious snack and make a great addition to meals like salads and stir-frys.
Plus, edamame is an excellent source of protein with one cup of shelled beans (160 grams) providing an impressive 18 grams of protein ( 9 ).
Edamame is also a great choice for those who follow vegetarian or vegan diets.
This is because they are considered a complete protein source, meaning they contain all the essential amino acids that the body requires ( 10 ).
This budget-friendly bean can be found in the freezer section of most grocery stores for around $2 per 12-ounce (340-gram) bag.

4. Canned tuna
Fish is a fantastic  source of protein  and the canned version is no exception.
If fresh fish is too expensive for your budget, canned tuna is an excellent way to boost your protein intake without breaking the bank.
Most brands of tuna cost around $1 per 5-ounce (142-gram) can.
For only 99 calories, a 3-ounce (85-gram) serving only contains 22 grams of high-quality protein ( 11 ).
Additionally, tuna is a great source of  omega-3 fatty acids , which help fight inflammation in the body ( 12 ).
However, canned tuna may contain high levels of mercury, so it’s best for adults to limit their intake to a few servings per week ( 13 ).
Always choose canned light tuna, which is made with smaller types of tuna that are lower in mercury.

5. Plain Greek yogurt
Greek yogurt is a delicious, low-cost food that is extremely versatile. It can be eaten plain, added to a smoothie, whipped into a tasty dip for veggies or added to baked goods.
Additionally, yogurt is an excellent source of protein.
In fact, an 100-gram serving provides around 9 grams of protein — over double the amount found in regular plain yogurts ( 14 ,  15 ).
Look for brands with a “live and active cultures” label, which means that the yogurt contains beneficial probiotics that can improve gut health and even help you lose weight ( 16 ).
Not to mention, choosing plain, unsweetened  Greek yogurt  is a great way to keep your intake of added sugar to a minimum.
Lastly, buying larger containers is a great way to save money, as 24 ounces (680 grams) of plain Greek yogurt costs about $5.

6. Sunflower seeds
Although sunflower seeds are tiny, they contain an impressive amount of protein. A one ounce serving contains about 6 grams of plant-based,  vegan-friendly protein  ( 17 ).
These buttery-tasting nutritional powerhouses are a good source of protein, as well as nutrients like vitamin E and magnesium.
Sunflower seeds are a versatile and cost-friendly food, too.
They can be purchased for around $2 per pound (454 grams) at most stores, and can be added to salads or yogurt parfaits, as well as used as a crunchy topping for many dishes.

7. Black beans
Black beans are one of the most convenient and affordable forms of plant-based protein that you can buy. On average, a 15-ounce (455-gram) can costs around $1 in most stores.
One half cup (86 grams) of black beans also contains 7.6 grams of protein ( 18 ).
On top of containing a good amount of protein, black beans are an excellent source of fiber. One half cup (86 grams) contains about 7.5 grams.
Top health organizations recommend that women eat 25 grams of fiber per day and that men eat 38 grams per day.
Due to the high amounts of protein and fiber that they contain, black beans make you feel full and are excellent for weight loss.
In fact, a 2016 review of 21 studies found eating 3/4 of a cup of beans each day led to weight loss of 0.75 pounds (0.34 kg) for people who made no other dietary changes ( 19 ).
Moreover, diets rich in beans have been shown to reduce hunger and increase fullness ( 20 ,  21 ).
They can be added to dishes like chili, soups and salads to provide a powerful punch of plant-based protein.

8. Sardines
Although sardines may not be the most popular food, they are full of protein and important nutrients.
One can (92 grams) of sardines contains about 23 grams of highly absorbable protein plus many other important nutrients like vitamin D and B12 ( 22 ).
Since sardines are meant to be consumed whole, bones and all, they are a great source of natural calcium.
In fact, one can provides 27% of the recommended intake for this bone-building mineral ( 23 ).

The high protein content of cottage cheese makes it an excellent choice for athletes and people looking to build muscle mass.
Plus, studies have shown that protein-rich foods like cottage cheese help keep you feeling full, which may help you lose weight ( 25 ,  26 ).
Cottage cheese is very affordable and can be purchased at most stores for around $3 per 16-ounce (452-gram) tub.

10. Whey protein
Whey protein powder is made from the liquid portion of milk leftover from cheesemaking.
Adding  whey protein powder  to your diet is a convenient and affordable way to boost your protein intake. On average, a serving of whey protein costs just $0.40.
Whey protein has been thoroughly researched for its beneficial role in weight loss and its ability to increase muscle mass and strength ( 27 ,  28 ,  29 ).
On average, one scoop (26 grams) of whey protein powder provides an impressive 20 grams of protein ( 30 ).
Whey protein powder can be added to smoothies, baked goods and other recipes for an extra dose of protein.

11. Lentils
Not only are lentils a highly nutritious and affordable food, but they are also a great source of protein.
Found in the bulk section of most grocery stores for around $1.50 per pound (453 grams), these tiny legumes can be cooked and added to a variety of recipes like soups, stews and curries.
They are an amazing source of plant-based protein, with half a cup (99 grams) providing 9 grams ( 31 ).
Lentils are high in fiber, iron, potassium and B vitamins, as well.

Oats  are high in vitamins and minerals, plus contain a type of soluble fiber called beta-glucan.
Studies have shown that foods rich in beta-glucan may help reduce LDL and total cholesterol levels, making oatmeal a great choice for heart health ( 33 ).
A bowl of oatmeal is a great way to keep your heart healthy and can be part of a high protein breakfast, if combined with milk, adding nuts or seeds, topping with peanut butter, or mixing in protein powder or liquid egg whites to boost the protein content of an oat based breakfast.

13. Amaranth
While amaranth may not be a staple in your pantry, this protein-packed,  gluten-free grain  deserves a spot in your diet.
One cup (246 grams) of cooked amaranth provides over 9 grams of protein and is also a great source of folate, manganese, magnesium, phosphorus and iron ( 34 ).

One cup (249 grams) of whole milk contains over 8 grams of highly absorbable protein, along with loads of vitamins and minerals ( 35 ).
It is especially high in the minerals calcium and phosphorus, which help keep bones strong and healthy.
Since milk is a liquid, it can be used as a high-protein base for smoothies and soups.
Whole milk also makes an excellent high-calorie, protein-rich ingredient for those who are trying to gain weight and muscle mass. Meanwhile, skim milk contains the same amount of protein with about half the calories for those who are trying to lose weight and maintain muscle mass.

Pumpkin seeds deliver a massive amount of nutrients in a very small package. Adding these budget-friendly seeds to your diet is a smart and healthy way to increase your protein intake.
Just one ounce (28 grams) of  pumpkin seeds  contains 8 grams of protein, making them an excellent choice for a snack ( 36 ).
