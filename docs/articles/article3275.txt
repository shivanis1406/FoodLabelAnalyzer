Title: The Top 4 Treatment Options for Food Addiction

Food addiction, which  is not listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  ( DSM-5 ), can be similar to other addictions and often requires similar treatments and support to overcome.
Fortunately,  several programs and therapies may provide treatment.
This article lists the 4 most common food addiction treatment options.

1. 12-step programs
One way to address food addiction is to find a good 12-step program.
These are almost identical to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) — except the substance of addiction is different.
In a 12-step program, people attend meetings with others who also struggle with food addiction. Eventually, they get a sponsor to help them develop a dietary regimen.
Social support can make a big impact when dealing with food addiction. Finding people who share similar experiences and are willing to help can be beneficial to recovery.
In addition, 12-step programs are free and usually available worldwide.
There are several different programs to choose from.
Overeaters Anonymous  (OA) is the largest and most popular option, with regular meetings across the world.
Greysheeters Anonymous  (GSA) is similar to OA, except they provide a meal plan that involves weighing and measuring three meals per day. While they’re not as widespread as OA, they offer phone and Skype meetings.
Other groups include  Food Addicts Anonymous (FAA)  and  Food Addicts in Recovery Anonymous (FA) .
These groups are designed to provide a welcoming, nonjudgmental space.
SUMMARY Twelve-step  programs provide access to peers and mentors who can help you overcome food  addiction. These programs are available worldwide.

2. Cognitive behavioral therapy
A psychological approach called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown great promise in treating various eating disorders, such as  binge eating disorder  and bulimia ( 1 ).
These conditions share many of the same symptoms as food addiction.
When looking for a psychologist, ask to be referred to someone who has experience with food addiction or related  eating disorders .
SUMMARY Seeing  a psychologist who specializes in eating disorders or food addiction can help you  overcome food addiction. Additionally, CBT has been proven effective in some  cases.

3. Commercial treatment programs
Twelve-step programs are usually free, but several commercial treatment programs also offer effective treatments for feeding and eating disorders.
Major ones include:
ACORN : They offer several treatment options, mostly in the  United States.
Milestones in Recovery : Located in Florida,  they offer long-term treatment for food addiction.
COR  Retreat :  Located in Minnesota, they offer a 5-day program.
The Turning Point : Based in Florida, they have options for several  feeding and eating disorders.
Shades of Hope : Located in Texas, they offer both 6- and 42-day  programs.
PROMIS : Based in the UK, they  offer treatment for various feeding and eating disorders.
Bittens Addiction : They offer various  options for those with feeding and eating disorders in Sweden.
This webpage lists numerous individual health professionals across the globe who have experience treating food addiction.
SUMMARY Commercial  treatment programs for food addiction are available throughout the world.

4. Psychiatrists and drug therapy
While the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any drugs for the treatment of food addiction, medication is another option to consider.
That said, medications are not guaranteed to work for feeding and eating disorders and tend to have side effects.
One drug to consider is approved by the FDA to aid weight loss and contains  bupropion  and naltrexone. It’s marketed under the brand name Contrave in the United States and Mysimba in Europe.
This drug directly targets some of the brain pathways involved in the addictive nature of food. Studies suggest that it may be effective, especially when combined with healthy lifestyle changes ( 2 ,  3 ).
In many cases,  depression and anxiety  may contribute to feeding and eating disorders. Taking antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication could help relieve some of those symptoms ( 4 ).
Antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications do not cure food addiction, but they may be a useful tool to help ease symptoms of depression and anxiety. This can allow a person to focus on recovering from a feeding or eating disorder.
A psychiatrist can explain the different options available and make a recommendation based on an individual’s circumstance or specific treatment plan.
SUMMARY Consider  seeing a psychiatrist to discuss other treatment options, including medications.  Various drugs and mental health treatments may help with overcoming food  addiction.

The bottom line
Food addiction is a mental health issue in which a person becomes addicted to food, especially  processed junk foods .
Numerous scientific studies confirm that food addiction involves the same brain areas as drug addiction ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
Because  food addiction  does not resolve on its own, it’s best to pursue a treatment option to live healthfully.
