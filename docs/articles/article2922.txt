Title: Is Instant Oatmeal Healthy? Here’s What a Dietitian Says

Instant oats are the most processed form of oats available. They’re thinner, precooked, and the fastest to prepare. They commonly come preportioned and packaged with added flavorings and sugars.
All  oats  are made from oat groats, a nutrient- and fiber-rich whole grain with only the husk removed.
Instant oats, the most processed form, are made by cutting oat groats into small pieces, steaming them, and rolling them into thin flakes.
This process removes a minimal amount of nutrients. However, instant oats are commonly packaged in individual portions with additives – such as artificial flavors, milk powder, and sugars — that may work against your health goals.
Because instant oats are thinner and steamed at a higher temperature than quick oats, they are even faster to prepare. When cooked, they yield a softer, mushier texture than other  types of oats .

What are the benefits of instant oatmeal?
Just like  rolled oats and steel cut oats , instant oatmeal is a nutrient-dense  whole grain  with many health benefits.
Instant oats are a  good source  of carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and fiber. They also deliver a good amount of protein and fat.
Regular consumption of oatmeal  has been linked  to a variety of health benefits. Some research has  linked  eating oatmeal with better cholesterol levels, improved blood pressure and blood sugar regulation, and reduced inflammation.
The fiber in oatmeal may  help with   constipation , contribute to regular bowel movements, and improve stool consistency. It may  also lead  to a healthier gut microbiome.
Lastly, instant oatmeal is a relatively inexpensive food. Depending on the brand, flavor, and number of servings, instant oats generally cost less than $0.30 per serving. You can buy in bulk to save even more.
And if you’re buying in bulk, you don’t need to worry about the oatmeal going bad quickly or losing its nutritional value. Instant oats are a  shelf-stable food  and can last 1–2 years without refrigeration.

How do you prepare instant oats?
Because instant oatmeal is precooked, it can be enjoyed cold and is very quick to heat.
For the most basic hot preparation of instant oatmeal, you can simply add hot water or milk and stir. Alternatively, you can add cold water or milk and stick the mixture in the microwave. In 1–2 minutes, your oatmeal will be ready to eat.
By comparison, rolled oats can take 5–10 minutes and steel cut oats can take 20–30 minutes to cook on the stovetop.
Instant oats are an incredibly versatile ingredient. They have a mild flavor and can be prepared  savory or sweet .
You can also add them to smoothies and baked goods or use them as a gluten-free substitute for breadcrumbs in dishes that require a binder or thickener, such as  meatloaf ,  burgers , and  soups .

What are the nutritional facts for instant oats?
Here’s a comparison of the  nutrition data  for several common varieties of instant oats.

Are there any downsides to instant oatmeal?
Plain, unflavored instant oatmeal and regular oatmeal are nutritionally very similar.
While instant oatmeal offers the same health benefits as regular oatmeal, many instant oatmeal packets come with added flavors and sugars.
Some brands and flavors may contain anywhere from 10 to 17 grams of added sugar. If you’re concerned about added sugars, you may want to choose a lower sugar variety or opt for plain oats and add your own toppings for flavor.
Compared with other types of instant breakfast cereals, instant oatmeal  can be  more filling and keep you full longer.
However, instant oatmeal  may not  be filling or satisfying enough on its own. Adding protein and fat  can help  you feel full until your next meal or snack.
For example, you may want to add fruit, nut butter, seeds, chocolate, or avocado. For a savory meal, you can add sauteed vegetables, aromatics and herbs, cheese, olive oil, or even a fried egg.
If a recipe calls for rolled or steel cut oats, you may be able to use instant oatmeal as a substitute, but it may not work in all recipes. Because instant oatmeal is much thinner and cooks faster than the other types of oats, it may change the texture or consistency of the food when cooked or baked.

The bottom line
Instant oatmeal is an inexpensive and nutrient-dense food that is quick and easy to prepare. It offers health benefits for your heart, gut, and arteries, as well as convenience and versatility.
While some varieties of packaged instant oatmeal include added sugars and flavorings, they can still be part of a healthy diet.
If you’re concerned about the additives, you can always opt for plain instant oatmeal and add your own toppings for flavor.
