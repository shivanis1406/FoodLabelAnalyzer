Title: 4 Benefits of Maca Root (and Potential Side Effects)

Maca is a plant that originated in Peru. Its root is a natural remedy that some people use to treat specific health issues, including infertility and low sex drive. However, more research is needed.
Maca is a plant that some populations in Peru  have used  for thousands of years as food and medicinally.
In the last few decades, maca has grown in popularity. This article explains what maca root is, highlights some potential benefits, and answers whether it’s safe to add to your diet.

What does maca root do for the body?
The maca plant, called Lepidium meyenii or “Peruvian ginseng,” is a  cruciferous vegetable  related to broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and kale.
Native to the high Andean plateaus, it has been cultivated for over 2,000 years and can survive the harsh weather of the Peruvian Andes above 4,000 meters (m) or 13,123 feet (ft). Traditionally, the Andean people  used  maca as food or medication to treat respiratory conditions and rheumatic disease.
Maca products have increased in popularity due to claims they may help  increase libido  and fertility. Maca is now grown worldwide, including in China’s Yunnan province.
It contains beneficial compounds, including:
fiber
vitamins and minerals
bioactive compounds, such as macamides, macaridine, alkaloids, and glucosinolates
However, research on its benefits has been mixed, with more studies needed to support the claims.
Here are some potential benefits of maca.
People in Peru have used maca for thousands of years as food and natural medication.

Maca may help with libido, sexual function, and fertility
It’s still unclear whether maca has any real benefit for  treating low libido ,  sexual dysfunction , or  infertility  in either males or females. The available studies have shown mixed results.
People often use the terms sex and gender interchangeably, but they have different meanings:
“Sex” refers to the physical characteristics that differentiate male, female, and intersex bodies.
“Gender” refers to a person’s identity and how they feel inside. Examples include man, woman, nonbinary, agender, bigender, genderfluid, pangender, and trans. A person’s gender identity may be different from the sex they were assigned at birth.
While many studies on maca have not been conducted on human subjects,  some research  suggests it may benefit males with  low sexual desire  or libido.
A  2019 study  suggests combining maca with Chinese chive seed (Allium tuberosum) improved  erectile dysfunction  in male mice.
A 2020 study suggests that taking 2 grams (g) of maca per day for 12 weeks may  significantly improve  sperm concentration compared with a placebo treatment. However, they didn’t find a significant difference in  sperm motility  between the treatment and placebo groups.
One  older 2015 study  of 45 females with  antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction  also suggests that taking 3,000 milligrams (mg) of maca root per day for 12 weeks significantly improved sexual function and libido compared with a placebo.
However, larger studies in humans are still needed to investigate the effects of maca on female libido and sexual function.
Limited evidence suggests that maca may help improve sexual desire, erectile dysfunction, and fertility. However, research is limited at this time.

Maca may help relieve symptoms of menopause
Menopause  happens naturally in people who menstruate. It’s the time of life when menstrual periods stop permanently.
Research  suggests that maca may benefit people going through menopause by helping to relieve some symptoms, including  hot flashes  and interrupted sleep.
According to limited findings, maca may help reduce some menopausal symptoms. However, there’s not enough evidence to determine its true effectiveness.

Maca may improve mood and energy
Limited evidence suggests that maca may help improve energy levels and enhance mood.
A  2021 study  in mice found maca helped regulate exercise-induced fatigue. Another  2022 study  on mice came to a similar conclusion.
A  2022 study  in young adult females also showed that maca extract might reduce fatigue. Meanwhile, a 2016 study of 175 people living at either low or high altitudes demonstrated that taking 3 g of red or black maca daily for 12 weeks improved mood and energy scores compared with a placebo.
However, there is not enough evidence yet to draw firm conclusions about maca’s impact on energy or mood.
Some evidence suggests that maca may help improve energy and positively affect mood. However, research is limited at this time.

Other potential health benefits of maca
Human research investigating the potential health benefits of maca is limited.
However, initial findings from test tube studies and animal studies in mice and rats suggest maca may benefit health by:
helping preserve  cognitive function
supporting  treatment of  benign prostatic hyperplasia  (BPH)
helping  wound healing
containing  anti-inflammatory properties
containing  prebiotic nutrients that may support digestion
Keep in mind that there’s currently no evidence that these potential benefits apply to humans, so research on humans would be needed to investigate them.
Limited evidence from animal research suggests that maca may have benefits for BPH, brain health, and skin health.

How to use maca
Maca is an edible plant and is also available in other forms, including capsules and powders.
You can add maca powder to smoothies, oatmeal, baked goods, energy bars, and more. Its nutty, butterscotch-like taste pairs well with many sweeter flavors.
The optimal dose for medicinal use of maca has not been established. However, the dosage of maca root powder used in studies generally ranges from  1.5 to 3 g  per day.
If you want to ensure you choose higher-quality maca or get a personalized dosage recommendation, speak with a qualified healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian or physician. Because supplements are not regulated like medications, it’s best to choose brands verified by third parties to ensure they contain what they say on the label.

Frequently asked questions
Maca is generally safe to eat as part of your regular diet. Research has found it safe to take as a supplement of up to  3 g per day  for no longer than four months.
However,  a 2018 study  examined a case of a woman whose blood l ead concentration increased after she consumed a maca supplement.
It’s important to research the product you use, especially if you are pregnant or nursing. It isn’t known whether maca is safe to consume during pregnancy or nursing. Talk with a doctor before trying maca or any other supplements, especially if you have any medical conditions or are taking any medications.
Maca  doesn’t increase  testosterone levels.  Research  suggests there is no statistical difference in terms of testosterone levels between subjects who used maca root and those who didn’t.
The length of time before you see a positive effect depends on the type of effect you’re interested in. However, various research studies have found noticeable positive effects after  12 weeks  of maca use.

The bottom line
Although research on the potential health effects of maca is limited, some evidence suggests maca supplements may help improve certain aspects of sexual health and fertility, reduce  menopause symptoms , and improve mood in certain people.
However, scientists need to study maca more extensively before recommending it for treating any health condition or symptom.
If you’re interested in taking maca, consult a healthcare professional first. They can help you determine whether maca is the right choice for your health needs.
