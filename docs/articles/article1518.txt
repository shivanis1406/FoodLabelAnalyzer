Title: Nutrition and Health Benefits of Carrots

Carrots contain many nutrients, including beta-carotene and antioxidants, that may support your overall health as part of a nutrient-rich diet.
The carrot (Daucus carota) is a root vegetable often claimed to be the perfect health food. It is crunchy, tasty, and highly nutritious.
Carrots are a particularly good source of beta-carotene, fiber, vitamin K1, potassium, and antioxidants. Plus, they’re low in calories.
They also have several health benefits. They have been linked to lower cholesterol levels and improved eye health. What’s more, their carotene antioxidants have been linked to a reduced risk of cancer.
Carrots are found in many colors, including yellow, white, orange, red, and purple. Orange carrots get their bright color from beta carotene, an antioxidant that your body converts into vitamin A.
This article tells you everything you need to know about carrots.

Nutrition facts
A carrot’s water content ranges from  86% to 95% , and the edible portion consists of around  10%  carbs.
Carrots contain  very little fat  and protein.
The nutrition facts for two small-to-medium raw carrots, or  100 grams  (g), are:
Calories:  41
Water:  89%
Protein:  0.8 g
Carbs:  9.0 g
Fiber:  2.7 g
Fat:  0.1 g
Carrots are mainly composed of water and  carbs .
The carbs consist of starch and sugars, such as sucrose and glucose. They are also a relatively good source of fiber, with one medium-sized carrot (61 g) providing  1.9 g .
Carrots often rank low on the glycemic index (GI), which is a measure of how quickly foods raise blood sugar after a meal. Their GI ranges from 30 to 85, while the glycemic load ranges from 2.0 to 4.25. It’s the  lowest for raw  carrots, and  higher for cooked  ones.
Eating  low glycemic foods  is  linked to  numerous health benefits and is considered particularly beneficial for people with diabetes.
Pectin is the main form of soluble fiber in carrots.
Soluble fibers  can lower blood sugar levels by slowing down your digestion of sugar and starch.
They can also feed the friendly bacteria in your gut, which may lead to improved health and decreased risk of disease.
What’s more, certain soluble fibers can impair the absorption of cholesterol from your digestive tract, lowering blood cholesterol.
The main insoluble fibers in carrots are cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Insoluble fibers may reduce your risk of  constipation  and promote regular bowel movements.

Vitamins and minerals
Carrots are a good source of several vitamins and minerals, especially biotin, potassium, and vitamins A (from beta carotene), K1 (phylloquinone), and B6.
Vitamin A:  Carrots are rich in beta-carotene, which your body converts into  vitamin A . This nutrient promotes good vision and is important for growth, development, and immune function.
Biotin:  A B vitamin formerly known as vitamin H, biotin plays an important role in fat and protein metabolism.
Vitamin K1:  Also known as phylloquinone, vitamin K1 is important for blood coagulation and can promote bone health.
Potassium:  An essential mineral,  potassium  is important for blood pressure management.
Vitamin B6:  A group of related vitamins, B6 is involved in the conversion of food into energy.

Other plant compounds
Carrots offer many plant compounds, including carotenoids.
These are substances with powerful antioxidant activity that have been linked to improved immune function and reduced risk of many illnesses, including heart disease, various degenerative ailments, and certain types of cancer.
Beta carotene, the main carotene in carrots, can be converted into vitamin A in your body. However, this conversion process may vary by individual. Eating fat with carrots can help you absorb more of the beta carotene.
The main plant compounds in carrots are:
Beta carotene:  Orange carrots are very high in beta carotene. The absorption is better if the carrots are cooked.
Alpha-carotene:  This is an antioxidant that, like beta-carotene, is partly converted into vitamin A in your body.
Lutein:  One of the most common antioxidants in carrots, lutein is predominantly found in yellow and orange carrots and is important for  eye health .
Lycopene:  This is a bright red antioxidant found in many red  fruits  and vegetables, including red and purple carrots. Lycopene may decrease your risk of cancer and heart disease. Cooking carrots helps release lycopene and improves absorption.
Polyacetylenes:  Recent research has identified bioactive compounds in carrots that may help protect against leukemia and other cancers.
Anthocyanins:  These are powerful antioxidants found in dark-colored carrots.

Health benefits of carrots
Much of the research on carrots has focused on carotenoids.
Diets rich in carotenoids may help protect against several types of  cancer . This includes prostate, colon, and stomach cancers.
Females with high circulating levels of carotenoids may also have a  reduced risk  of breast cancer.
Carotenoids have been found to protect against lung cancer, but  further research is needed  to confirm a correlation.
High blood cholesterol is a well-known risk factor for  heart disease .
Consuming carrots has been  linked to  lower cholesterol levels.
As a low calorie food, carrots can increase fullness and decrease  calorie intake  in subsequent meals.
For this reason, they may be a useful addition to an effective weight loss diet.
Individuals with  low vitamin A levels  are more likely to experience night blindness, a condition that may diminish by eating carrots or other foods rich in vitamin A or carotenoids.
Carotenoids may also cut your risk of age-related macular degeneration.

Organic vs. conventionally grown carrots
Organic farming uses natural methods for growing crops, though it should be noted that organic crops may be treated with natural pesticides made from plants.
A  2012 study  comparing  organic  and conventionally grown carrots did not find any difference in the amount of carotenoids or antioxidant content and quality.
However, conventionally grown carrots contain pesticide residues. The long-term health effects of low-grade pesticide intake are unclear, but  some scientists  have voiced concerns. Washing and peeling carrots before you eat them raw or cook them will remove any residues effectively.

Baby carrots
Baby carrots are an increasingly popular  snack food .
Two kinds of carrots are called baby carrots, which can be misleading:
whole carrots harvested while still small
baby-cut carrots, which are pieces from larger carrots that have been machine-cut into the preferred size, then peeled, polished, and sometimes washed in small amounts of chlorine before packing
There’s very little difference in nutrients between regular and baby carrots, and they should have the same health effects.

Individual concerns
Carrots are generally considered safe to eat but may have adverse effects in some people.
Additionally, eating too much carotene can cause your skin to become a little yellow or orange, but this is harmless.
According to a  2001 study , carrots can cause pollen-related  allergic reactions  in up to 25% of individuals with a food allergy.
Carrot allergy is an example of cross-reactivity in which the proteins in certain fruits or vegetables cause an allergic reaction because of their similarity to the proteins found in certain types of pollen.
If you are sensitive to birch pollen or mugwort pollen, you might react to carrots.
This can cause your mouth to tingle or itch. In some people, it may trigger swelling of the throat or a severe allergic shock, known as anaphylaxis.
Carrots grown in contaminated soil or exposed to contaminated water may harbor larger amounts of heavy metals, which can affect their safety and quality.
Yet the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  regularly surveys foods sold in the United States and tests them for potential contaminants, including arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury.

The bottom line
Carrots are a great snack — crunchy, full of nutrients, low in calories, and sweet.
They’re associated with heart and eye health, improved digestion, and even  weight loss .
This  root vegetable  comes in several colors, sizes, and shapes, all of which are great additions to a healthy diet.
