Comparing brands

How to choose a healthy ice cream
Choosing a healthier ice cream depends, first and foremost, on your dietary needs. Don’t forget that options are available if you’re following a vegan,  gluten-free , low sugar, or keto diet.
It’s also a good idea to choose a product that’s free of artificial sweeteners and unnecessary additives and low in sugar, as these ingredients may contribute to digestive issues and weight gain ( 1 ,  15 ).
There’s nothing wrong with occasionally eating traditional full fat, full sugar  ice cream . But it’s best to enjoy it in moderation and to try to stick to the recommended serving size of 1/2–2/3 cup (approximately 50–100 grams).

Frequently asked questions
While these low fat, low calorie, and low sugar ice cream options sound delicious and appealing, it’s important to note that they typically contain artificial ingredients and fillers to make up for their nutrient reductions.
This means that, despite being  lower in calories , fat, or sugar, they tend to be high in artificial sweeteners, flavors, and colors.
Research shows that consuming large amounts of artificial sweeteners such as sugar alcohols — which are commonly found in sugar-free ice creams — can cause digestive issues like flatulence, abdominal discomfort, and increased bowel movements ( 1 ).
Therefore, ice creams perceived as healthier because of their reduced calorie and sugar content may end up leaving you with an upset stomach if consumed in large amounts.
However, they’re not harmful if consumed in moderation and may even be the healthiest choice for people following keto or  low sugar diets .
The healthiest ice cream for you will ultimately depend on your individual dietary needs.
Just remember to look for products made with high quality ingredients instead of focusing solely on their nutritional profile. Among the products mentioned on this list, reBLEND frozen smoothie shots tick all the boxes.
Lastly, keep in mind that ice cream is meant to be enjoyed in moderation, regardless of which variety you choose.
Determining a healthier substitute for ice cream will also depend on your dietary needs.
Countless homemade options made with high quality ingredients make excellent ice cream alternatives. For instance, if you’re looking for a dairy-free substitute, homemade frozen banana-based ice creams, often called “nice creams,” can be a rich and creamy dessert.
However, they wouldn’t be the most suitable choice for someone on a keto diet. Instead, homemade ice pops made with unsweetened coconut milk, vanilla extract, cacao powder, berries, and your favorite  nut butter  could be a delicious keto-friendly option.
Similarly, if you’re looking for a low fat, protein-rich option, you can try making homemade frozen treats using Greek yogurt and fruit.
Novel avocado-based ice creams, such as Cado, deliver heart-healthy fats instead of the  saturated fats  found in regular ice cream ( 16 ).
Avocados are a high fat food, which contributes to the rich and creamy consistency of these products.
However, their fat content consists primarily of  monounsaturated fatty acids , a heart-healthy type of fat. Avocados also contain zero cholesterol, are rich in fiber, and provide numerous beneficial plant compounds ( 16 ,  17 ).
Thanks to their nutritional content, avocados may help reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels and increasing HDL (good) cholesterol levels ( 16 ,  17 ).
Still, some avocado-based ice creams still contain their fair share of sugar, which, if consumed in excess, can increase the risk of weight gain and heart disease ( 18 ,  19 ).
Despite being perceived as a healthier option,  frozen yogurt  is not necessarily healthier than ice cream.
While frozen yogurt can be a source of protein and prebiotics, it can also be high in sugar and fat ( 20 ).
Also, frozen yogurt is often enjoyed with toppings such as candies and syrups, which can further increase its sugar content ( 21 ).
Feel free to enjoy frozen yogurt and ice cream from time to time. Just remember to do so in moderation since, much like other sweets, they should not account for more than 10% of your total daily calorie intake ( 20 ).

The bottom line
Although ice cream is usually high in sugar, fat, and calories, there are some great alternatives with more favorable nutrient profiles.
However, just because a dessert is organic, keto,  vegan , or dairy-free doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s lower in calories than traditional ice cream.
Furthermore, “healthy” ice cream is not meant to replace a balanced diet. Be mindful of how much ice cream you consume, and follow recommended serving sizes. Prioritize eating  balanced meals  to ensure your nutrient needs are being met.
Your best bet is to choose a flavor and brand that you truly enjoy — regardless of its calorie content — and to  stick to a single serving .
