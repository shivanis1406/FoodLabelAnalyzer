What is gluten-free bread?
Gluten is a group of proteins in wheat that is responsible for giving wheat bread its chewy, spongy texture ( 1 ,  2 ).
Because many people either need or choose to avoid gluten, gluten-free breads have become popular. These breads of made from different flours, such as rice or potato flour, and typically contain hydrocolloids like guar and xanthan gum, which help improve their texture ( 2 ).
Still, replicating the texture of typical bread is challenging. For this reason, gluten-free bread often has a bad reputation for being hard, dense, and crumbly. Many products are also low in fiber and contain large amounts of artificial additives.
However, several gluten-free options on the market are both tasty and nutritious and offer a great alternative to traditional breads for those who avoid gluten.

Gluten-free bread benefits
The most obvious benefit of gluten-free bread is that it allows people who cannot consume gluten to enjoy bread.
However, from a nutritional standpoint, many gluten-free breads contain fewer nutrients, such as protein and fiber, than wheat breads, which are often fortified with additional nutrients as well ( 3 ).
Unless you have celiac disease or another gluten-related disorder, there is likely no benefit to consuming gluten-free bread or avoiding gluten in your diet ( 4 ).

Comparing gluten-free breads

How to choose
When shopping for gluten-free bread, it’s important to consider how you plan on using it, your nutritional needs, and your preferences regarding taste and texture.
Additionally, if you’re on a strict  gluten-free diet  because of an allergy or intolerance, one of the most important things to look for is gluten-free certification.
According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), products can be labeled gluten-free only if they contain fewer than 20 parts per million of gluten, as this is the lowest level that can be reliably detected using scientifically validated methods ( 23 ).
However, while each company is required to test the gluten content of its products, the FDA does not currently enforce a set gluten testing standard that all companies must use.
Because of the lack of standardized testing methods and frequency, there are concerns over unintentional gluten exposure and cross contamination during processing.
As a result, some companies opt to have their products tested by third-party organizations such as GFCO.
In addition to testing for the amount of gluten present, GFCO inspects manufacturing facilities and requires products to be tested at least once per year.
Overall, choosing products that have been certified gluten-free can give you peace of mind about the safety of your bread.
Another aspect to consider is how you plan on using your bread. For example, if you prefer to make cold sandwiches, you may want to opt for a product that can be stored at room temperature rather than one that has to be thawed and toasted.
Ingredient-wise, look for products with an overall short ingredient list that consists mostly of whole grains and seeds, such as  quinoa , brown rice, or flaxseed. Try to avoid those with artificial additives or colors, as they’re likely to be more highly processed.
Depending on the type of toppings and fillings you plan on using, you may also want to look for breads that are higher in fiber and protein.
As with all breads, look for products that are lower in sugar and sodium. Also, keep in mind that many gluten-free breads can be higher in carbs, which may not fit into your diet if you’re following a lower carb eating plan.
Finally, if you’re concerned about potential pesticide levels on conventional grains, nuts, and seeds, go with a brand that has been certified organic by the USDA ( 24 ,  25 ).
When choosing a gluten-free bread, you may want to factor in its nutritional profile, its ingredients, and your intended use for it. If you are on a strict gluten-free diet, opt for products that are certified gluten-free by a third-party organization.

Frequently asked questions
There is no benefit to consuming gluten-free bread in place of traditional bread unless you have been diagnosed with celiac disease or another gluten-related disorder ( 4 ).
For those who cannot consume gluten, gluten-free bread is a fantastic alternative to gluten-containing bread.

Gluten-free bread is a great option for people with celiac disease who cannot consume gluten.
However, cross contamination with gluten particles can occur and be problematic, so those with celiac disease should choose only products that are certified gluten-free.

The bottom line
If you’re on a gluten-free diet, you likely understand how difficult it can be to find a bread that’s nutritious and has an enjoyable taste and texture.
When shopping for gluten-free bread, make sure to look for products that are certified gluten-free by a third-party organization.
It’s also important to consider the ingredient content, nutritional value, price, and storage time to find the bread product that best suits your needs.
