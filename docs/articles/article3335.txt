Title: Lutein and Zeaxanthin: Benefits, Dosage and Food Sources

Lutein and zeaxanthin are powerful antioxidants that promote eye health. Some fruits and vegetables, like kale, offer more lutein than carrots alone.
Lutein and zeaxanthin are two important carotenoids, which are pigments produced by plants that give fruits and vegetables a yellow or reddish hue.
Both are also potent antioxidants, offer a range of health benefits, and are best known for promoting eye health.
This article discusses the benefits of lutein and zeaxanthin, supplement dosages, safety, and food sources.

They’re important antioxidants
Lutein and zeaxanthin are powerful  antioxidants  that defend your body against unstable molecules that cause oxidative stress.
In excess, free radicals can damage your cells and contribute to aging and oxidative stress.  A 2022  review found oxidative stress may lead to the progression of:
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s
heart disease
chronic kidney disease
cancer
type 2 diabetes
obesity
Other characteristics from a  2020 review of carotenoids  include:
anti-inflammatory agent
immune system-boosting
increasing bone density
Lutein may also help prevent nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In both  human and animal studies , lutein was associated with a lower degree of:
NAFLD
total cholesterol
lipid accumulation
Lutein and zeaxanthin are important antioxidants, which protect your cells from free radicals and oxidative stress.

They support eye health
Lutein and zeaxanthin are dietary carotenoids that accumulate in the retina and human lens, particularly the macula region, which is located at the back of your eye.
The macula is essential for vision. Lutein and zeaxanthin are important antioxidants in this area, protecting your eyes from harmful free radicals. A  2020 research review  found that neutralizing these free radicals over time can protect your retina from photo-damage.
Lutein can also act as a natural sunblock by absorbing excess light energy. It’s thought to especially protect your eyes from harmful blue light, according to past  research .
Below are some conditions with which lutein and zeaxanthin may help:
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD):  Consumption of lutein and zeaxanthin may protect against AMD progression to blindness.
Cataracts:  Cataracts are cloudy patches at the front of your eye. Eating foods rich in lutein and zeaxanthin may slow their formation.
Diabetic retinopathy:  In both human and animal  diabetes studies , supplementing with lutein and zeaxanthin has been shown to enhance retinal function.
Retinal detachment:  Research on animals found improved retinal protection with lutein supplementation, according to a  2019 review .
Uveitis:  Uveitis is an inflammatory condition in the middle layer of the eye.  Research  supports that lutein may help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the uvea.
The research supporting the use of lutein and zeaxanthin in eye health is promising, but more research is needed before conclusions can be drawn about their applications.
Lutein and zeaxanthin may help improve or reduce the progression of many eye conditions, but research in this area is limited.

They may protect your skin
Lutein and zeaxanthin are found in human skin tissue.  Studies  suggest their antioxidant effects allow them to protect your skin from the sun’s damaging ultraviolet (UV) rays.
A  2020 clinical trial  of a mixed carotenoid supplement found increased skin carotenoid levels in the treatment group. Researchers also observed increased protection from UVB-induced erythema (sunburn) and UVA-induced pigmentation (skin hyperpigmentation).
In another  2020 clinical pilot study , postmenopausal women who consumed 85 g of Ataulfo mango — a source of lutein and zeaxanthin — showed improvements in facial wrinkles after 12 weeks. The study notes that mangoes are rich in beta-carotene and other carotenoids.
Lutein and zeaxanthin work as supportive antioxidants in your skin. They can protect it from sun damage and may help improve the appearance of wrinkles.

Lutein and zeaxanthin supplements
Lutein and zeaxanthin are recommended as dietary supplements to prevent vision loss or eye disease. These supplements are especially popular among older adults concerned about failing eye health.
Other people may benefit from lutein and zeaxanthin supplements, as  research  suggests dietary intakes of carotenoids are often low. Your body does not make lutein and zeaxanthin, so you must consume these nutrients in your diet.
Supplementing with lutein and zeaxanthin can also improve your overall antioxidant status, which may offer greater protection against stressors.
Talk with your doctor before starting any supplements, especially if you have any pre-existing health conditions and/or are on medications.
Lutein and zeaxanthin supplements have become very popular among people concerned with their eye health but may also benefit those with poor dietary intake.

Dosage
There is currently no recommended dietary intake for lutein and zeaxanthin. However, Americans consume an  average of 1–2 mg  of these nutrients daily. To reduce your risk of AMD, you may need much more than this .
Additionally, the amount of lutein and zeaxanthin your body requires may depend on why you are supplementing the nutrients and other stressors.
Some  studies  recommend a daily dosage of 10 mg lutein and 2 mg zeaxanthin.
10 mg of lutein and 2 mg of zeaxanthin appear to be effective in studies, but further research is needed to identify the optimal dosage for health.

Potential side effects and safety
There appear to be very few side effects associated with lutein and zeaxanthin supplements.
One human study  of 11 participants found that if taken at levels below 20 mg/day, lutein is likely safe. And no safety concerns were reported during a  2024 study  on children taking lutein and zeaxanthin supplements
But a  study from 2016  reported eye crystals in an older woman with glaucoma who took 20 mg/day of lutein for eight years. The woman also had a high dietary intake of lutein.
Lutein and zeaxanthin supplements are generally regarded as safe (GRAS) by the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) .
The European Food Safety Authority (ESFA) has approved a  1 mg/kg  body weight per day for lutein derived from marigold. The ESFA approved  0.75 mg/kg  body weight per day for synthetic zeaxanthin
Though lutein and zeaxanthin supplements have very few reported side effects, more research is needed to evaluate the potential side effects of very high intakes.
Lutein and zeaxanthin are overall safe to supplement at the recommended doses, but more research is required to assess the potential health effects.

Food sources
Lutein and zeaxanthin are found in great amounts in  leafy green vegetables , even though they also contribute to yellow and orange pigments.
Spinach is one of the best sources of lutein, with  7,450 mcg per 100 g . Lutein and zeaxanthin together total 7920 mcg per 100 g of spinach. Other key sources of these carotenoids  include :
kale
turnip greens
collards
mustard greens
Even more sources of lutein and zeaxanthin include:
summer squash
peas
pumpkin
Brussels sprouts
broccoli
sweet yellow corn
avocados
sweet red peppers
Egg yolks contain lutein that is highly bioavailable, or well absorbed into the body, though overall, their level of lutein is low.
Dark-green vegetables, such as kale, spinach, and broccoli, are fantastic sources of lutein and zeaxanthin. Foods like egg yolk, peppers, and sweet yellow corn are good sources, too.

The takeaway
Lutein and zeaxanthin are powerful antioxidant carotenoids found in yellow and orange fruits and vegetables, at high amounts in dark-green vegetables, and available in supplement form.
Although there is no official guidance on recommended dosing, most research suggests daily doses of 10 mg of lutein and 2 mg of zeaxanthin may be associated with positive health outcomes.
The FDA generally regards lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation as safe, but more research is needed to determine its health effects.
The average diet contains low amounts of these carotenoids, and the body can’t make them on its own. This may be just another good reason to increase your fruit and  vegetable intake .
