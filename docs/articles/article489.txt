Health benefits
Both broccoli and cauliflower have been linked to a number of potential health benefits.
Broccoli and cauliflower are both  rich in antioxidants , which are beneficial compounds that can decrease cell damage, reduce inflammation, and protect against chronic disease ( 5 ).
For example, sulforaphane and indole-3-carbinol are two sulfur-rich antioxidants commonly found in cruciferous vegetables like cauliflower and broccoli ( 6 ,  7 ).
Cauliflower is also a good source of several other antioxidants, including protocatechuic acid, coumaric acid, and vanillic acid ( 8 ).
Meanwhile, broccoli is high in lutein and zeaxanthin, both of which are important for  eye health  ( 9 ).
Broccoli and cauliflower each contain a concentrated amount of antioxidants, which could potentially help protect against certain types of cancer.
In fact, some research suggests that regular intake of cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower could be associated with a  lower risk of certain types of cancer  ( 10 ).
For instance, a study in 1,950 women found that eating more cruciferous vegetables was linked to a significantly lower risk of developing ovarian cancer ( 11 ).
Cruciferous vegetables have also been tied to a lower risk of stomach, breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer ( 12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 ).
Some research suggests that adding a few servings of broccoli or cauliflower to your diet may  improve heart health .
This is because both vegetables contain comparable amounts of fiber, an essential nutrient that can reduce cholesterol and blood pressure levels — both of which are risk factors for heart disease ( 17 ,  18 ).
Additionally, both are considered cruciferous vegetables, which are a family of vegetables that have been linked to a lower risk of heart disease ( 19 ).
What’s more, certain antioxidants in these vegetables, such as sulforaphane, have been shown to enhance heart health in some animal studies ( 20 ,  21 ).
Broccoli and cauliflower are both high in antioxidants and could improve heart health and protect against certain types of cancer.
