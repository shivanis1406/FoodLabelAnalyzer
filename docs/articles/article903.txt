Title: What to Eat After a Workout for Nutrition and Muscle Recovery

Eating foods containing carbs and protein may help support your muscles after exercise. Experts recommend eating shortly after your workout for the most benefit.
Consuming the right nutrients after exercise can help you optimize your fitness goals.
During exercise, your muscles  use up  their glycogen, which is the body’s preferred fuel source. This results in your muscles being partially depleted of glycogen. Some of the proteins in your muscles can also be broken down and damaged during exercise.
After your workout, your body rebuilds glycogen stores and regrows those muscle proteins.
However,  research  suggests that eating the right nutrients soon after exercising can help your body do this faster. Properly fuelling your body after exercise can also help:
decrease muscle protein breakdown
increase muscle protein synthesis (growth)
improve your mood
enhance recovery

Macronutrients for post-workout recovery
Macronutrients  are a group of nutrients your body needs in  large quantities  to provide the necessary energy it needs to function.
The three macronutrients are  protein ,  carbs , and  fat . These may each play a role in your body’s post-workout recovery process.
Exercise triggers the  breakdown  of muscle protein. The rate at which this happens depends on several factors, such as training volume, intensity, and frequency.
Consuming an  adequate amount of protein  throughout the day gives your body the  amino acids  it needs to repair and rebuild these proteins. It also gives you the building blocks required to build new muscle tissue.
The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) recommends consuming  20 to 40 grams (g)  of protein every 3 to 4 hours. This may help improve your exercise performance, muscle recovery, and body composition.
It’s also important to consume protein before and after exercise.
A  2017 study  found that eating protein pre-workout and post-workout has a similar effect on muscle strength, hypertrophy, and body composition changes.
Eating protein before exercise may also decrease the amount you need to eat after without affecting recovery.
However, if you’re specifically aiming to build muscle, the ISSN recommends eating high quality protein within the first  2 hours  after working out to stimulate the building blocks for new muscle tissue.
Your body’s glycogen stores are used as fuel during exercise, and consuming  carbs  after your workout helps  replenish  them.
The rate at which your glycogen stores are used depends on the activity.
For example,  endurance sports  cause your body to  use more  glycogen than  resistance training . For this reason, if you participate in endurance sports like cycling and running, you might need to consume more carbs than someone engaging in weightlifting.
The ISSN recommends eating a high carb diet of  3.6 to 5.5 g  of carbs per pound (8 to 12 g per kilogram [kg]) of body weight each day to help maximize your glycogen stores.
Furthermore, insulin secretion, which promotes glycogen synthesis, may be  better stimulated  when carbs and protein are consumed at the same time.
Within the first  4 hours  after working out, the ISSN recommends consuming 0.4 g of carbs per pound of body weight (0.8 g of carbs per kg) with 0.1 to 0.2 g of protein per pound of body weight (0.2 to 0.4 g of protein per kg) during each hour to help restore glycogen faster.
That said, these recommendations are targeted to the needs of endurance athletes. You may need less if you’re focusing on resistance training.
According to the ISSN,  not enough  evidence suggests whether you should limit fat intake after a workout.
Many people think that eating fat after a workout slows digestion and inhibits the absorption of nutrients. While fat might slow down the absorption of your post-workout meal, it may not reduce its benefits.
For example, a  2006 study  showed that whole milk was more effective at promoting muscle growth after a workout than skim milk.
Similarly, a  2017 study  found that eating whole eggs instead of egg whites was more effective at promoting muscle protein synthesis post-workout.
Having some fat in your post-workout meal may not affect your recovery. But more studies are needed on this topic.

The timing of your post-workout meal matters
The timing of your meals is important to maximize recovery and muscle growth because your body’s ability to rebuild glycogen and protein is enhanced after exercise.
Sports nutrition  researchers  have been studying nutrient timing for more than 40 years.
In the past, experts recommended eating your post-workout meal within  45 to 60 minutes . It was believed that delaying carb consumption by as little as 2 hours after a workout could lead to as much as  50%  lower rates of glycogen synthesis.
However, more  recent research  suggests the post-exercise window to maximize the muscular response to eating protein is wider than initially thought, up to as many as several hours.
Consuming a meal rich in whole carbs and protein before exercising may also increase your post-workout food intake window, as you may still feel some of the benefits of the pre-workout meal.

Foods to eat after you work out
The primary goal of your post-workout meal is to supply your body with the right nutrients for adequate recovery and maximize your workout’s benefits. Choosing easily digested foods will promote faster nutrient absorption.
The following table contains examples of high quality, easily digested foods:

Sample post-workout meals and snacks
Combinations of the foods above can create great meals that give you all the nutrients you need after exercise.
Here are some quick and easy meals to eat after your workout:
grilled chicken with roasted vegetables and rice
egg omelet with avocado spread on whole-grain toast
salmon with sweet potato
tuna salad sandwich on whole grain bread
whole-grain toast and almond butter
quinoa bowl with sweet potatoes, berries, and pecans
oatmeal , whey protein, banana, and almonds
Here are some delicious snacks to eat after your workout and throughout the day:
tuna and crackers
cottage cheese and fruits
pita and hummus
rice crackers and peanut butter
cereal with dairy or soy milk
Greek yogurt, berries, and granola
protein shake  and banana
whole grain crackers with string cheese and fruit

Make sure to drink plenty of water
Staying properly hydrated before and after your workout ensures the optimal internal environment for your body to maximize results.
During exercise, you lose  water  and  electrolytes  through sweat. Replenishing these after a workout can  help with  recovery, performance, and injury prevention.
The National Athletic Trainers’ Association (NATA) recommends drinking  500 to 600 ml  of water within 2 to 3 hours before exercising, and 200 to 300 ml within 10 to 20 minutes of exercising.
After exercising, the NATA recommends re-filling what you lost during your workout.

Frequently asked questions
Some foods to eat after exercising may include a combination of chicken, potatoes, fish, rice, fruits, vegetables, and plant-based proteins.
Research suggests that eating a  combination  of protein and carbs after exercising is the best way to maximize recovery, muscle growth, and injury prevention.
The ISSN recommends eating high quality proteins and carbs within  2 hours  of exercising.

Takeaway
Consuming the proper amount of carbs and protein after exercise is essential.
It stimulates muscle protein synthesis, improves recovery, and enhances performance during your next workout.
It’s important not to go much longer than a few hours before refueling with a meal or snack.
Finally, replenishing lost water and electrolytes can complete the picture and help you maximize the benefits of your workout.
