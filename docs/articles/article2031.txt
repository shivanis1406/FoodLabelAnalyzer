Author:  Angela Grassi, RDN, and Stephanie Mattei, PsyD

How to choose the best weight loss book
When shopping for a weight loss book, first consider your goals and preferences.
For instance, a cookbook may be an excellent choice if you’re looking for tips on  cooking healthy meals  at home. Or, if you learn best by doing, a workbook might be the best fit.
Some of these books may complement each other as well, so it may be helpful to read more than one.
Regardless of which book you choose, be sure to find one that’s evidence-based and doesn’t recommend an overly restrictive or potentially unsafe diet.
Instead, look for something that seems sustainable and realistic, so you can not only reach your goals but also  maintain them .

Other considerations for weight loss
Weight loss  comes from adjusting lifestyle habits, including nutrition, exercise, sleep, and more. Many of the books on our list discuss some or all of these strategies, but it’s important to find what works best for you in your day-to-day life.
Making lifestyle changes can be overwhelming. In addition to reading about weight loss, it can be beneficial to work with a healthcare professional, particularly a registered dietitian, who can help you set realistic goals and provide support and accountability.
Many health professionals, including registered dietitians, accept health insurance and Medicare or can adjust fees based on a sliding scale as needed to help make their services more affordable.

Frequently asked questions about weight loss books
While some books may provide valuable information and help you learn new tools and skills to be successful with losing weight, they won’t yield results on their own. In order for the book to be effective, you’ll need to implement the strategies you learn from your reading.
We recommend skipping weight loss books that encourage overly restrictive approaches to weight loss, such as diets that cut out entire food groups or promote eating unreasonably low calorie intakes.
It’s important to opt for books that use evidence-based approaches to weight loss and suggest realistic, sustainable lifestyle changes.
Research shows that a number of factors can play a role in successful weight loss. For example, setting realistic goals, keeping a food diary, and maintaining a good support system have all been found to be helpful in weight loss ( 7 ).
While there are many different diets and approaches to weight loss, the evidence shows that adherence to any diet, rather than the specifics of the diet itself, is what makes the difference in terms of success, so choosing an approach that feels sustainable for you is important ( 8 ).

The bottom line
There are countless weight loss books on the market, making it difficult to know which ones to choose or skip.
When shopping for a weight loss book, be sure to look for one that’s evidence-based and provides realistic advice. Keep in mind that you may need to read a few books before you find the one that works best for you.
Lastly, remember that weight loss books can’t replace individual guidance and treatment from a qualified health professional such as a registered dietitian.
