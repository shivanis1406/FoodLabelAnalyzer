Title: 17 Foods and Drinks for When You Have the Stomach Flu

When you have viral gastroenteritis, certain foods and drinks may help keep you nourished and soothe your stomach. These include ice chips, clear broths, and bland foods like bananas.
Scientifically, the stomach flu is known as viral gastroenteritis. It is a highly contagious infection that affects your stomach and intestines.
Norovirus results in an  estimated 21 million  cases yearly in the United States. Common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramping, and abdominal pain.
If you have stomach flu, certain foods and beverages may help settle your stomach, prevent further complications, and help you bounce back faster.
Here are 17 foods and drinks for when you have the stomach flu.

1. Ice chips
The  most common  complication of the stomach flu is dehydration.
When you have the stomach flu, it can be difficult to keep anything down, including water and other liquids. Though hydration is crucial when you have this virus, drinking too much at once may worsen  nausea  and vomiting.
Sucking on ice chips is a great place to start because it prevents you from consuming liquids too quickly. This may help you keep fluids down and stay better hydrated in the early stages of the stomach flu.

2. Clear liquids
Diarrhea and vomiting are  common symptoms  of the stomach flu. They can quickly lead to dehydration if you do not replace lost fluids.
Clear liquids mainly contain water, while some also have sugar. They are  usually easier  to digest than drinks like orange juice and milk, which are not considered clear liquids.
Clear liquids include:
water
broth
oral rehydration solutions, such as Pedialyte
herbal or decaffeinated teas
clear fruit juices, such as apple, cranberry, and grape juice
sports drinks
coconut water
Remember that fruit juices and sports drinks can be very high in sugar, so it’s important to avoid drinking too much of these beverages at once. Also, avoid giving them to infants and young children without professional guidance since they  may worsen  diarrhea.

3. Electrolyte beverages
Electrolytes  are a group of electrically charged minerals that aid critical bodily functions, such as blood pressure regulation and muscle contraction.
Replacing lost fluids and electrolytes is the cornerstone of stomach flu treatment.
At the first onset of diarrhea and vomiting, health professionals  often recommend  oral rehydration solutions, especially for infants and children. These contain water, sugar, and electrolytes in specific proportions that are easy to digest.
Sports drinks are another option to help replenish fluids and electrolytes, but are typically higher in sugar.  Researchers suggest  they may be as effective as oral rehydration solutions at treating adult dehydration.

4. Peppermint tea
Peppermint tea  may help relieve stomach flu symptoms. Just the smell of peppermint  may reduce  nausea.
In  one 2014 study  including 26 people who experienced nausea after surgery, smelling peppermint oil while doing deep breathing exercises helped relieve nausea.
While studies on the benefits of peppermint tea for stomach flu specifically are lacking, there is little to lose by trying it. At the very least, peppermint tea is a potential source of much-needed fluids when you have the stomach flu.

5. Ginger
Ginger  is commonly used to alleviate nausea, a primary symptom of the stomach flu.
Though research on ginger for nausea from the stomach flu specifically is lacking, studies have found that ginger helped reduce nausea due to  pregnancy ,  cancer treatment , and  motion sickness .
Ginger is available fresh, as a spice, or as an ingredient in teas, ginger ale, and candies.
Concentrated amounts of ginger can be found in syrups, capsules, and tinctures. However, it may be best to avoid concentrated sources because ginger may cause diarrhea in high doses.
Instead, try grating fresh ginger root into a soup or brewing it as a tea to relieve nausea if you have the stomach flu.

6. Broth-based soups
The  American College of Gastroenterology  recommends  broth  and broth-based soups as a first choice if you’re experiencing diarrhea and transitioning back to eating.
Broth-based soups have a very high water content, which can help with hydration during the stomach flu.
They’re also an excellent source of  sodium , an electrolyte that can quickly become depleted with frequent vomiting and diarrhea.
For example, 1 cup (240 mL) of a typical chicken noodle soup is about 90% water and  provides  roughly 32% of the average daily value (DV) for sodium.

7–10. Bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast
Bananas , rice, applesauce, and toast are the foundation of the BRAT diet. Health professionals recommend these bland foods for stomach complaints because they’re fairly gentle.
Remember that the BRAT diet alone will not give your body all the nutrients it needs.
The American Academy of Pediatrics  recommends  that children return to their usual age-appropriate diets as soon as they are rehydrated.
Nonetheless, bananas,  rice , applesauce, and toast are safe options when queasy from the stomach flu.

11–13. Dry cereal, crackers, and pretzels
Dry foods like cereal, plain crackers, and  pretzels  are also options. Since they’re free of spices, low in fat, and low in fiber, they’re gentle on your stomach.
They’re also made up of  simple carbs , which your body quickly and easily digests.
Moreover, these refined grains are often fortified with essential vitamins and minerals, which may help you get closer to meeting your daily nutrient needs while you have the stomach flu.

14. Plain potatoes
Bland foods like plain, boiled  potatoes  are great options when you have the stomach flu.
Plain potatoes are soft, low in fat, and made up of easily digestible starches. They’re also loaded with potassium, one of the primary electrolytes lost from vomiting and diarrhea.
Just 1 medium potato, or 167 grams (g),  provides  about 12% of the DV for  potassium .
Avoid adding high fat toppings, such as butter, cheese, and sour cream. These can worsen diarrhea. Instead, consider seasoning your potatoes with a dash of salt because sodium can become depleted during the stomach flu.

15. Eggs
Eggs are a nutritious choice when you have the stomach flu.
When prepared with minimal added fat, dairy, and spices,  eggs  are easy on your stomach.
They’re also an excellent source of protein, with 6 g per large egg, and  provide  other nutrients, like B vitamins and  selenium , which is a mineral that’s  important  for your immune system.
Avoid frying eggs in oil, butter, or lard, as high fat  may worsen  your diarrhea.

16. Low-fat poultry and meat
Your body may better tolerate  lean poultry and meats  than high fat options when you have the stomach flu. Lean choices include:
skinless, white-meat cuts of chicken and turkey
extra-lean ground chicken, turkey, and beef
low fat cold cuts (lunch meat), such as chicken, turkey, and ham
extra-lean cuts of beef, such as top sirloin and eye of round steak
pork chops with the fat trimmed off
Avoid frying the meat and instead opt for baking, roasting, or grilling to help keep the fat content low and prevent making your upset stomach worse.

17. Fruit
When you have the stomach flu, replenishing fluids is a top priority.
Beverages aren’t the only option for hydration. In fact, many fruits are 80–90% water. The following are some of the fruits  highest in water :
watermelon
strawberries
cantaloupe
peaches
Fruits also provide abundant vitamins and minerals, such as potassium and vitamins A and C.
However, many whole fruits are high in fiber, making them difficult to digest. Cooked fruits like applesauce may be easier to tolerate.

Food and drinks to avoid
Some foods and beverages may worsen nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and other stomach flu symptoms. Consider avoiding the following:
Caffeinated beverages:   Caffeine  can  impair  sleep quality, which may get in the way of recovery. Coffee stimulates your digestion and may  worsen  diarrhea.
High fat and fried foods:  High-fat foods are more difficult to digest and  may lead  to diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Spicy foods:  Spicy foods  may trigger  nausea and vomiting in some people.
Sugary foods and beverages:   High sugar  may worsen diarrhea, especially in children.
Milk and milk products:  When sick with the stomach flu, some people  have trouble  digesting lactose, a sugar in milk and milk products. In some cases, this side effect can last up to a month or more.

The bottom line
When you have the stomach flu, keeping down foods and beverages can be difficult.
Ice chips, clear liquids, and electrolyte beverages are good places to start. They can help you replenish fluids and electrolytes.
Until you can tolerate your usual diet, bland options like soups, refined grains, and plain potatoes are safer choices. Eggs and unsweetened applesauce may also be easier to digest.
Allowing your body to rest, staying hydrated, and trying some foods on this list may help you recover more quickly.
