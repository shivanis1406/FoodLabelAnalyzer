Title: Can Oat Straw Extract Improve Your Health?

Oat straw extract is believed to offer numerous health benefits, such as reduced inflammation and improved brain function and mood.
Oat straw comes from the unripened  Avena sativa  plant, which is commonly grown in Northern Europe and North America.
As an extract, oat straw is often sold as a tincture but can also be found in powder and capsule form.
This article reviews oat straw extract and its potential benefits.

What is oat straw extract?
Avena sativa , or common oat, is a species of cereal grass known for its highly nutritious seeds.
While its mature seeds are what become the  oats  you buy, oat straw extract comes from its stems and leaves, which are harvested earlier while the grass is still green.
Oat straw extract goes by many names, including green oat and wild oat extracts.
It’s high in  iron , manganese, and zinc, though its nutrient composition can vary by brand.
The extract is claimed to offer many health benefits, including improvements in brain health, insomnia, stress, and physical and sexual performance. However, not all of these benefits are supported by research.

Potential benefits
While many benefits have been linked to oat straw extract, only a few have been studied.
Impaired blood flow is a risk factor for heart disease and stroke.
Green oat extract contains a unique group of antioxidants called avenanthramides, which have been shown to improve heart health.
In particular, they may  improve blood flow  by increasing the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that helps dilate blood vessels.
One  24-week study  in 37 older adults with excess weight found that supplementing with 1,500 mg of oat straw extract daily significantly improved measures of blood flow in the heart and brain, compared with a placebo.
While research shows that oat straw extract may help maintain a  healthy heart , more long-term studies are needed to fully understand its effects.
Chronic inflammation  has been shown  to increase your risk of conditions like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.
Oat straw extract is rich in many antioxidants, including avenanthramides, which  have been shown  to help  reduce inflammation , thereby decreasing your risk of these illnesses.
Additionally,  test-tube studies  indicate that avenanthramides from oats can reduce the production and secretion of cytokines, which are proinflammatory compounds that are linked to an increased risk of heart disease and other chronic conditions.
Oat straw extract may help  boost brain function  in older adults.
One study  in middle-aged adults with impaired memory found that supplementing with 800–1,600 mg of green oat extract significantly improved memory, attention, and concentration.
A  newer study  confirmed these results, as well as determining that the supplement decreased the subjects’ physical response to stress.
However, these studies were funded by the company that created the supplement, which may have influenced these findings.
An  older 12-week study  in 36 healthy adults with normal brain function observed that supplementing with 1,500 mg of green oat extract daily did not change measures of attention, memory, task focus, accuracy, or multi-tasking performance.
Overall, current research on oat straw extract and brain function is limited, and it has not been shown to benefit adults with normal brain function.
Traditionally, oat straw extract has been used to  relieve stress , anxiety, and depression.
While research is limited,  some studies  suggest that the extract may improve mood by inhibiting the enzyme phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4), which is found in immune cells.
Research   suggests  that inhibiting PDE4 may reduce stress,  anxiety , and depression.
Additionally, oat straw extract may reduce levels of proinflammatory cytokines, which may be involved in the development of depression and other psychiatric disorders.
One  2009 rat study  found that a low dose of green oat extract over seven weeks significantly improved the animals’ ability to cope and react to stress, compared with a placebo.
However, these results have not been replicated in humans.

Potential adverse effects
Oat straw extract has not been linked to any major side effects or medication interactions, but research on its safety is limited.
Additionally, the extract has not been studied in children or women who are  pregnant  or nursing, so it’s unclear whether this supplement is safe to use in these populations.
Like any supplement, consult your healthcare provider before taking oat straw extract to ensure proper safety.
What’s more, while oat straw is  naturally gluten-free , there may be a risk of cross-contamination during processing. Those needing to avoid gluten should only buy oat straw extract that is certified gluten-free.

How to take oat straw extract
Oat straw extract can be purchased online and from health food stores.
You can find it in a variety of forms, including capsules, powders, and  tinctures .
Research  indicates that dosages of 800–1,600 mg per day are most effective.
Still, dosing amounts can vary by product and individual needs.
Additionally, research on its safety and efficacy is limited. More human studies are needed to determine safe dosing recommendations and whether the extract is effective.
While oat straw extract is considered safe for most people, it’s best to discuss its use with your healthcare provider.

The bottom line
Oat straw extract comes from the stems and leaves of the unripened  Avena sativa  plant.
Human studies indicate that it may improve brain function in older adults and heart health.
Moreover, test-tube and animal studies suggest that it may reduce chronic inflammation and  boost mood .
While these potential benefits are promising, more research is needed to understand its full effect in humans.
