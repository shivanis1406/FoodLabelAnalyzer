Plant compounds
Spinach contains several important plant compounds, including ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10 ):
Lutein.  This compound is linked to improved  eye health .
Kaempferol.  This antioxidant may decrease your risk of cancer and chronic diseases.
Nitrates.  Spinach contains high amounts of nitrates, which may promote heart health.

Zeaxanthin.  Like lutein, zeaxanthin can also improve eye health.
Spinach boasts many plant compounds that can improve health, such as lutein, kaempferol, nitrates, quercetin, and zeaxanthin.

Health benefits of spinach
Spinach is extremely healthy and linked to numerous health benefits.
It has been shown to improve oxidative stress, eye health, and blood pressure.
Free radicals are byproducts of metabolism. They can cause oxidative stress, which triggers accelerated aging and increases your risk of cancer and diabetes ( 11 ).
However, spinach contains  antioxidants , which fight oxidative stress and help reduce the damage it causes.
One study in eight healthy people found that spinach helped prevent oxidative damage. Although this study was quite small, its findings are backed up by other animal and human research ( 12 ,  13 ,  14 ).
Spinach is rich in  zeaxanthin and lutein , which are the carotenoids responsible for color in some vegetables.
Human eyes also contain high quantities of these pigments, which protect your eyes from the damage caused by sunlight ( 15 ).
Additionally, several studies indicate that zeaxanthin and lutein work to prevent macular degeneration and cataracts, which are major causes of blindness ( 16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  19 ).
These compounds may even be able to reverse existing damage ( 20 ,  21 ).
Spinach contains two components, MGDG and SQDG, which may slow down cancer growth.
In one study, these compounds helped slow tumor growth in a person’s cervix. They also decreased the size of the tumor ( 22 ,  23 ).
Several human studies link spinach consumption to a reduced risk of prostate cancer. Eating this leafy green may also help prevent breast cancer ( 24 ,  25 ).
Likewise, one animal study notes that spinach might suppress cancer formation ( 26 ).
Additionally, spinach packs high amounts of antioxidants, which may also  fight cancer  ( 27 ).
Spinach contains high amounts of  nitrates , which have been shown to help moderate blood pressure levels and decrease your risk of heart disease ( 28 ,  29 ).
One study in 27 people found that eating spinach effectively lowered blood pressure levels. Several other studies observed similar effects, indicating that spinach boosts  heart health  ( 7 ,  30 ,  31 ).
Spinach has a host of benefits. It may reduce oxidative stress, promote eye health, fight cancer, and regulate blood pressure.

Potential downsides
Spinach is generally considered very healthy. However, it may cause adverse effects in some individuals.
Kidney stones  are caused by acid and mineral salt buildup. The most common variety is calcium stones, which consist of calcium oxalate.
Spinach is high in both calcium and  oxalates , so people who are at a high risk of developing kidney stones should limit their intake ( 32 ,  33 ).
Spinach is  high in vitamin K1 , which serves several functions in your body but is best known for its role in blood clotting.
As such, it could interfere with blood-thinning medication. People who are taking blood thinners, such as warfarin, should consult with their healthcare practitioner before eating large amounts of spinach ( 34 ).
People who are prone to kidney stones may want to avoid spinach. This leafy green is also very high in vitamin K1, which can be a problem for people on blood thinners.

The bottom line
Spinach is a nutritious,  leafy green .
This vegetable has been shown to benefit health in several ways.  Spinach  may decrease oxidative stress, improve eye health, and help prevent heart disease and cancer.
If you’re interested in its health-boosting potential, spinach is an easy food to add to your diet.
