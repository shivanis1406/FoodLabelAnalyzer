Title: Does Weightlifting Help Women Lose Weight?

Weightlifting, along with a nutritious diet, can help you lose weight. Contrary to popular belief, weightlifting won’t make you bulky if you’re a woman.
If you’re looking to lose weight, you may wonder which type of workout will best help you shed those pounds, and you may have looked into  weightlifting  for women.
Weightlifting — also known as resistance training — was once reserved for bodybuilders due to the myth that lifting weights makes you look bulky, but becoming bulky as a woman is difficult.

Does weightlifting help you lose weight?
To lose weight and burn fat, you need to be in a  calorie deficit , which can be achieved in three main ways:
eating fewer calories per day than you need
burning more calories through exercise than you consume
a combination of both
Though lifting weights burns calories, it’s not the most efficient way to do so.
Cardiorespiratory  training, also known as cardio — which includes running, cycling, and swimming —  burns more calories  per workout session than weight training.
Weightlifting supports weight loss by building muscle mass. Muscles are  metabolically efficient  and  burn more calories  at rest than fat. It’s typically best to add both weight training and  cardio  to your workout regimen.
Research  also suggests that weight training increases metabolic rate, meaning you burn additional calories hours after your workout has ended.
When you lose weight, you’re not losing pure fat — rather, you’re losing:
fat mass
glycogen stores
muscle
Weight training helps  preserve muscle mass  during weight loss, thus increasing fat loss and keeping your metabolism from changing too much.
Overall, weight training,  cardio , and a balanced diet are great ways to support weight loss.

Does weightlifting make you bulky?
While you can build muscle with weightlifting, to build substantial muscle mass, you need to  lift heavy weights  and eat more calories than you burn — and even then, it can take months to years.
Further, women typically have lower levels of  anabolic  (muscle-building) hormones such as testosterone and growth hormone, making it  harder to gain muscle mass .
Also affecting the rate and extent to which you can build muscle are  factors  such as:
genetics
diet
body type
exercise load
volume of exercise
intensity of exercise

Other benefits of weightlifting
Weight training provides numerous other benefits in addition to weight loss.
Muscle is denser than fat, meaning it takes up less space on your body. As you build muscle and lose fat, you will naturally appear  leaner  and smaller.
Although weight training will contribute to fat loss, depending on your starting weight and  goals , you may not see a large change in the number on the scale right away.
Contrary to popular belief, you can’t tone your muscles, but building muscles and losing fat showcases muscle definition, creating a stronger, leaner look.
Gaining strength makes daily activities like carrying groceries and keeping up with your kids easier. Plus, it  lowers your risk of falls  and injuries since you’re better able to support your body.
Weight training is also crucial for  bone development  because it temporarily stresses bones, signaling the body to  rebuild them stronger . This can  reduce the risk  of osteoporosis and fractures, especially as you age.
Weight training can  reduce your risk  of chronic diseases such as:
type 2 diabetes
heart disease
sarcopenia
Adding both resistance training and cardio to your workout routine may boost your  cardiorespiratory health  even more.
Both forms of exercise provide many  benefits , including improved heart health, increased lung capacity, and more muscle mass.

How to start
It’s best to speak with a healthcare professional before starting a new workout regimen to make sure the plan is right for you.
Most experts recommend 3–5 weight training sessions per week, along with days allotted for cardio and rest. If you can fit in only 2–3 training sessions per week, you can still achieve results. Just focus on good form and make sure your workouts challenge you.
The number of sessions depends on factors such as:
training volume
intensity
recovery days needed
your schedule
More exercise isn’t always better. The quality of your workouts is more important than the quantity.
Here’s an example of a one-week exercise routine:
Monday:  upper body training ( arms ,  shoulders ,  back )
Tuesday:  active recovery  day, including cardio ( walking ,  running ,  cycling ,  swimming )
Wednesday:  lower body training ( glutes ,  quads ,  hamstrings )
Thursday:  active recovery, including cardio (walking, running, cycling, swimming) and a  core workout
Friday:  optional training day (lower body or upper body training)
Saturday:  full-body  high intensity interval training (HIIT)
Sunday:  rest day with light stretching or a light workout (like  yoga  or  Pilates )
You can also combine workouts, such as upper body and core, into one day if you can’t fit as many training days in.
While you can weight train every day, you should allow  48 hours of recovery  per muscle group. For example, if you train your back and shoulders on Monday, try to wait until at least Wednesday before training them again.
While it may feel good to lie down when you’re sore, try getting up and moving a bit. This allows your muscles to rest while encouraging blood flow and active recovery. Light stretching or  yoga  can also help if you’re very sore after your workout.
Remember to listen to and respect your body, and know your limits. The best  exercise  is exercise that you can sustain long term.
If you want more guidance, consider working with a  physical trainer , who can provide personalized recommendations to help you reach your goals.

Nutrition
While weightlifting can support weight loss, paying attention to your nutrition is another important factor. Weightlifting burns calories, but you’ll need to  pair it with a suitable diet  to achieve noticeable weight loss.
You can reach a calorie deficit by exercising regularly and eating slightly fewer calories.  Research  has consistently found this an effective, sustainable strategy for weight loss.
What’s more, if you’re looking to build muscle and strength, it’s important to  refuel your body  with adequate protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats.
Though it depends on your goals, your body size, and other factors, most people should aim to get  20–40 grams  of  protein  per meal or around  0.6–0.9 grams per pound  (1.4–2.0 grams per kg) of body weight per day to maintain muscle during weight loss.
In addition, make sure to include foods containing  fiber  and  complex carbs  in your diet to properly fuel your workouts and recovery. These foods are high in beneficial nutrients and can help keep you  feel full longer .

The takeaway
Weightlifting is beneficial for women at any age and won’t make you bulky. Rather, it can help create a lean, stronger look.
It helps you build strength and  muscle , reduces your risk of chronic diseases, and promotes weight loss.
A workout regimen that includes weight training days targeting various muscle groups, cardio, and a nutritious diet with adequate protein will support your weight loss efforts.
While most experts recommend aiming for 3–5 weight training sessions per week, incorporating any weight training into your exercise regimen will be beneficial.
