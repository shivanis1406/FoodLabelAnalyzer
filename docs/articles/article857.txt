Title: Lemons vs. Limes: What’s the Difference?

Limes are small, green, and more tart than lemons, which are larger, oval-shaped, and yellow. Nutritionally, they’re almost identical and share many of the same potential health benefits.
Lemons and limes are some of the most popular citrus fruits in the world.
Though they have a lot in common, they’re also distinctly different.
This article reviews the main similarities and differences between lemons and limes — so you’ll know exactly what to do when life hands you one of them.

What are lemons and limes?
Lemons and limes are two kinds of fruit that — though genetically different — are closely related.
Some experts believe that lemons were created as a hybrid of lime and citron — a large, thick-rinded citrus fruit. However, this is merely one of many origin theories ( 1 ).
Both lemons and limes — as well as oranges, tangerines, citron, and  grapefruit  — belong to the broader category of citrus fruit.
Lemons and limes are now grown all over the world. Yet, lemons — formally known as  Citrus limon  — are typically grown in moderate climates, while limes — or  Citrus aurantifolia  — grow better in tropical and subtropical regions ( 1 ).
Both fresh and processed forms of lemons and limes are utilized in a number of different industries.
These two fruits are well known for their acidic, sour flavor and featured in a variety of culinary applications around the world. They may be used in cooking, food preservation, or simply to impart flavor.
The  essential oils  of lemons and limes are often used for cosmetic and medicinal purposes. They’re also included in many household cleaning products for their fragrance and antibacterial properties.

Have a lot in common
Though lemons and limes are distinctly different fruits, they share many of the same characteristics — especially when it comes to their nutritional value and potential health benefits.
A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of either fruit provides the following nutrients ( 2 ):
In terms of their macronutrient content — carbs, protein, and fat — lemons and limes are essentially identical with limes taking an insignificant lead in carb and calorie content.
Lemons provide more  vitamin C  than limes — but both make a significant dietary contribution of this vitamin.
Overall, lemons offer a slightly greater quantity of vitamins and minerals, including potassium, folate, and vitamin B6.
Traditional herbal medicine practices have been known to utilize citrus fruits — like lemons and limes — for their medicinal benefits ( 3 ).
Vitamin C — one of the main nutrients found in these citrus fruits — is well known for its antioxidant properties and plays a major role in sustaining a healthy  immune system  ( 4 ).
Citrus fruits also contain many other plant compounds with known antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties ( 3 ).
Multiple studies suggest that these compounds may play a role in preventing heart disease and certain types of cancer, including breast and colon cancer ( 3 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
One study in mice observed that citric acid — a specific compound found in citrus fruits — has a protective effect against inflammation in the brain and liver ( 8 ).
However, research on the potential medicinal and pharmacological benefits of lemons and limes is currently limited to animal and test-tube studies.
Ultimately, more research is needed to determine whether these fruits can effectively treat conditions in humans.
Lemons and limes are similar in their nutritional makeup. They also contain many of the same plant compounds that may play a role in reducing inflammation and preventing certain diseases.

Different Taste and Appearance
While lemons and limes have many similarities, they have some distinct differences as well.
Perhaps one of the most obvious differences between lemons and limes is their appearance.
Lemons are usually bright yellow, while limes are typically a bright shade of green. However, certain types of limes will turn yellow as they ripen, making the distinction a little more difficult.
Limes are also smaller and rounder than lemons. They can vary in size but are usually 1–2 inches (3–6 centimeters) in diameter.
In comparison,  lemons  tend to be 2–4 inches (7–12 centimeters) in diameter and have a more oval or oblong shape.
In terms of flavor, these two citrus fruits are similar. They’re both tart, and eating either fruit by itself is likely to result in the same puckered facial expression.
However, lemons tend to err on the side of slightly sweet, whereas limes are usually more  bitter .
Limes are sometimes described as being sourer than lemons, but this may have more to do with its bitterness. This perception also varies depending on your individual taste.
Lemons are typically sweeter and larger than limes, whereas limes are small and slightly more bitter.

Slightly different culinary uses
When it comes to cooking, both  citrus fruits  are used in similar ways.
Both make excellent additions to salad dressings, sauces, marinades, beverages, and cocktails. Which one you choose will likely be based on the dish’s flavor profile.
Since limes are more bitter, they’re often reserved for savory dishes, whereas the sweetness of lemons lends itself to broader applications in both savory and sweet dishes.
Keep in mind that this is not a hard and fast rule — there are always exceptions. For instance, lime is the featured ingredient in certain sweet beverages like margaritas or limeade. It can also be found in desserts like key lime pie.
Still, generally speaking, you’re more likely to see lemons in sweet dishes rather than limes.
These two types of citrus fruit can safely be used interchangeably in a variety of cooking scenarios without ruining the dish — but it’s important to keep the bitter-sweet flavor balance in mind.
While neither choice is wrong, one of them may be better than the other, depending on your particular dish.
In the kitchen, lemons and limes are often used in the same way. However, limes are not as frequently used in sweet dishes due to their bitterness.

The bottom line
Lemons and limes are two popular citrus fruits that come with a variety of options for culinary, medicinal, and practical applications.
Limes are small, round, and green, while lemons are usually larger, oval-shaped, and bright yellow.
Nutritionally, they’re almost identical and share many of the same potential health benefits.
Both fruits are acidic and sour, but lemons tend to be sweeter, while limes have a more bitter flavor. These flavor differences typically drive their different culinary uses.
