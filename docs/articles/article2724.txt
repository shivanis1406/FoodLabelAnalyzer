Title: What's the Best Way to Grind Flax Seeds?

Flax seeds are tiny seeds that are packed with nutrients.
They’re a great plant-based source of antioxidants, protein, fiber, and anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids ( 1 ,  2 ).
However, whole flax seeds have a tough outer hull that keeps them from breaking down in your digestive tract. To get the most benefits, it’s best to eat ground flax seeds ( 3 ).
Ground flax seeds are available to purchase at grocery stores or online. Still, if you want to grind your own flax seeds, there are many ways to do so.
This article reviews the best ways to grind flax seeds.

Blender or food processor
You can use a blender or food processor to grind flax seeds. Many people have at least one of these appliances at home.
To grind  flax seeds  with a blender, add 1 cup (149 grams) of flax seeds to the device and blend for a few minutes, or until the flax is ground to your desired consistency.
With a food processor, add at least 1 cup (149 grams) of flax seeds and grind until they reach your desired consistency. This may take several minutes.
However, using a blender or food processor is time-consuming, and you have to grind large amounts at once. Other methods allow you to grind small batches.
Flax seeds can be ground using a blender or food processor, but you have to grind in batches of at least 1 cup (149 grams) at a time.

Coffee grinder
Using a  coffee  grinder is the easiest, most convenient way to grind flax seeds.
Coffee grinders are relatively inexpensive, as well as quick and efficient.
To grind flax seeds in this way, add whole seeds up to the fill level of a coffee grinder that you specifically use for flax seeds and power it on. It should only take a few seconds for the seeds to be fully ground.
Additionally, using a coffee grinder allows you to only grind the amount you need — helping to limit waste.

By hand
There are also some tools you can use to grind flax seeds by hand.
One is a flax mill, which is a specialized kitchen tool made solely for grinding flax by hand. It looks like a  pepper  grinder.
In fact, you can even use a pepper grinder to grind flax seeds once it has been emptied and cleaned so that no pepper residue remains.
Finally, you can use a mortar and pestle to grind flax seeds by hand. Use the pestle (the club-shaped object) to crush the flax seeds against the mortar (the bowl) to grind them.
These options allow you to grind up to 1 tablespoon of flax seeds at a time. However, they’re more time-consuming and less effective than using a coffee grinder.

Storage
No matter which grinding method you choose, ground flax seeds can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week ( 4 ).
Therefore, you should only grind the amount you think you’ll be able to use within that time.
Ground flax seeds should taste earthy and slightly nutty. If they taste bitter, they’re likely rancid and should be thrown away.

The bottom line

Still, a blender, food processor, pepper grinder, flax mill, or mortar and pestle can also accomplish the task.
Grinding your own flax seeds is a simple process that can help you experience their many health benefits.
