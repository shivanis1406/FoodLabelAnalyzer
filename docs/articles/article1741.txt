Benefits
There may be several benefits associated with Kendall Jenner’s diet and exercise regimen.
Jenner’s diet is flexible and easy to follow.
Unlike other diet plans, it doesn’t set strict rules and allows you to enjoy a variety of different foods so that you won’t feel deprived. Not only can this be easier to stick to long term, but it could also help prevent  overeating  ( 1 ,  2 ).
It also encourages several nutritious foods, including whole grains, lean meat, and vegetables.
These foods are rich in protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, all of which play a key role in overall health ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
Protein promotes muscle growth and keeps you feeling full between meals, while fiber supports digestive health and regularity ( 3 ,  4 ,  6 ).
Meanwhile, vitamins and minerals play a key role in everything from DNA synthesis to energy production, brain function, immunity, and more ( 5 ,  7 ).
Jenner’s diet involves drinking plenty of water and detox tea to stay well-hydrated.
Studies show that  drinking enough water  could help you eat less food, temporarily boost your metabolism, and increase weight loss — especially if you start drinking water in place of sugar-sweetened beverages like soda or juice ( 8 ,  9 ,  10 ).
In addition to supporting weight loss, it may prevent side effects of dehydration like headaches, dry skin, muscle cramps, and fatigue ( 8 ,  11 ).
What’s more, staying well-hydrated can improve regularity, support digestive health, and prevent issues like constipation ( 12 ).
Regular exercise is another important part of Jenner’s routine.
Studies have linked regular physical activity with a long list of health benefits. For example, it may improve symptoms of depression, enhance heart health, protect against chronic disease, and help you live longer ( 13 ).
One small study in inactive adults also found that bodyweight training significantly  improved cardiorespiratory fitness , which is how well your heart and lungs provide oxygen to your muscles during exercise ( 14 ).
Additionally, some research suggests that exercising in the morning may be more effective for improving body composition, enhancing blood sugar control, and decreasing appetite, compared with exercising at other times of day ( 15 ,  16 ).
Kendall Jenner’s diet is flexible and not overly restrictive. It encourages several nutritious foods and emphasizes the importance of hydration and regular physical activity.

Potential downsides
Even though Kendall Jenner has provided details about her diet and exercise plan in interviews, there are no official specific guidelines on how to follow her diet. Therefore, it’s not the best option if you prefer structured plans with detailed guidance.
If you have a difficult time moderating your intake of these foods, you may find the plan challenging, as it allows processed foods like pizza, pasta, and sweets.
What’s more, following Jenner’s exercise regimen can be expensive and may not be suitable if you’re on a tight budget. Besides working with a personal trainer, she takes regular fitness classes that can cost $10–$30 per class or more for private sessions.
Finally, Jenner has noted in some interviews that she drinks up to 12 cups (2.8 liters) of  detox tea  per day. Although it’s unclear which type of detox tea she drinks, some varieties contain caffeine or laxatives, which could be harmful in high amounts ( 17 ,  18 ).
In fact, some case reports have linked certain herbal supplements, including detox teas, to liver failure and electrolyte imbalances ( 19 ,  20 ,  21 ).
Furthermore, no research supports the use of detox teas or cleanses for weight management or eliminating toxins from your body ( 22 ).
Kendall Jenner’s diet and exercise regimen don’t provide specific guidelines and can be expensive to follow. She also drinks multiple cups of detox tea per day, which could be harmful.

Should you try it?
Kendall Jenner’s diet is simple, easy to follow, and not overly restrictive. It encourages many nutritious foods, getting regular exercise, and drinking plenty of water, all of which could benefit your health.
It also limits dairy products like milk and cheese, which have been linked to increased acne in some studies ( 23 ,  24 ,  25 ).
However, if you’re looking to lose weight or improve your health, there may be better options out there, including evidence-based dietary plans like plant-based diets and the Mediterranean diet ( 26 ,  27 ).
For example, the Mediterranean diet has been associated with a lower risk of heart disease and  cancer . Meanwhile, plant-based diets could help reduce inflammation, protect against chronic disease, and support gut health ( 26 ,  27 ).
These diets also emphasize nutrient-dense foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and provide clearer guidelines about which ingredients to limit in your diet.
It’s also worth keeping in mind that some components of Jenner’s diet and workout plan can be expensive. Plus, they may not be suitable for everyone.
For instance, while her schedule encourages regular physical activity, most people benefit from a combination of cardio and resistance training rather than bodyweight exercises alone.
It’s recommended to aim for at least 150–300 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week or 75–150 minutes of vigorous physical activity. Muscle strengthening activities, such as lifting weights, are also recommended at least twice per week for healthy adults ( 28 ).
Furthermore, drinking large amounts of detox tea could be harmful, especially if you’re drinking a variety that contains ingredients like caffeine or laxatives.
Therefore, it’s best to limit your intake of detox tea and talk with a doctor before using herbal supplements, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medications.
Even though Kendall Jenner’s diet has several potential benefits, there are many other diet plans with research-backed health benefits and clearer guidelines. Furthermore, drinking large amounts of detox tea could be harmful.

The bottom line
While Kendall Jenner doesn’t follow any specific eating pattern, she has opened up about her diet and workout plan in many interviews.
In addition to exercising regularly and eating foods like whole grains, proteins, and veggies, she also eats snacks throughout the day and enjoys foods like pizza, pasta, and  sushi  in moderation.
She also works out regularly, incorporating a variety of bodyweight exercises and fitness classes into her routine.
Although Jenner’s diet may be a good fit for some, it can also be expensive and doesn’t offer specific guidelines for which foods to eat and avoid. It also involves drinking large amounts of detox tea, which might do more harm than good when it comes to your health.
Ultimately, it’s best to talk with a healthcare professional to find a diet and exercise plan tailored to your preferences, goals, and health.
