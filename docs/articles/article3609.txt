Title: 9 Proven Ways to Lose Weight Without Diet or Exercise

Some practices like chewing slowly and eating more fiber may help you lose weight without exercise or a specific diet plan.
Sticking to a conventional diet and exercise plan can be difficult.
However, there are several proven tips that can help you eat fewer calories with ease.
These are effective ways to reduce your weight, as well as to prevent weight gain in the future.
Here are 9 ways to lose weight without diet or exercise, all of which are based on science.

1. Chew thoroughly and slow down
Your brain needs time to process that you’ve had enough to eat.
Chewing your food thoroughly makes you  eat more slowly , which is associated with decreased food intake, increased fullness, and smaller portion sizes ( 1 ,  2 ).
How quickly you finish your meals may also affect your weight.
A review of eight studies reported that people who didn’t eat quickly had a significantly lower body mass index (BMI) than fast eaters ( 3 ).
To get into the habit of eating more slowly, it may help to count how many times you chew each bite.
Eating your food slowly can help you feel more full with fewer calories. It is an easy way to lose weight and prevent weight gain.

2. Use smaller plates for high calorie foods
The typical food plate is larger today than it was a few decades ago.
This trend could contribute to weight gain, since using a smaller plate may help you eat less by making portions look larger.
On the other hand, a bigger plate can make a serving look smaller, causing you to add more food ( 4 ,  5 ).
You can use this to your advantage by serving nutrient-dense,  lower calorie foods  on bigger plates and high calorie foods on smaller plates.
Smaller plates can trick your brain into thinking you’re eating more than you actually are. Therefore, it’s smart to consume higher calorie foods from smaller plates, causing you to eat less.

3. Eat plenty of protein
Protein  has powerful effects on appetite. It can increase feelings of fullness, reduce hunger, and help you eat fewer calories ( 6 ).
This may be because protein affects several hormones that play a role in hunger and fullness, including  ghrelin  and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) ( 6 ).
According to one study in 105 people, those with greater adherence to a  high protein diet  lost significantly more weight than those who adhered to a standard protein diet ( 7 ).
If you currently eat a grain-based breakfast, you may want to consider increasing the protein content of your meals.
In one study, people who ate a high protein breakfast with eggs and toast experienced less hunger and ate fewer calories later in the day compared to those who ate a lower protein breakfast with cereal ( 8 ).
Some examples of  protein-rich foods  include chicken breasts, fish, Greek yogurt, lentils, quinoa, and almonds.
Adding protein to your diet has been linked to weight loss and decreased hunger.

4. Prepare more meals at home
Cooking your own meals at home is a great way to include more nutritious foods in your diet.
It might also help promote weight loss.
In fact, research suggests that people who prepare more meals at home tend to gain less weight than those who regularly dine out or eat prepared foods ( 9 ).
A 2017 study also found that meal planning may be associated with improved diet quality and a reduced risk of obesity ( 10 ).
Try stocking up on nutrient-dense ingredients and experimenting with a few new recipes each week.
Preparing more meals at home may help improve the quality of your diet and support weight loss.

5. Eat fiber-rich foods
Eating  fiber-rich foods  may increase satiety, helping you feel fuller for longer.
Studies also indicate that  one type of fiber , viscous fiber, is particularly helpful for weight loss. It increases fullness and reduces food intake ( 11 ,  12 ).
Viscous fiber forms a gel when it comes in contact with water. This gel increases nutrient absorption time and slows down the emptying of your stomach ( 11 ,  12 ).
Viscous fiber is only found in plant foods. Examples include beans, oat cereals, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, oranges, and flax seeds.
A weight loss supplement called  glucomannan  is also very high in viscous fiber ( 13 ).
Viscous fiber is particularly helpful in reducing appetite and food intake. This fiber forms gel that slows down digestion.

6. Drink water regularly
Drinking  water  can help you eat less and lose weight, especially if you drink it before a meal.
One study found that drinking water before a meal reduced the amount of food consumed, without significantly affecting satiety ( 14 ).
Another study showed that drinking 1 pint (568 milliliters) of water before a meal decreased calorie intake and hunger while also increasing fullness and satisfaction ( 15 ).
If you replace calorie-loaded drinks — such as  soda  or juice — with water, you may experience an even greater effect ( 16 ).
Drinking water before meals may help you eat fewer calories. Replacing a sugary drink with water is particularly beneficial.

7. Eat without electronic distractions
Paying attention  to what you eat may help you consume fewer calories.
People who eat while they’re watching TV or playing computer games may lose track of how much they have eaten. This, in turn, can cause overeating.
One 2013 review of 24 studies found that people who were distracted at a meal ate about 10% more in that sitting ( 17 ).
Additionally, absent-mindedness during a meal has an even greater influence on your intake later in the day. People who were distracted at a meal ate 25% more calories at later meals than those who were present ( 17 ).
If you regularly consume meals while watching TV or using electronic devices, you could be inadvertently eating more. These extra calories add up and have a massive impact on your weight in the long term.
However, more research is needed, as studies have turned up mixed results on how mindful eating may affect food consumption ( 18 ,  19 ,  20 ).
People who eat while distracted are more likely to overeat. Paying attention to your meals may help you eat less and lose weight, but more research is needed.

8. Sleep well and avoid stress
When it comes to health, people often neglect  sleep  and stress. Both, in fact, have powerful effects on your appetite and weight.
A lack of sleep may disrupt the appetite-regulating hormones  leptin  and ghrelin. Another hormone, cortisol, becomes elevated when you’re stressed ( 21 ).
Having these hormones fluctuate can increase your hunger and cravings, leading to higher calorie intake ( 22 ,  23 ).
What’s more, chronic sleep deprivation and stress may increase your risk of several diseases, including type 2 diabetes and obesity ( 24 ,  25 ,  26 ).
Poor sleep and excess stress may imbalance several important appetite-regulating hormones, causing you to eat more.

9. Eliminate sugary drinks
High consumption of  sugar-sweetened beverages , such as soda, has been linked with a higher risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes ( 27 ).
It’s very easy to consume excess calories from sugary drinks because liquid calories don’t affect fullness the way solid food does ( 28 ).
Reducing your intake of sugar-sweetened beverages may be associated with weight loss.
According to one meta-analysis, replacing sugar-sweetened beverages with low calorie or no calorie sweetened beverages could be linked to reductions in body weight, BMI, and percent body fat ( 29 ).
Lower calorie beverage options include water and plain or lightly sweetened  coffee  or  green tea .
Sugary drinks have been linked to an increased risk of weight gain and many health conditions. Your brain doesn’t register liquid calories as it does solid foods, making you eat more.

The bottom line
Many simple lifestyle habits can help you lose weight. Some have nothing to do with conventional diet or exercise plans.
You can use smaller plates, eat more slowly, drink water, and avoid eating in front of the TV or computer. Prioritizing foods rich in protein and  viscous fiber  may also help.
However, it’s probably best not to try all these things at once. Experiment with one technique for a while, and if that works well for you then try another one.
A few  simple changes  can have a massive impact on your weight over the long term.
