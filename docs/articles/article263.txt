Both are processed foods
Many people view the Impossible Burger and Beyond Burger as healthier alternatives to meat-based burgers.
That’s in large part because plant-based diets have been linked to a variety of  health benefits , including a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. However, it’s important to note that not all plant-based foods are equally beneficial ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
For instance, heavily processed, sugar- and salt-laden meat alternatives are not as conducive to optimal health as whole-food-based, minimally processed options.
Despite being made exclusively from plants, both these burgers pack added sugar, salt, and other processed ingredients like protein isolates ( 1 ,  2 ).
