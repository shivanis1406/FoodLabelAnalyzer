Mass gainer protein powders, also called weight gain protein powders, are specifically formulated for athletes and weightlifters looking to pack on pounds—particularly  lean muscle mass .
Unlike standard protein powders, they provide a concentrated source of calories from high quality proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, making it easier to increase daily calorie intake without having to consume large volumes of food. Meanwhile, the balance of carbs and protein helps optimize energy levels, ensuring efficient fuel for both performance and recovery.
Here are the seven best mass gainer protein powders, according to our dietitians.
$  = under $3 per serving

What to look for in a mass gainer protein powder
Is it third-party tested?  To ensure that a product contains the types and amounts of ingredients that it claims to on the label, it’s best to choose a product that has been third-party tested. Some well-known testing organizations are NSF International, Informed Choice, Eurofins Scientific, and Analytical Resource Laboratories. If a product is not third-party tested, look for one made in a reputable facility, such as a  CGMP – or UL-certified facility.
How many extra calories do you need?  Make sure to talk with a registered dietitian or another healthcare professional to determine how many additional calories you need per day to reach your weight goals.
What is the serving size?  While some powders are more concentrated, others require adding up to four scoops per serving. Consider what volume is realistic for you to consume on a regular basis.
How is it sweetened?  If having a natural product is important to you, you may want to opt for one that is sweetened with  stevia  or regular sugar rather than artificial sweeteners such as sucralose and acesulfame potassium.
What is the protein source?  High quality sources of protein include  whey , casein, egg, beef, pea, or brown rice. If you prefer to avoid dairy or animal products, opt for a  vegan protein powder .
What is the nutrient profile?  Mass gainers vary in the amounts of protein, carbs, and fat they contain. Consider your dietary needs and choose a product that best fits those needs.
What other ingredients does it contain?  Some products contain artificial colors, additives, and preservatives, which some people prefer to avoid. Others contain added vitamins and minerals.

How to use protein powder for weight gain
Weight gain protein powders contribute a large number of calories on their own. However, it can be helpful to mix the powder with milk or blend it into a smoothie with ingredients such as fruits, vegetables, or nut butter for extra calories and nutrients.
Consuming more than one serving per day could contribute to  unwanted side effects , such as bloating, and lower the quality of your diet by replacing whole foods, which are rich in important nutrients.
As for timing, the best time to take a mass gainer for weight gain is when it’s most convenient for you. However, if you’re looking to build muscle,  some research  suggests that it’s most beneficial to consume protein shortly after completing a strength training workout.
