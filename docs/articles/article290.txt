Title: 12 Healthy Granola Bars

Finding a healthy granola bar is no easy feat.
Ideally, a granola bar should be packed with fiber, protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals to act as a healthy snack that keeps hunger at bay between meals.
Yet, in reality, many granola bars are loaded with sugar or highly processed ingredients, which means they end up more like a candy bar than a nutritious snack.
Here are 12 healthy granola bars designed to suit a variety of life stages, dietary needs, and health or fitness goals.

Kid-friendly granola bars
The best granola bars for children should be made from whole, minimally processed ingredients and contain as little  added sugar  or salt as possible ( 1 ).
Although very few granola bars fit these criteria — including those marketed specifically for kids — the two options below do.
These bars are made from a handful of mostly whole ingredients, including fruit, nuts,  oats , and seeds, and provide very little added sugar or salt. They’re available in six flavors, ranging from sweet potato and coconut to peanut butter and berries. What’s more, they contain no gluten, soy, eggs, or dairy, which also makes them suitable for kids with allergies to these ingredients. One 1.8-ounce (50-gram) bar contains 190–200 calories, 8–10 grams of fat, 23–24 grams of carbs, and 6 grams of protein. They also pack 3–4 grams of fiber, less than 10 mg of salt, and 7–9 grams of sugar — of which only 4 grams are from added sugars ( 2 ).
Nākd bars are made from fruit, nuts, and spices and harbor no added sugar or syrups and very little added salt. They’re also gluten-free, dairy-free, and vegan, and come in 17 distinct flavors, including salted caramel and carrot cake. One 1.3-ounce (35-gram) bar contains 124–156 calories, 5–11 grams of fat, 13–19 grams of carbs, 2–5 grams of  protein , 2–3 grams of fiber, less than 20 mg of salt, and 12–18 grams of sugar — none of which is added ( 3 ).
Kid-friendly granola bars should be made from minimally processed ingredients and contain very little added sugar or salt. Phyter plant-based bars and nākd bars are two good options.

Low-calorie granola bars
Low-calorie granola bars are a convenient, pre-portioned snack that’s especially handy for people  trying to lose weight  or reduce their overall calorie intake.
For best results, steer clear of highly processed, artificially sweetened granola bars. Instead, opt for ones made from whole ingredients, such as whole grains, fruit, nuts, or seeds, as these are more likely to help you meet your daily nutrient needs.
It’s also worth favoring bars rich in fiber and protein. These two nutrients can help you feel fuller for longer, potentially aiding weight loss by reducing the daily number of calories you eat ( 4 ,  5 ).
Health Warrior chia bars are made from mostly whole, plant-based ingredients — primarily  chia seeds . These bars are also dairy-free, gluten-free, and soy-free and contain a mere 100 calories per 0.9-ounce (25-gram) bar. You can expect around 4.5 grams of fat, 14 grams of carbs, 5 grams of fiber, 3 grams of sugar, and 3 grams of protein per portion ( 6 ).

One portion also contains 2.5–6 grams of fat, 21–26 grams of carbs, 3–4 grams of fiber, and 2–4 grams of protein. Each bar is sweetened with rice syrup and cane sugar, although the total amount of added sugars remains low, at around 6–9 grams per bar ( 7 ).
If you prefer non-sweet granola bars, Sheffa savory bars may be an interesting option for you. Made from whole ingredients, such as whole grains,  chickpeas , seeds, dried vegetables, herbs, and spices, they contain 140–150 calories per two 0.6-ounce (18-gram) bars. Two bars also provide around 5–7 grams of fat, 7–8 grams of fiber, 4 grams of protein, and 23–24 grams of carbs — less than 1 gram of which comes from added sugars ( 8 ).
Low-calorie granola bars are an option for people trying to limit their calories or lose weight. Make sure the one you choose is made from mostly whole ingredients and offers fiber and protein.

Protein-rich granola bars

Homemade granola bars
Homemade granola bars are a great alternative to store-bought ones.
Because they typically use minimally processed ingredients and very little added sugar or salt, they’re often more nutritious than packaged versions.
Plus, they’re very simple to make. To get started, mix the ingredients below in a large bowl:
2 cups (160 grams) of oats
1 cup (130 grams) of chopped  nuts of your choice
1 cup (147 grams) of packed, diced, pitted dates
1/4–1/2 cup (60–120 ml) of your nut butter of choice
1/4 cup (60 ml) of maple syrup or honey (optional)
dried fruit, coconut flakes, or chocolate chips to taste (optional)
Once well mixed, spread the mixture equally over a lined loaf pan or baking dish. Bake for 25–30 minutes at 350℉ (176℃) and let cool before slicing and serving. Alternatively, freeze for 20–25 minutes before serving.
This recipe is very versatile and can be adjusted according to your personal preferences.
For instance, you can substitute the oats with puffed rice, kamut flour, or cooked quinoa or  millet . The dates can be swapped for mashed banana and the nuts replaced with seeds.
You can also adjust the quantities of all ingredients to your liking. Granola bars stored in an airtight container will remain fresh for around 1 week. You can extend their shelf life by storing them in your freezer and defrosting small amounts as needed.
Homemade granola bars only require a few ingredients and are simple to make. They’re also often more nutritious than store-bought versions.

The bottom line
Though  granola bars  are easy and convenient, many of the options lining supermarket shelves are loaded with added sugar, salt, and heavily processed ingredients — making for a less-than-ideal snack.
Still, with some searching, it’s possible to find healthy alternatives. The healthy options above are made from mostly whole, nutrient-rich ingredients with little to no added sugars.
If you can’t find them or are looking for a lower-cost alternative, you can make your own using your choice of simple, nutrient-rich ingredients.
