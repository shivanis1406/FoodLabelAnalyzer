Title: The Wild Diet Review: Does It Work for Weight Loss?


Healthline Diet Score: 3.67 out of 5
The Wild Diet is a low-carb, high-fat diet that may appeal to people who want to stop eating processed food and transition to a more traditional way of eating.
Like the paleo diet, the Wild Diet focuses on whole foods, such as lean protein, healthy fats and vegetables.
This article reviews the Wild Diet, including its health benefits, possible drawbacks and foods to eat and avoid.
Overall score:  3.67
Weight loss:  3.5

Nutrition quality:  5
Evidence based:  3.5
BOTTOM LINE:  The Wild Diet emphasizes whole foods and discourages grains and processed foods. While it can be effective for weight loss, the diet cuts out many healthy foods and might lead to weight cycling.

What is the Wild Diet?
The Wild Diet is a low-carb, high-fat eating plan created by Abel James, an entrepreneur and self-described “health crusader.”
James runs a  website  dedicated to the Wild Diet, low-carb recipes and outdoor workouts.
The Wild Diet is similar to the  paleo diet  in many ways, including in its emphasis on whole, traditional food sources, such as meat, fish and vegetables.
The principles of the diet are relatively straightforward:
Avoid grains, processed foods and sugars:  While following the Wild Diet, restrict your intake of processed foods, grains and added sugars.
Prioritize whole foods:  The diet emphasizes whole, unprocessed foods. Choosing organic produce, pasture-raised meats and wild-caught fish is encouraged.
Maintain a low-to-moderate carb intake:  The Wild Diet is a low-carb diet. Carb sources you can eat include fruits, a few starchy and many non-starchy vegetables.
Eat plenty of protein and healthy fat:  High-quality proteins, such as eggs, meat and fish, as well as healthy fats — such as olive oil, nuts and seeds — should be your main energy sources.
Eat a wide variety of foods:  Consume a wide variety of fresh produce, protein and fat to maximize your nutrient intake and prevent boredom.
Have a weekly cheat meal:  You may indulge in a  cheat meal  once or twice per week. This is meant to satisfy cravings, prevent binges and boost metabolism.
The Wild Diet is meant to boost your body’s ability to efficiently burn fat.
Meals on this diet should focus heavily on vegetables while also pulling from other food groups. Try to adhere to the following guidelines for each food group:
Vegetables:   Green, leafy vegetables  should make up the majority of meals. Dieters should try to choose organic produce whenever possible.
Proteins:  Proteins, such as grass-fed beef, chicken, pork or eggs, should take up around a quarter of your plate — with one portion being about the size of the palm of your hand.
Fats:  Nutrient-dense fats, such as coconut oil, olive oil, avocado oil, fatty meats or unsalted nuts, should be added to every meal.
Fruits:  You’re urged to keep fruit intake under two servings per day to maximize fat loss.
Starches:  Starches, such as sweet potatoes, are recommended only for particularly active individuals or those who are less tolerant of fats and proteins.
According to the Wild Diet website, your food composition should be about 65% plant foods and roughly 35% meats, fats and oils.
Potential dieters are encouraged to purchase the Wild Diet book or the Wild Diet 30-Day Fat Loss Program. You’re asked to stick with the regimen for at least 30 days to see maximum progress.
The Wild Diet does not involve counting calories. It simply encourages you to stay away from certain foods.
Abel James asserts that the Wild Diet is “not a diet, but a lifestyle” and that the program is completely customizable to individual tastes and goals.
The Wild Diet is low in carbs and high in fat and protein. It emphasizes whole, high-quality animal and plant foods.

Can it promote weight loss?
Though studies specifically on The Wild Diet are unavailable, a good amount of evidence supports the use of low-carb, whole-food and high-protein diets to promote weight loss.
Low-carb diets have been proven to be an effective weight loss method.
For example, a study in 148 obese adults linked a low-carb diet — at less than 40 grams of net carbs per day — to more weight loss, fat loss and preservation of muscle mass compared to a low-fat diet ( 1 ).
A review of 53 studies in over 68,000 participants demonstrated that low-carb weight loss strategies led to an average of 2.54 pounds (1.15 kg) more long-term weight loss than low-fat versions ( 2 ).
The Wild Diet is also relatively high in protein, a powerful factor in  weight loss .
Protein is the most satiating of all nutrients, meaning it helps keep you full between meals, which may prevent overeating and boost weight loss ( 3 ).
A review of nine studies in 418 people noted that those who followed higher-protein diets for 4–24 weeks experienced 4.58 pounds (2.08 kg) more weight loss than those on lower-protein diets ( 4 ).
Additionally, the Wild Diet emphasizes fresh produce like vegetables and  fruit . Diets high in these foods are associated with lower body weight and greater weight loss ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
What’s more, cutting out processed foods, such as sugar-laden beverages, candy and baked goods, is an excellent way to improve health and drop excess pounds.
Based on scientific evidence, a low-carb, whole-foods-based eating plan like the Wild Diet will most likely result in weight loss.
Evidence suggests that low-carb, high-protein, whole-foods diets like the Wild Diet are effective for weight loss.

Other benefits
Aside from potentially promoting weight loss, the Wild Diet may also offer additional benefits.
The Wild Diet stresses the importance of consuming  whole, nutritious foods .
Consuming whole foods like vegetables, healthy fats, poultry, eggs, fish and fruit is essential to your health ( 8 ).
These foods contain nutrients your body needs to thrive, including vitamins, minerals and  antioxidants .
No matter your dietary preference, a healthy eating plan should always be based on fresh, whole foods.
Many diets emphasize calorie restriction over high-quality, nutritious foods.
Diets that focus on calorie restriction often lead to weight cycling — repeated periods of weight loss followed by weight gain — because they’re hard to stick to in the long term ( 9 ).
Weight cycling — also known as  yo-yo dieting  — is not only associated with weight regain but also increased inflammation in the body ( 10 ).
Plus, focusing on quality over calories encourages you to form a healthy relationship with all foods, regardless of calorie content.
By restricting high-calorie, processed foods and consuming nutrient-dense, filling foods, followers of the Wild Diet can find success without having to worry about  tracking calories .
Since the Wild Diet eliminates processed foods, such as added sugars and simple carbs, it may be a good choice for those struggling with blood sugar control.
Foods high in added sugars, such as sweetened beverages and candy, spike  blood sugar levels  and can increase insulin resistance, a contributing factor to type 2 diabetes, obesity and other health conditions ( 11 ).
The Wild Diet is high in fiber, protein, antioxidants and healthy fats — all of which are recommended for people with diabetes and prediabetes ( 12 ).
Studies show that the paleo diet — which is similar to the Wild Diet —  improves insulin sensitivity  and reduces blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes ( 13 ).
Diets high in processed foods are associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases, such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers ( 14 ).
On the other hand, diets that focus on whole foods and limit processed foods are linked to a reduced risk of chronic disease.
For example, diets rich in vegetables, nuts, seeds, fruits and seafood provide  protection from heart disease , while consuming sweetened beverages and fast food increases heart disease risk ( 15 ).
Cutting out processed foods may also reduce your risk of certain cancers.
A study in 104,980 people found that a 10% increase in the proportion of ultra-processed foods in the diet was associated with a greater than 10% increased risk of breast cancer and cancer overall ( 16 ).
What’s more, diets high in vegetables like the Wild Diet are associated with a lower risk of  cancer  ( 17 ).
The Wild Diet includes whole, nutrient-dense foods that may help reduce your risk of certain chronic diseases, benefit blood sugar control and lower your chances of yo-yo dieting.

Potential drawbacks
Although the Wild Diet offers many benefits, it has some drawbacks as well.
While the Wild Diet promotes many healthy foods, it excludes certain nutritious items.
For instance,  grains  are off-limits, and beans and lentils are discouraged unless soaked, strained and slow-cooked.
Plus, healthy starches, such as sweet potatoes, are restricted for anyone who isn’t highly active.
However, the same can be said for other low-carb eating plans, such as the paleo diet.
Cutting carbs can indeed spark weight loss and improve health. However, diets containing complex carbs, such as beans and whole grains, have also been shown to benefit health.
For example, the  Mediterranean diet  — which is high in fiber-rich beans and whole grains — has been proven one of the most effective diets for weight loss and overall health ( 18 ,  19 ).
Although the Wild Diet is promoted as a lifestyle, Abel James, its creator, sells 30-day fat loss systems that are meant to induce rapid weight loss.
While overall weight loss is healthy if you have excess body fat, testimonials on the Wild Diet website suggest that followers can lose as much as 50 pounds (22.7 kg) in six weeks ( 20 ).
While some people may find that the Wild Diet results in rapid weight loss, it’s best to aim for a  healthy  weight loss goal of 1–2 pounds (0.5–1 kg) per week.
Slower weight loss may help preserve more muscle mass and is easier to maintain than more rapid weight loss programs ( 21 ).
Even though James states that the Wild Diet can be adapted to fit  vegetarian and vegan lifestyles , it cuts out some foods that plant-based diets rely on.
Because legumes are discouraged unless properly prepared and whole grains are barred, vegans and vegetarians may need to find alternate food sources while on the Wild Diet.
Although it’s possible for the Wild Diet to be adapted to meet vegetarian or vegan needs, careful meal planning would be necessary in order to avoid  nutrient deficiencies .
The Wild Diet restricts certain healthy foods and may be difficult to follow for vegetarians and vegans. Plus, the rapid weight loss advertised on its website may be unrealistic for most people.
