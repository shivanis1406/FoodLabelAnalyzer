Title: 8 Ways to Make Your Coffee Super Healthy



Coffee has several health benefits. But making the most of your coffee means carefully choosing what you put in it.
Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world. Many health professionals believe it’s also one of the healthiest.
For some people, it’s the single largest source of antioxidants in the diet, outranking both fruits and vegetables combined ( 1 ,  2 ).
Here are a few tips to turn your coffee from healthy to super healthy.

1. No Caffeine After 2 P.M.
Coffee is one of the richest natural sources of caffeine in the diet.
Caffeine  is a stimulant, which is one of the main reasons coffee is so popular. It gives you a jolt of energy and helps you stay awake when you feel tired ( 3 ).
But if you drink coffee late in the day, it can interfere with your sleep. Poor sleep is associated with all sorts of health problems ( 4 ,  5 ).
For this reason, it’s important not to drink coffee late in the day. If you must, choose  decaf  or opt for a cup of tea instead, which contains much less caffeine than coffee ( 6 ).
Abstaining from coffee after 2–3 p.m. is a good guideline. That said, not everyone is equally sensitive to caffeine, and some people may sleep just fine even if they had coffee late in the day.
Nevertheless, if you feel like you could improve your sleep, avoiding coffee late in the day could be an effective strategy.
There are many other ways you can improve your sleep quality. Read  this article  for more science-based tips.
Drinking coffee late in the day could be impairing your sleep quality. Avoiding coffee after 2–3 p.m. is probably a good idea.

2. Do Not Load Your Coffee With Sugar
Although coffee is healthy in itself, you can easily turn it into something harmful.
The best way to do that is to put a whole bunch of sugar in it. Added sugar is arguably one of the  worst ingredients  in the modern diet.
Sugar, mainly due to its high amount of fructose, is linked to all sorts of serious diseases like obesity and diabetes ( 7 ).
If you can’t imagine living your life without a sweetener in your coffee, use a  natural sweetener  like stevia.
There are numerous ways you can reduce your intake of added sugar even further. Here are  14 additional  strategies.
Avoid adding sugar to your coffee. If you regularly turn your coffee into a sugary treat, you might be eliminating its overall health benefits.

3. Choose a Quality Brand, Preferably Organic
The quality of coffee can vary greatly depending on the processing method and how the coffee beans were grown.
Coffee beans tend to be sprayed with synthetic pesticides and other chemicals that were never intended for human consumption ( 8 ).
However, the  health effects of pesticides  in food are controversial. There is currently limited evidence that they cause harm when found at low levels in produce.
Nevertheless, if you are worried about the pesticide content of your coffee, consider buying organic coffee beans. They should contain much lower amounts of synthetic pesticides.
If you are worried about pesticide contamination in your coffee, choose a quality, organic brand.

4. Avoid Drinking Too Much
While a moderate intake of coffee is healthy, drinking too much may reduce its overall benefits.
Excessive caffeine intake may have various  adverse side effects , although people’s sensitivity varies ( 5 ).
In general, Health Canada recommends not exceeding 1.1 mg per pound (2.5 mg per kg) of body weight per day ( 9 ).
Given that an average cup of coffee may contain around 95 mg of caffeine, this corresponds to about two cups of coffee per day for someone weighing 176 pounds (80 kg) ( 10 ).
However, much higher amounts of caffeine (400–600 mg) per day (about 4–6 cups) are not associated with any adverse side effects in most people ( 11 ).
Read  this article  for detailed information about the amount of caffeine found in different coffee drinks.
Drinking coffee is all about balancing its risks and benefits. Listen to your body and consume no more than you can comfortably tolerate.
Drinking too much coffee may cause adverse side effects. However, this depends on the amount of caffeine consumed and individual tolerance.

5. Add Some Cinnamon to Your Coffee
Cinnamon is a tasty spice that mixes particularly well with the flavor of coffee.
Studies show that  cinnamon  can lower blood glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides in diabetics ( 12 ).
If you need some flavor, try adding a dash of cinnamon. It’s surprisingly good.
To lower the risk of potential adverse effects, opt for Ceylon cinnamon instead of the more common Cassia cinnamon, if possible.
Spice your coffee with a dash of cinnamon. Not only does it taste good, it might also improve your health.

6. Avoid Low-Fat and Artificial Creamers
Commercial low-fat and artificial  creamers  tend to be highly processed and may contain questionable ingredients.
However, there is not much research on the health effects of non-dairy coffee creamers. Their contents vary by brand, and some may be healthier than others.
Nevertheless, whole, natural foods are generally a better choice.
Instead of a non-dairy creamer, consider adding some full-fat cream to your coffee, preferably from grass-fed cows.
Studies show that milk products contain some important nutrients. For example, dairy is an excellent calcium source and may  reduce the risk  of osteoporosis and bone fractures ( 13 ).
Additionally, grass-fed cow’s milk contains some vitamin K, which is also linked to improved bone health ( 14 ).
Non-dairy creamers are highly processed and may contain questionable ingredients. If you like diluting your coffee with a creamer, consider choosing whole milk or cream.

7. Add Some Cocoa to Your Coffee
Cocoa is loaded with antioxidants and associated with all sorts of health benefits, including a reduced risk of heart disease ( 15 ,  16 ).
Try adding a dash of cocoa powder to your coffee for some added flavor.
Caffè mocha, a chocolate-flavored version of caffè latte, is served in many coffeehouses. However, caffè mocha is usually sugar-sweetened.
You can easily make your own at home and skip the added sugar.
You can combine the benefits of coffee and dark chocolate by adding a dash of cocoa powder to your coffee.

8. Brew Your Coffee Using a Paper Filter
Brewed coffee contains cafestol, a diterpene that can raise cholesterol levels in the blood ( 17 ,  18 ).
However, reducing its levels is simple. Just use a paper filter.
Brewing coffee with a paper filter effectively lowers the amounts of cafestol but lets the caffeine and beneficial antioxidants pass through ( 19 ).
However, cafestol is not all bad. Recent studies in mice suggest it has anti-diabetic effects ( 20 ).
Coffee contains cafestol, a compound that may raise blood cholesterol levels. You can lower the amount of cafestol in your coffee by using a paper filter.

The Bottom Line
Coffee is a popular beverage known for its stimulant effects.
A high intake of coffee is linked to various  health benefits . However, there are several ways you can improve these benefits even further.
Most importantly, avoid loading your coffee with added sugar. Instead, you can flavor your coffee by adding a dash of cinnamon or cocoa.
Also, consider abstaining from coffee in the late afternoon and evening, as it may impair the quality of your sleep.
By following the tips above, you can make your cup of coffee even healthier.
