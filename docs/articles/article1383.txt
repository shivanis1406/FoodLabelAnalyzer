Title: 28 Healthy Snacks Your Kids Will Love

Growing kids often get hungry between meals. Many packaged snacks for kids may be unhealthy – full of added sugars and artificial ingredients. Here are 28 healthy snacks kids love.
Snack time is a great opportunity to sneak some extra nutrients into your child’s diet.
Instead of highly processed snack foods, snack time is a great time to offer your child whole foods that provide energy and nutrition.

28 healthy snack ideas for your kids
Here is a list of kid-friendly snacks that are both healthy and delicious.



1. Yogurt
Yogurt  is an excellent snack for kids because it’s a good source of protein and calcium.
Calcium is especially important for kids’ developing bones.
Some yogurts also contain live bacteria, which  benefit the digestive system .
Most yogurts marketed to kids are high in sugar. Instead, choose plain, full-fat yogurt and sweeten it with fresh fruit or a drizzle of  honey .
Still, make sure not to give honey to infants under 12 months old, as they’re at a  greater risk  of a serious infection called botulism.

2. Popcorn
You may consider  popcorn  a junk food, but it’s really a nutritious whole grain.
As long as you don’t drown it in unhealthy toppings, popcorn can be a healthy snack for kids. Air-pop your own popcorn, drizzle it with a little butter, and sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese on top.
However, use caution when offering popcorn to younger children, as it can be a choking hazard.

3. Celery with peanut butter and raisins
Celery with  peanut butter  and raisins, sometimes called “ants on a log,” is a fun way to get your child to eat a vegetable.
Cut a stalk of celery into three or four pieces, spread peanut butter inside the celery, and arrange a few raisins on top of the peanut butter.
These three foods combined provide a good balance of carbs, protein, and fat. Just be sure to buy peanut butter without added sugar or vegetable oils.

4. Nuts
Nuts  are  high in  healthy fats, along with fiber and antioxidants. Dietary fat is  important for supporting growth  in children.
Doctors once thought withholding nuts from children might reduce the risk of an allergic reaction, but more recently,  doctors recommend  introducing nuts at an early age lowers this risk.
Nevertheless, nuts can be a choking hazard, so make sure your child is able to handle the texture before giving nuts as a snack.

5. Trail mix
As long as your child is not allergic to nuts, trail mix is a healthy snack for kids to eat on the go.
Most commercial trail mixes contain chocolate candies, which are high in  sugar , but you can easily make your own at home.
For a healthier version, mix nuts,  dried fruit , and a whole-grain cereal.

6. Sliced pears with ricotta cheese
Pears  are a sweet treat and easy for a little one to eat when they’re cut into slices. Pears are high in  fiber  and  beneficial plant compounds .
Spread each slice with ricotta cheese to add a yummy source of protein and calcium to your child’s snack.

7. Cottage cheese
Cottage cheese  is a fresh and creamy cheese that’s soft enough for even infants to eat. It’s rich in protein and a good source of selenium, vitamin B12, and calcium. Vitamin B12 is important for proper  growth and brain development  in children.
You can serve cottage cheese by itself, top it with fresh or dried fruit, or use it as a creamy spread on whole-wheat toast.

8. Oatmeal
Oatmeal  is a healthy breakfast for kids but also makes a great snack. Oats are high in soluble fiber, which  increases the number  of beneficial bacteria in the digestive tract, along with other health benefits.
Skip flavored packets, which are high in sugar, and make your oatmeal with whole, rolled oats. Add about 1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon and some diced apples for sweetness.
If you make the oatmeal with milk instead of water, it will add some additional protein and calcium.

9. A piece of cheese
Cheese is mostly made up of protein and fat and is a good source of calcium.
Studies show  that eating cheese and other  dairy products  is linked to better overall diet quality. Full-fat dairy foods significantly contribute to a child’s  nutritional requirements  for calcium, magnesium, and vitamins A and D.
Cheese  provides children with high quality protein, which is needed for proper growth. Protein will also help them feel full between meals.
What’s more, some studies note that children who eat cheese are  less likely  to get cavities.

10. Veggie pita pocket
Some parents think it’s hard to get their kids to eat vegetables. But if you  make it fun for them , they’re more likely to try the veggies.
Spread some hummus in a whole-wheat pita pocket and slice up raw veggies, such as carrots, cucumbers, lettuce, and bell peppers. Let your child pick a few veggies and fill the pita. Veggies are loaded with important vitamins and minerals, and many kids don’t eat enough of them.

11. Fruit smoothie
A fruit smoothie is a good way to pack a lot of nutrients into a small snack. You can also add veggies to a smoothie. With the sweetness of the fruit, your kid may not even realize they’re in there.
Use whole, fresh ingredients and avoid  fruit juice , which is high in sugar. There are countless combinations you can try, but here is one smoothie recipe to get you started:

They also contain lutein and zeaxanthin, two carotenoids that are beneficial for eye health. Furthermore, they’re one of the best food sources of choline, a vitamin that’s necessary for proper brain development.

13. Banana oat cookies
Homemade banana cookies are a healthy snack for kids that tastes like a treat. These cookies get their sweetness from mashed  bananas  rather than refined sugar.
Refined sugars are  associated with health problems  in children, such as an increased risk of heart disease, childhood obesity, and type 2 diabetes.

14. Raisin snack packs
Raisins  are dried grapes. They have nearly all of the nutrients found in fresh grapes — but in a smaller package.
Raisins contain a decent amount of iron, a nutrient that many children don’t get enough of and which is needed to transport oxygen throughout your body.
Raisin snack packs are an easy grab-and-go snack that’s much healthier than most convenience foods.

15. Turkey and avocado roll-up
A turkey and  avocado  roll-up is an easy-to-eat, healthy snack. Turkey is a good source of  protein , which is responsible for building and repairing tissues in your body. It’s also very filling, which can help kids feel satisfied between meals.
Avocados  are full of heart-healthy fats, along with fiber, folate, pantothenic acid, potassium, several antioxidants, and vitamins C and K.
To make a turkey and avocado roll-up, first peel and slice an avocado. Gently toss the slices in lime juice to prevent browning. Wrap one piece of turkey around each avocado slice.

16. Baked sweet potato fries

Pickles that contain vinegar don’t contain probiotics, so look in the refrigerated section of the grocery store for pickles with live cultures. Avoid sweet pickles, which are high in added sugars.

18. Kale chips
Kale  is considered a superfood, as it’s  packed with nutrients  but low in calories. It is a rich source of vitamins A, C, and K.

20. Energy balls

Bell peppers taste delicious dipped in guacamole, a creamy spread made from mashed avocados.

22. Whole-grain crackers and nut butter
You can make your own sandwich crackers by spreading a little nut butter, such as almond butter, on whole-grain crackers. This snack has a good balance of protein, carbs, and fat.
However, choose crackers for your kids carefully. Many crackers are full of refined flour, hydrogenated oils, and even sugar. Instead, choose crackers made with 100%  whole grains  and seeds.

23. A piece of fruit
A piece of  fruit  is a convenient and healthy snack for kids. Most fruits contain fiber and important nutrients like potassium and vitamins A and C.
Bananas, apples, pears, grapes, peaches, and plums are examples of fruits that can be used for grab-and-go snacks.
Cut fruits like pineapple, cantaloupe, and  mango  into bite-size pieces and store them in small containers for convenient snacks.

26. Apples and peanut butter dip
Apple slices and peanut butter are a delicious combination. The skin of an  apple  contains  pectin , a soluble fiber that feeds friendly gut bacteria and improves digestive health.
Peanut butter has a thick consistency, which may be difficult for kids to use as a dip.
