Most variations of the plan involve restricting  refined carbs , processed foods, and added sugars while eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats, along with a good source of protein with each meal.

Others recommend intermittent fasting, which involves limiting food intake to a specific window of time each day.
Exercise is another key component of the plan. Activities such as yoga, hiking, boxing, indoor cycling, and Pilates are all highly encouraged.

Exercise is an important aspect of the Victoria’s Secret Model Diet. While there are no specific guidelines for the type and length of workouts you should do, it’s best to stay consistent and find a routine that works for you.

Does it work for weight loss?
Although there’s no research available on the Victoria’s Secret Model Diet specifically, studies have found that certain components of the diet could be beneficial for weight loss.
For starters, the plan encourages eating high quality  protein sources  with each meal, including poultry, seafood, and lean cuts of meat.
Studies show that increasing your protein intake could help enhance feelings of fullness and improve appetite control ( 1 ).
The diet also promotes eating plenty of fiber-rich fruits and vegetables, both of which have been tied to weight loss ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
Several other foods encouraged on the program may also be linked to increased weight loss, including whole grains, nuts, and  legumes  ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
Regular exercise, which is another essential aspect of the plan, can also increase both weight loss and fat loss ( 8 ).
Some versions of the plan also incorporate intermittent fasting, which has been shown to increase weight loss and reduce body fat ( 9 ,  10 ).
Several of the foods encouraged on the Victoria’s Secret Model Diet could help increase weight loss. Regular exercise and intermittent fasting can also support weight loss and fat loss.

Benefits
The Victoria’s Secret Model Diet encourages eating various healthy whole foods that are rich in nutrients.
It also limits processed foods, which have been associated with chronic conditions such as heart disease,  type 2 diabetes , cancer, and depression ( 11 ).
Foods high in  added sugar  are also restricted as part of the diet. Added sugar consumption can contribute to many health issues, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, liver problems, and heart disease ( 12 ).
Furthermore, the plan places a strong emphasis on exercise. Besides increasing weight loss, regular physical activity may help extend your life and protect against disease ( 13 ).
Because the diet provides a general set of guidelines rather than strict rules or regulations, it may also be appealing to those who prefer a diet that offers more flexibility.
The Victoria’s Secret Model Diet offers more flexibility than many other diet plans. It also encourages exercise, limits processed foods, and restricts added sugar, all of which can benefit health.

Potential downsides
One of the biggest drawbacks of the Victoria’s Secret Model Diet is that there’s no single set of rules or recommendations to follow.
In fact, a variety of websites offer conflicting guidelines on which foods are permitted and what your exercise routine should look like.
For this reason, the diet may be especially challenging to follow for those who prefer a more structured program.
It’s also important to keep in mind that individuals’  nutritional needs  can vary quite a bit depending on factors like age, sex, height, weight, and activity level.
Some versions of the diet also restrict calorie intake to as few as 1,300 calories per day, which is insufficient for most people. This could cause a range of  side effects , including hunger, fatigue, nausea, and constipation ( 14 ).
Furthermore, the diet seems to prioritize weight loss rather than supporting overall health.
It encourages dieters to try to look like Victoria’s Secret models, which is not a realistic, attainable, or healthy goal for most people.
Focusing on improving your health by making changes to your diet and lifestyle instead could foster a positive relationship with food and with your body.
The Victoria’s Secret Model Diet doesn’t have a specific set of guidelines or rules to follow. It focuses on weight loss rather than overall health and does not account for individual differences in nutritional needs.

The bottom line
The Victoria’s Secret Model Diet is a program designed to mimic the eating patterns and exercise routines of many Victoria’s Secret models.
The plan encourages eating healthy,  nutrient-dense foods  and promotes regular physical activity, which could be beneficial for weight loss.
However, the plan focuses solely on weight loss, sets unrealistic and unattainable goals, and doesn’t consider individual differences in nutritional needs.
Additionally, there are many different sets of guidelines available online, which could make it challenging to follow for those who prefer a more structured diet plan.
