Title: 8 Impressive Benefits of Carrot Juice

Carrot juice is extracted from whole carrots and is extremely nutritious.
It not only provides  potassium  and vitamin C but also is very rich in  provitamin A . Drinking carrot juice is thought to boost immunity and improve eye and skin health, among other benefits ( 1 ).
Here are eight impressive benefits of carrot juice.

1. Highly nutritious
Carrot juice is low in calories and carbs while packing numerous nutrients. One cup (236 grams) contains ( 1 ):
Calories:  94
Protein:  2 grams
Fat:  less than 1 gram
Carbs:  22 grams
Sugars:  9 grams
Fiber:  2 grams
Vitamin A (as provitamin A):  251% of the Daily Value (DV)
Vitamin C:  22% of the DV
Vitamin K:  31% of the DV
Potassium:  15% of the DV
Carrot juice also provides the carotenoid pigments  lutein and zeaxanthin , which act as antioxidants in your body. Antioxidants fight unstable molecules called free radicals ( 1 ,  2 ).
The main carotenoid in carrot juice is  beta carotene , which is responsible for carrots’ orange color. Your body converts it into the antioxidant vitamin A.
Carrot juice is loaded with vitamin A and is high in vitamins C and K. It also contains plant compounds called carotenoids, which act as antioxidants.

2. May improve eye health
Carrot juice contains high amounts of nutrients that  benefit your eyes .
Specifically, 1 cup (236 grams) of carrot juice packs over 250% of the DV for vitamin A, mostly in the form of provitamin A carotenoids like beta carotene ( 1 ).
Vitamin A  is vital for eye health. Several studies associate the intake of fruits and vegetables that contain provitamin A with a decreased risk of blindness and age-related eye diseases ( 3 ,  4 ).
What’s more, carrot juice is an excellent source of lutein and zeaxanthin, two other carotenoids that accumulate in your eyes and shield them from damaging light ( 1 ,  2 ).
A high dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin may lower your risk of eye issues, such as age-related  macular degeneration (AMD) . One older analysis of six studies linked a high dietary intake of these compounds to a 26% lower risk of late AMD compared with a low intake ( 5 ,  6 ).
Carrot juice is a great source of carotenoids, including beta carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin, which are vital for eye health and may protect against AMD.

3. May boost immunity
Carrot juice may  give your immune system a boost .
Both vitamins A and C found in carrot juice act as antioxidants and protect immune cells from free radical damage ( 7 ,  8 ).
Additionally, this juice is a rich source of  vitamin B6 , providing 30% of the DV in 1 cup (236 grams). Not only is vitamin B6 necessary for optimal immune response, but a deficiency in it is also linked to weakened immunity ( 1 ,  9 ).
In one study, vitamin B6 depletion in older adults reduced the production of a signaling molecule known as interleukin 2, which regulates the activity of immune cells ( 9 ).
And one rodent study found that inadequate dietary intake of vitamin B6 prohibited the growth of immune cells called  lymphocytes  ( 9 ).
As a rich source of vitamins A, B6, and C, carrot juice may help strengthen your immune system.

4. May provide anticancer effects
Test-tube studies suggest that certain compounds in carrot juice may  protect against cancer .
Specifically, polyacetylenes, beta carotene, and lutein from carrot juice extract may be effective against human cancer cells ( 10 ,  11 ,  12 ).
One test-tube study found that treating  leukemia  and  colon cancer  cells with beta carotene led to cancer cell death and stopped the cell growth cycle ( 11 ).
In another animal study, polyacetylenes from carrots reduced the number and growth rate of  colorectal tumors  in rats. Importantly, the amount of polyacetylenes given to the rats is similar to the amount you may consume with a typical daily intake of carrots ( 10 ).
While these results appear promising, few human studies are available. More extensive research is needed.
Carrot juice should not be considered a cancer treatment.
Compounds in carrot juice have been shown to trigger cancer cell death in test-tube and animal studies. However, more human research is needed.

5. May improve blood sugar management
Drinking small amounts of carrot juice may help lower  blood sugar levels .
In particular, studies in rats with  type 2 diabetes  show that fermented carrot juice decreases blood sugar and improves other related markers. That’s because the fermented juice contains  probiotics , which are beneficial bacteria that affect gut bacteria associated with diabetes ( 13 ,  14 ).
Another older rodent study found that  purple carrot  juice boosts blood sugar management due to the anti-inflammatory effect of its  anthocyanin  pigments ( 15 ).
Yet, these are very specific types of carrot juice. It isn’t known whether regular carrot juice has similar effects.
Even so, carrot juice has a low  glycemic index (GI)  — a measure of how much a certain food increases blood sugar levels. Consuming  low glycemic foods  and beverages may help improve blood sugar management in people with diabetes ( 16 ,  17 ).
Thus, carrot juice may be a good replacement for high GI fruit juices. However, it’s important to keep portion sizes in check, as too much can  spike blood sugar levels . Generally, 4 ounces is a safe portion size.
Limited animal studies suggest that fermented and purple carrot juice improves blood sugar management. While regular carrot juice also has a low GI, you should limit your intake to moderate amounts.

6. May improve skin health
The nutrients in carrot juice may be particularly beneficial for skin health.
One cup (236 grams) of carrot juice provides over 20% of the DV for  vitamin C , a water-soluble nutrient necessary for  collagen  production. This compound is the most abundant fibrous protein in your body, providing elasticity and strength to your skin ( 1 ,  18 ).
Additionally, vitamin C acts as an antioxidant to protect your skin from free radical damage ( 18 ).
The beta carotene in carrot juice may likewise  aid your skin . One review of studies found that a carotenoid-rich diet may protect your skin from ultraviolet (UV) damage and improve skin appearance ( 19 ).
Carrot juice provides vitamin C and beta carotene, two antioxidants that may protect your skin from damage. Vitamin C is also necessary for the production of collagen, which strengthens skin.

7. May boost heart health
Carrot juice may help reduce risk factors for heart disease.
First, carrot juice is a  good source of potassium , a mineral that plays an important role in proper blood pressure regulation. A high potassium diet has been shown to protect against high blood pressure and stroke ( 1 ,  20 ,  21 ,  22 ).
Antioxidant compounds in carrot juice may also  benefit your heart .
An older 3-month study in 17 adults with high cholesterol and triglyceride levels found that drinking 2 cups (480 mL) of carrot juice per day significantly increased blood antioxidants and decreased the oxidation of blood lipids that may lead to heart disease ( 23 ).
Still, more human research is needed.
The potassium and antioxidants in carrot juice may help lower blood pressure and decrease risk factors for heart disease.

8. May protect your liver
The carotenoids in carrot juice are thought to  promote liver health .
Several studies indicate that the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of carotenoids protect against  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease  (NAFLD) ( 24 ,  25 ).
NAFLD occurs when fat accumulates on your  liver , typically as a result of unhealthful nutrition, excess weight, or  obesity . It may eventually progress to  liver scarring  and lasting damage.
An 8-week study in rats found that carrot juice reduced some markers of NAFLD. Another rodent study produced similar results, revealing that carrot juice didn’t reduce fat on the liver, but it decreased inflammatory blood markers ( 26 ,  27 ).
Nonetheless, human studies are needed.
Due to its high amount of anti-inflammatory carotenoids, carrot juice may protect your liver against conditions like NAFLD. Yet, more research is necessary.

Carrot juice precautions
While carrot juice is perfectly safe for most people, there are a few precautions to keep in mind.
Some carrot juices, especially freshly prepared varieties, may not have been  pasteurized  to kill harmful bacteria.  Pregnant people , older adults, young children, and those with  compromised immune systems  should avoid unpasteurized carrot juice.
Additionally, drinking very large amounts of carrot juice may lead to carotenemia, a condition that  turns your skin yellow-orange  as a result of high blood levels of beta carotene ( 28 ).
While it’s not harmful, it can be alarming. Temporarily removing sources of beta carotene from your diet typically resolves the issue.
Finally, carrot juice has less fiber than whole carrots and contains natural sugars. The lower fiber content means its sugars are absorbed more quickly, so drinking too much carrot juice may spike your blood sugar levels.
While carrot juice’s low GI means that it doesn’t increase your blood sugar as much as  other juices , you should still be careful to moderate your intake if you have diabetes — especially if you drink it on its own ( 16 ).
Some varieties of carrot juice may not be pasteurized and should be avoided by certain populations, including pregnant people. Drinking too much may also temporarily change your skin color.

The bottom line
Carrot juice is incredibly nutritious, providing potassium, several  carotenoids , and vitamins A, C, and K.
Drinking this  veggie juice  may help improve eye health, boost your immune system, and strengthen your skin. However, more extensive human research is needed.
Since it contains natural sugars, you may want to drink carrot juice in moderation.
