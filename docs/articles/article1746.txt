Stock is typically made by simmering the  bones  and meat of animals for an extended period of time, producing a rich and flavorful liquid.
Because stock is usually thicker and has a more intense flavor, it works especially well in recipes like soup or dumplings.
On the other hand, broth is made from meat or cooked vegetables. It’s much lighter than stock and can be made using chicken, beef, or fish.
It’s thinner and less concentrated than stock, so it may be a better option for dishes that feature other strong flavors, including cream-based sauces, gravies, and casseroles.

Some people report sensitivities to the effects of MSG and may experience symptoms like weakness, dizziness, headaches, flushing, and difficulty breathing after consuming MSG in very large amounts ( 6 ).
However, according to the FDA, the agency hasn’t been able to confirm that normal amounts of MSG in food can cause such symptoms ( 5 ).
