Title: Is Sprite Caffeine-Free?

Many people enjoy the refreshing, citrusy taste of Sprite, a lemon-lime soda created by Coca-Cola.
Still, certain sodas are high in caffeine, and you may wonder whether Sprite is one of them, especially if you’re trying to limit your caffeine intake.
This article reviews whether Sprite contains caffeine and who should avoid it or other sodas.

Caffeine and nutritional content
Sprite — like most other non-cola sodas — is caffeine-free.
The main ingredients in Sprite are water,  high-fructose corn syrup , and natural lemon and lime flavors. It also contains citric acid, sodium citrate, and sodium benzoate, which act as preservatives ( 1 ).
Even though Sprite does not contain caffeine, it’s loaded with sugar and, therefore, may increase your energy levels in a way similar to that of caffeine.
A 12-ounce (375-ml) can of Sprite packs 140 calories and 38 grams of carbs, all of which come from added sugar ( 1 ).
Upon drinking it, most people experience a sudden increase in blood sugar. As a result, they may feel a jolt of energy and subsequent crash, which can include jitters and/or anxiety ( 2 ).
Feeling anxious, nervous, or jittery can also occur after  consuming too much caffeine  ( 3 ).
As such, while Sprite doesn’t contain caffeine, it may provide a boost of energy and exert effects similar to those of caffeine when drunk in excess.
Sprite is a clear, lemon-lime soda that doesn’t contain caffeine but is high in added sugar. Thus, similarly to caffeine, it may provide a jolt of energy.

Most people should limit Sprite and other sodas
Excessive  added sugar intake  has been linked to an increased risk of weight gain, diabetes, and heart disease, as well as other health conditions ( 4 ).
Current recommendations from the American Heart Association suggest a daily upper limit of 36 grams (9 teaspoons) of added sugar for adult men and 25 grams (6 teaspoons) of added sugar for adult women ( 5 ).
Just 12 ounces (375 ml) of Sprite, which pack 38 grams of added sugar, would exceed these recommendations ( 1 ).
Therefore, drinking Sprite and other  sugar-sweetened beverages  should be limited in a healthy diet.
What’s more, people with diabetes or other issues with blood sugar regulation should be particularly careful about drinking Sprite, especially if they regularly eat other foods that are high in added sugars.
Drinking just one 12-ounce (375-ml) can of Sprite provides you with more added sugar than is recommended per day. Therefore, you should limit your intake of Sprite and other sugary sodas.

What about Sprite Zero Sugar?
Sprite Zero Sugar is also caffeine-free but contains the  artificial sweetener   aspartame  instead of sugar ( 6 ).
Since it’s free of added sugar, those who want to limit their sugar intake may believe that it’s a healthier choice.
Still, research on the long-term safety of artificial sweeteners is lacking. Studies on the effects of these sweeteners on appetite,  weight gain , and cancer and diabetes risk have yielded mostly inconclusive results ( 7 ).
Therefore, more extensive research is needed before recommending Sprite Zero Sugar as a healthier alternative to regular Sprite.
Sprite Zero Sugar contains the artificial sweetener aspartame instead of added sugar. While it’s often thought of as a healthier choice than regular Sprite, studies on the effects of artificial sweeteners in humans have been inconclusive.

Healthier substitutions for Sprite
If you enjoy Sprite but would like to reduce your intake, there are several healthier substitutes to consider.
To make your own lemon-lime drink without sugar, combine club soda with fresh  lemon and lime  juice.
You may also like naturally flavored carbonated drinks, such as La Croix, that don’t contain added sugars.
If you’re not avoiding caffeine and drinking Sprite for its energy boost from sugar, give tea or  coffee  a try instead. These beverages contain caffeine and are naturally free of sugar.
If you like to drink Sprite but want to reduce your sugar intake, try a naturally flavored sparkling water. If you aren’t avoiding caffeine and drink Sprite for an energy boost, opt for tea or coffee instead.

The bottom line
Sprite is a caffeine-free lemon-lime soda.
Yet, its high added sugar content can provide a quick boost of energy. That said, Sprite and other sugary sodas should be limited in a healthy diet.
Though Sprite Zero Sugar is sugar-free, the health effects of the artificial sweetener it contains have not been fully studied, and healthier substitutes exist.
For example, lemon-lime sparkling water is a healthier choice that’s also caffeine-free. Or, if you’re looking for an option that has caffeine but no added sugars, try unsweetened coffee or  tea .
