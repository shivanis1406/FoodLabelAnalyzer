Title: Foods That Help Ease Anxiety

Certain foods like almonds, and herbs, such as chamomile, can benefit brain function and potentially relieve anxiety symptoms.
Anxiety  is one of the most prevalent mental health conditions, affecting approximately 7.3% of the global population ( 1 ).
It’s an umbrella term used to describe various disorders — such as generalized anxiety disorder,  social anxiety , and phobias — and is generally characterized by constant feelings of tension, worry, and nervousness that can interfere with daily life ( 1 ).
In many cases, medication is often required as a main course of treatment. However, there are  several strategies  you can also use to help reduce anxiety symptoms, from exercising to breathing techniques.
Additionally, there are many foods you can eat that may help support brain function and lower the severity of your symptoms, mostly due to their brain-boosting properties.
Here are 9 science-backed foods and beverages that may help ease anxiety.

1. Salmon
Salmon may be beneficial for reducing anxiety.
It contains nutrients that promote brain health, including vitamin D and the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and  docosahexaenoic acid  (DHA) ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
These nutrients may help regulate the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, which can have calming and relaxing properties ( 6 ,  7 ).
In particular, a diet rich in EPA and DHA is associated with lower rates of anxiety. It’s believed these fatty acids may reduce  inflammation  and prevent brain cell dysfunction which is common in people with anxiety ( 8 ,  9 ,  10 ).
This may also support your brain’s ability to adapt to changes, allowing you to better handle stressors that trigger anxiety symptoms ( 8 ,  9 ,  10 ).
Vitamin D  has also been studied for the positive effects in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. One 2020 meta-analysis showed that vitamin D supplementation was associated with lower rates of negative mood disorders ( 11 ).
In another study, males who ate Atlantic salmon 3 times per week for 5 months reported less anxiety than those who ate chicken, pork, or beef. Moreover, they had improved anxiety-related symptoms, such as heart rate and heart rate variability ( 12 ).
For the most benefit, try adding  salmon  to your diet 2–3 times per week.

2. Chamomile
Chamomile  is an herb that may help reduce anxiety.
It contains both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which may help lower inflammation associated with anxiety ( 13 ,  14 ,  15 ).
Though the mechanisms aren’t clear, chamomile is believed to help regulate neurotransmitters related to mood such as  serotonin , dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ( 16 ,  17 ).
It may also help regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, a central part of the body’s stress response ( 16 ,  18 ).
Some studies have examined the association between chamomile extract and anxiety relief.
One 38-week randomized study in 179 people with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) experienced a significantly greater reduction in symptoms after consuming 1,500 milligrams of chamomile extract per day compared to those who did not ( 15 ).
Another older 2012 study found similar results, noting that those who consumed chamomile extract for 8 weeks experienced reduced symptoms of  depression and anxiety . Though, the study’s low sample size could not provide enough statistical power to demonstrate cause-and-effect ( 16 ).
While these results are promising, most studies have been conducted on chamomile extract. More recent research is necessary to evaluate the anti-anxiety effects of chamomile tea, which is most commonly consumed.

3. Turmeric
Turmeric is a spice that contains  curcumin  — a compound studied for its role in promoting brain health and preventing anxiety disorders ( 19 ,  20 ).
Known for its high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, curcumin may help to prevent damage to brain cells related to chronic inflammation and oxidative stress ( 20 ).
Moreover, animal studies suggest curcumin may increase the conversion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) — an  omega-3  found in plants — to DHA more effectively and increase DHA levels in the brain ( 21 ).
One double-blind, randomized study in 80 people with diabetes found daily supplementation of nano-curcumin — a smaller, more bioavailable form of curcumin — for 8 weeks resulted in significantly lower anxiety scores compared to a placebo ( 22 ).
In another small, randomized crossover study, consuming 1 gram of curcumin per day for 30 days was shown to significantly lower anxiety scores, compared to a placebo ( 23 ).
Though promising, most studies observed the effects of curcumin supplementation rather than obtaining curcumin from  turmeric . Therefore, more research in this area is needed.
That said, incorporating turmeric into your diet is certainly worth a try. To increase curcumin absorption, try pairing it with  black pepper  ( 24 ).

4. Dark chocolate
Incorporating some dark chocolate into your diet may also help ease anxiety.
Dark chocolate  contains flavonols, such as epicatechin and catechin, which are plant compounds that act as antioxidants.
Some research suggests that the flavonols found in dark chocolate may benefit brain function and have neuroprotective effects. In particular, flavonols may increase blood flow to the brain and enhance cell-signaling pathways ( 25 ).
These effects may allow you to adjust better to stressful situations that can lead to anxiety and other mood disorders.
Some researchers also suggest that dark chocolate’s role in brain health may simply be due to its taste, which can be comforting for those with mood disorders ( 26 ).
One cross-sectional study of 13,626 participants found those who consumed dark chocolate had significantly lower symptoms of depression compared to those who seldom ate dark chocolate ( 27 ).
Furthermore, one review of nine studies concluded that consuming cocoa-rich products could improve short-term mood and affect ( 28 ).
While this is promising, more research investigating dark chocolate’s long-term effects on anxiety and mood is needed. Further,  dark chocolate  is best consumed in moderation, as it’s high in calories and easy to overeat. For best results, enjoy a 1- to 1.5-ounce serving at a time.

5. Yogurt
The probiotics, or healthy bacteria, found in some types of yogurt may improve several aspects of your well-being, including  mental health  ( 29 ,  30 ,  31 ).
Though still an emerging field of research, probiotics may support the gut-brain axis — an intricate system between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. In particular, research suggests healthy gut bacteria may be linked with better mental health ( 32 ,  33 ,  34 ).
Further,  probiotic foods  like yogurt may promote mental health and brain function by reducing inflammation and increasing the production of mood-boosting neurotransmitters, such as serotonin ( 35 ,  36 ,  37 ).
According to one study, consuming probiotic yogurt daily for 6 weeks was associated with improved anxiety, stress, and quality of life in postmenopausal females ( 38 ).
Though a promising field of research, more human trials are needed to explore the direct relationship between yogurt consumption and anxiety.
It’s also important to note that not all  yogurt  contains probiotics. For the benefits of probiotics, choose a yogurt with live active cultures listed as an ingredient.

6. Green tea
Green tea contains  L-theanine , an amino acid that’s been studied for the positive effects it may have on brain health and anxiety ( 39 ,  40 ,  41 ).
In one double-blind, randomized study, participants who consumed a beverage containing L-theanine reported significantly lower subjective stress and  decreased cortisol levels , a stress hormone linked with anxiety ( 42 ).
These effects may be due to L-theanine’s potential to prevent nerves from becoming overexcited. Additionally, L-theanine may increase GABA, dopamine, and serotonin, neurotransmitters that have been shown to have anti-anxiety effects ( 43 ).
Moreover,  green tea  contains epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), an antioxidant suggested to promote brain health. It may play a role in reducing certain symptoms by also increasing GABA in the brain ( 44 ).
Interestingly, the combination of L-theanine, EGCG, and other compounds found within green tea appears to play a synergistic role in promoting calmness and alleviating anxiety and may be more effective together than as separate ingredients ( 45 ).
That said, more research is needed.

7. Almonds
Almonds  are a great source of several nutrients thought to promote brain function, including vitamin E and healthy fats ( 46 ,  47 ).
In fact, some animal studies have found that almonds could reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, which could be involved in the development of anxiety ( 48 ,  49 ,  50 ).
Almonds may also offer other mood-boosting properties.
For instance, one study found that increased consumption of  nuts , including almonds, was associated with decreased symptoms of depression ( 51 ).
Another study in 3,172 adults showed that males who consumed the highest amount of nuts were 66% less likely to experience anxiety than those who consumed the lowest amount. However, this association was not observed for females ( 52 ).
Therefore, more high quality studies are needed to understand how almonds may impact mood and anxiety.

8. Blueberries
Blueberries are high in vitamin C and other antioxidants, such as flavonoids, that have been studied for their ability to improve  brain health  and relieve anxiety ( 46 ,  53 ,  54 ,  55 ).
One 4-week study found that daily supplementation with wild  blueberries  was linked to fewer self-reported symptoms of depression in 64 adolescents ( 56 ).
Some animal studies also suggest that certain compounds found in blueberries may reduce oxidative stress and ease symptoms of depression and anxiety ( 57 ,  58 ).
Plus, some studies have even found that increased intake of  fruits , such as blueberries, may be tied to a lower risk of anxiety ( 59 ,  60 ).
Still, additional studies are needed to evaluate the effects of blueberries on anxiety.

9. Eggs
Eggs are an excellent source of tryptophan, a neurotransmitter that may be beneficial for anxiety symptoms ( 61 ).
According to one study, inadequate protein intake and  tryptophan  — both of which are plentiful in eggs — could be associated with higher anxiety levels ( 61 ).
Eggs  also contain vitamin D, with around 6% of the recommended Daily Value (DV) in one large egg ( 62 ).
Some research has found that low vitamin D levels may be associated with increased symptoms of depression and anxiety ( 63 ).
However, while several of the nutrients in eggs may be beneficial, further research is necessary to understand the effects of eggs on anxiety specifically.

Other foods that may help with anxiety
While some of the foods listed below have not been studied specifically for their anti-anxiety effects, they’re rich in nutrients thought to improve related symptoms.
Turkey, bananas, and oats:  These are good sources of the amino acid tryptophan, which is converted to serotonin in the body and may promote relaxation and anxiety relief ( 64 ,  65 ).
Meat and dairy products:  These provide high quality protein including essential amino acids that produce the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, potentially improving mental health ( 46 ,  66 ).
Chia seeds:  Chia seeds are another good source of brain-boosting omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to help with anxiety ( 46 ,  67 ).
Citrus fruits and bell peppers:  These fruits are rich in  vitamin C , which has antioxidant properties that may help reduce inflammation and prevent damage to cells that may promote anxiety ( 46 ,  68 ).
Though these foods may support your mental well-being, they should not replace any medications or other therapies prescribed by a healthcare professional.

The bottom line
Anxiety is a complicated mental health disorder that requires a multitude of approaches to manage it effectively.
Along with medication and therapy, the foods you eat may help support your mental health, reduce anxiety symptoms, and promote better brain health. In particular, whole, minimally-processed foods high in antioxidants appear beneficial.
However, there’s not enough research to support using food as a first-line treatment for anxiety and therefore should not replace any medications or therapies recommended by a healthcare professional.
Nonetheless, adding these foods to your diet is a great way to support brain health and overall well-being.
