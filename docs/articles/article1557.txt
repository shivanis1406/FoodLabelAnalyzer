Title: 12 Science-Based Ways to Reduce Hunger and Appetite

You may be able to reduce hunger by eating foods that keep you fuller for a longer time, such as those high in protein and fiber. Some practices, like mindful eating, may also help.
Hunger and appetite are innate experiences we deal with throughout the day, often without realizing it. They occur when our body needs energy or craves certain foods.
However, constantly feeling hungry can be frustrating, especially after just eating a meal. This may be a sign of not eating enough or not having a balanced diet.
To decrease hunger and appetite, there are  various scientific methods to help,  which we have compiled into a list of 12 ways.

1. Eat enough protein
Adding  more protein  to your diet can  increase feelings of fullness  and potentially help with weight management.  Research  suggests that both animal and vegetable sources of protein can have appetite-suppressing effects.
Getting at least 20–30% of your total calorie intake from protein, or 0.45-0.55 grams per pound (g/lb) or 1.0–1.2 g per kilogram (g/kg) of body weight, is sufficient to provide health benefits. Yet, some studies suggest up to  0.55–0.73 g/lb (1.2–1.6 g/kg) of body weight .
Still,  other studies  have found conflicting results when it comes to high protein diets. Thus, it’s important to remember that there may be other dietary approaches that better suit your habits and personal preferences.

2. Opt for fiber-rich foods
A high  fiber  intake slows digestion and releases fullness hormones. In addition, eating fiber helps produce  short-chain fatty acids  in your gut, which are believed to further  promote feelings of fullness .
Viscous fibers , found in plant foods and supplements, can be especially filling. While the relationship between fiber and appetite is not fully understood,  fiber-rich foods  like vegetables, beans, nuts, and seeds can promote overall health.
Combining protein with fiber may provide added benefits for fullness and appetite. Pairing protein with fiber might provide  double the benefits  for fullness and appetite.
Thay said, the methods of studies examining how  dietary fiber intake influences appetite  have not always been consistent, and some researchers believe it’s too soon to make generalizations about the relationship between fiber and appetite.

3. Drink plenty of water
Animal studies  suggest that thirst may sometimes be mistaken for hunger, affecting food preferences and intake.
Some studies  have also found that thirst status and water intake appear to influence preferences for certain foods more than hunger and how much you eat.
While the neurons that regulate your appetite for both  water  and food are closely related, much remains to be learned about how exactly they interact and why drinking water might also  satisfy your hunger  or appetite for solid foods.
That said, though it’s important to stay hydrated — drinking water shouldn’t replace your meal. In general, keep a glass of water with you and sip it during meals or have a glass before you sit down to eat.

4. Choose solids foods to tame hunger
Calories from solid or liquid foods may  affect your appetite  and your  brain’s reward system  differently.
Two  recent research reviews  found that solid foods and those with a higher viscosity — or thickness —  significantly reduced hunger  compared with thin and liquid foods.
This may be because solid foods require more chewing, which might grant more time for the  fullness signal to reach the brain . On the other hand, softer foods are quick to consume in large bites and may be easier to overeat.
Another theory about why solid food helps reduce hunger is that the extra chewing time allows solids to stay in contact with your taste buds for longer, which can also  promote feelings of fullness .
Aim to include a variety of textures and flavors in your meal to stay satisfied and get a wide variety of nutrients.

5. Eat mindfully
Eating too quickly or while distracted can make it harder for your brain to recognize signals of hunger and fullness.
Mindful eating , which involves focusing on the present moment and internal cues rather than external influences, can help.
As opposed to letting external cues like advertisements or the time of day dictate when you eat,  mindful eating  is a way of tapping into your internal hunger and satiety cues, such as your thoughts and physical feelings.
Research shows  that mindfulness during meals may weaken mood-related cravings and be especially helpful for people susceptible to emotional, impulsive, and reward-driven eating — all of which influence hunger and appetite.
Nevertheless, mindful eating appears to work best for limiting food cravings and increasing awareness of food when it’s paired with a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and other  behavior-focused therapies .

6. Eat slowly
When your appetite or hunger levels are high, it can be especially easy to eat more than you planned. Slowing the pace at which you eat might be one way to curb the tendency to overeat.
For example,  one study  found that people who ate faster took bigger bites and ate more calories overall.
Interestingly, some  newer research  also suggests that your eating rate can affect your endocrine system, including blood levels of hormones that interact with your digestive system and hunger and satiety cues, such as insulin and pancreatic polypeptide.

7. Learn which dinnerware works for you
Reducing the size of your dinnerware might also help you unconsciously reduce your  meal portions  and consume less food without feeling deprived. When you have a larger plate that holds more food, you’re likely to eat more without realizing it.
Though the benefits of  eating on a smaller plate  have been overstated in the past, this doesn’t mean this technique isn’t worth trying.
In addition,  some studies  have also found that eating with a smaller spoon or fork might not affect your appetite directly, but it could help you eat less by slowing your eating rate and causing you to take smaller bites.
It’s worth noting, however, that the size of your dinnerware  may influence  your hunger levels based on a number of personal factors, including your culture, upbringing, and learned behaviors.

8. Exercise regularly
Exercise is  thought to reduce  the activation of brain regions linked to food cravings, which can result in a lower motivation to eat high calorie foods and a higher motivation to eat  low calorie foods .
It also  reduces hunger hormone levels  while increasing feelings of fullness.
Overall, exercise appears to have a relatively positive effect on appetite for most people, but  studies  have noticed a wide variability in the way individuals and their appetite respond to exercise.
In other words, there’s no guarantee the results will be the same for everyone. However, exercise has many benefits, so it’s a great idea to incorporate the movement you enjoy into your day.

9. Get enough sleep
Studies show  that too little sleep can increase subjective feelings of hunger, appetite, and food cravings.
Sleep deprivation  can also elevate ghrelin, a hunger hormone that increases food intake and is a sign that the body is hungry, and the appetite-regulating hormone leptin.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most adults need  7–9 hours of sleep , while  8–12 hours  are recommended for children and teens.

10. Manage your stress level
Excess stress is known to raise levels of the hormone cortisol.
Although its effects can vary from person to person,  high cortisol levels  are generally thought to increase  food cravings  and the drive to eat, and they have even been linked to weight gain.
On the other hand, some people react differently to stress. One study found that acute bouts of stress actually  decreased appetite .
Whether you’ve noticed that you tend to feel hungrier when you’re under stress or often find yourself stress-eating in tense situations, consider some of these techniques to alleviate your stress:
eat a healthy diet rich in  stress-relieving foods
exercise regularly
sip green tea
consider a supplement like  ashwagandha
try yoga or stretching
limit your caffeine intake

11. Eat a bit of ginger
Ginger  has been linked to many  health benefits  due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties from the bioactive compounds it contains.
When it comes to appetite, ginger actually has a reputation for  increasing appetite  in cancer patients by helping to ease the stomach and reduce nausea.
However,  recent research  adds another benefit to the list — it may help reduce hunger.
One  animal study  fed rats an herbal mix that contained ginger along with peppermint,  horse gram , and whey protein. The mixture was found to help regulate appetite and induce satiety, though the results can’t be attributed to the ginger alone.
Still, more studies in humans are needed before strong conclusions about  ginger and hunger  can be reached.

12. Don’t deprive yourself
Researchers are still  working to understand  exactly what happens when you restrict certain foods and whether doing so is an effective approach to lessen cravings for those foods.
Some people tend to  experience cravings  more intensely and are, therefore, more susceptible to them than others.
For most people, it’s not necessary to completely cut your favorite foods out of your diet. You can and should eat your favorite foods, after all.
If you have a craving for a certain specific food, try to enjoy that food in moderation.

Frequently asked questions
