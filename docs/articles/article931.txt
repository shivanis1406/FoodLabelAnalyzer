Title: What Is Raisin Water, and Does It Have Benefits?

Also sometimes referred to as kishmish water, raisin water is a beverage made by soaking raisins overnight, then straining and heating the liquid.
This drink is purported to enhance digestion, flush out toxins, and supply a variety of important nutrients and antioxidants. Plus, it’s said to be delicious, flavorful, and easy to prepare.
Still, you may want to know whether these claims stand up to scrutiny.
This article discusses the potential benefits of raisin water and tells you how to make it at home.

Potential benefits of raisin water
Although no studies have specifically examined raisin water, it may increase your intake of iron and antioxidants. That’s because it’s made from raisins, which are dried grapes.
Keep in mind that research on raisin water itself is still necessary.
Raisins are rich in antioxidants, which are beneficial compounds that protect your cells against harmful compounds known as free radicals.
Raisins are particularly high in ferulic acid, rutin,  quercetin , and trans-caftaric acid ( 1 ).
Antioxidants  play a key role in health and may safeguard against chronic conditions like cancer, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease ( 2 ).
Notably, a study in 15 people showed that antioxidant levels in the blood increased significantly about 1 hour after they ate raisins ( 3 ).
In a study that gave aging rats 0.2 ounces (6 grams) of raisins daily, they experienced increased blood antioxidant levels and improved brain function ( 4 ).
Still, further research is needed.
Raisins contain a  fair amount of iron , with just 1 ounce (28 grams) supplying nearly 3% of the Daily Value (DV) ( 5 ).
This mineral is involved in oxygen transport and red blood cell production. Not getting enough iron in your diet may lead to  iron deficiency anemia , a condition whose symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, pale skin, and weakness ( 6 ,  7 ).
Nonetheless, studies are needed to confirm the exact nutrient profile of raisin water.
Although raisin water has yet to be studied, it may boost your intake of iron and antioxidants.

Considerations
Although raisin water is considered safe for most adults, some people may need to limit their intake.
While rare, raisins may cause an allergic reaction ( 8 ).
Dried fruits  like raisins also typically contain a higher concentration of calories, carbs, and natural sugars than fresh fruit. Eating fresh grapes would be more beneficial for your health.
In rare cases, raisin water may cause an allergic reaction. It may also be relatively high in calories, carbs, and natural sugars. Opting for fresh grapes would be more beneficial for your health.

How to make raisin water
Raisin water is easy to make at home using just two simple ingredients.
To get started, bring 2 cups (475 mL) of water to a boil in a saucepan or pot. Next, remove it from the heat and add 1 cup (145 grams) of  raisins  to the water.
Let the raisins soak overnight, or for at least 8 hours, before straining out the fruit using a colander or sieve.
It’s typically recommended to heat raisin water on the stovetop or in the microwave before drinking it.
Although you can enjoy raisin water at any time of day, proponents suggest drinking it before breakfast to maximize its potential benefits. However, no research indicates that it’s more beneficial in the morning.
You can make raisin water by adding raisins to boiling water, soaking them in it overnight, and straining out the fruit. Although you can drink raisin water at any time of day, advocates recommend enjoying it first thing in the morning.

The bottom line
Raisin water is made by soaking raisins in water overnight, then straining out the  fruit .
Since this drink is made from raisins, it may help increase your intake of important nutrients, including iron and antioxidants.
Still, no evidence supports claims that this beverage aids digestion or flushes toxins out of your body.
Try this today:  While raisin water may offer several health benefits, it’s even healthier to opt for raisins or  fresh grapes  instead. These foods are rich not only in micronutrients but also fiber, which promotes bowel regularity and gut health.
