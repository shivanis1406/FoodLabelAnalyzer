Title: 10 Healthy Ways to Replace Conventional Wheat Bread



For many people, wheat bread is a staple food.

It may also cause a big spike in blood sugar and lead to increased calorie intake ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
Many brands claim to be made from “whole” wheat, but still contain mostly pulverized grains.
There are also many people who are intolerant to gluten, a protein in wheat. This includes people with celiac disease and  gluten sensitivity  ( 4 ,  5 ).
Wheat is also high in short-chain carbs called  FODMAPs , which cause digestive distress in many people.
Although many people can still eat bread without problems, there are others who do best avoiding it.
Fortunately, convenient and healthy alternatives to bread are becoming more readily available.
Here are 10 easy and delicious ways to replace conventional wheat bread:

It is made with several types of sprouted grains and legumes, including wheat, millet, barley, spelt,  soybeans  and lentils.

Some rye breads are made with a mixture of rye and wheat, so they are a little lighter and have a mild, sweet flavor.

This makes sourdough bread more easily digestible and more nutritious than regular bread.
However, it tastes a little more sour than regular bread since it contains lactic acid.
You can make sourdough bread yourself in a few easy steps, but you’ll need to make a starter culture to work with.

Keep in mind that sourdough bread made with gluten-containing grains still contains gluten.
