Title: Everything You Need to Know About Heart Disease

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. It can’t be cured or reversed, but medications, procedures, and lifestyle changes can relieve many symptoms.
According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , 1 in 5 deaths resulted from heart disease in 2021 in the United States. That’s about 695,000 people.

Who gets heart disease?
Heart disease doesn’t discriminate. It’s the leading cause of death for several populations, including white people, Hispanic people, and Black people. Almost half of people in the United States are at risk of heart disease, and the  numbers are rising .
While it can be deadly, it’s also preventable in most people. By adopting certain lifestyle habits early, you can potentially live longer with a healthier heart.

What are the different types of heart disease?
Heart disease encompasses a wide range of cardiovascular problems. Several diseases and conditions fall under the umbrella of heart disease.
Types of heart disease include:
arrhythmia
atherosclerosis
cardiomyopathy
congenital heart defects
coronary artery disease (CAD)
heart infections
The term “cardiovascular disease” may also refer to heart conditions that specifically affect the blood vessels.

What are the symptoms of heart disease?
Different types of heart disease can cause a variety of symptoms.
Arrhythmia is an abnormal heart rhythm. The symptoms you experience may depend on the type of arrhythmia you have, such as a heart rate that’s  too fast  or  too slow .
Learn more about the  symptoms of arrhythmia .
Atherosclerosis reduces blood supply to your extremities. In addition to  chest pain  and  shortness of breath , symptoms of atherosclerosis include fatigue and muscle weakness in the legs from poor circulation.
Learn more about the  symptoms of atherosclerosis .
Congenital heart defects are heart problems that develop when a fetus is growing. Some heart defects are never diagnosed. Others may be detected when they cause symptoms.
Learn more about the  symptoms of congenital heart defects .
CAD is plaque buildup in the arteries that move oxygen-rich blood through the heart and lungs.
Learn more about the  symptoms of CAD .
Cardiomyopathy is a disease that causes the heart muscles to grow larger and turn rigid, thick, or weak.
Learn more about the symptoms of  cardiomyopathy .
Heart infections include the conditions  endocarditis  and  myocarditis .

What are the symptoms of heart disease in women?
Females often experience different signs and symptoms of heart disease than males, specifically CAD and other cardiovascular diseases.
A  2016 study  looked at the symptoms most often seen in women who had experienced a heart attack. The top symptoms didn’t include the “classic” heart attack symptoms, such as chest pain and tingling. Instead, researchers reported that women were more likely to experience  anxiety , indigestion, and fatigue.
Symptoms of heart disease in females can also be confused with other conditions, such as  depression ,  menopause , and anxiety.

What causes heart disease?
Heart disease is a collection of diseases and conditions that cause cardiovascular problems. Each type of heart disease is caused by something entirely unique to that condition.
The  causes of an abnormal heart rhythm  include:
diabetes
CAD
heart defects
high blood pressure  (hypertension)
certain medications
This heart disease occurs while a baby is still developing in the uterus. Some heart defects may be serious and diagnosed and treated early. Some may also go undiagnosed for many years.
Your  heart’s structure  can also change as you age. This can create a heart defect that may lead to complications and problems.
There are several types of cardiomyopathy. Each type is the result of a separate condition:
dilated cardiomyopathy  (the  most common  type)
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
restrictive cardiomyopathy
The causes range from other medical conditions or  comorbidities  or genetics. Not all the causes are fully understood.
Bacteria, parasites, and viruses are the most common causes of heart infections. Uncontrolled infections in the body can also harm the heart if they’re not properly treated.

What are some risk factors for heart disease?
There are many risk factors for heart disease. Some are controllable and others aren’t.
According to the CDC,  around 47%  of people in the United States have at least one risk factor for heart disease. Some of these risk factors include:
high blood pressure
high cholesterol  and low levels of  high-density lipoprotein (HDL) , the “good” cholesterol
smoking
obesity
low physical activity
Smoking, for example, is a controllable risk factor. People who smoke double their chance of developing heart disease, according to the  National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases .
People with diabetes may also have a higher risk of heart disease because high  blood glucose levels  increase the chance of:
angina
heart attack
stroke
CAD
If you have diabetes, managing your glucose can limit your chance of developing heart disease. People with both high blood pressure and diabetes have a  higher risk  of cardiovascular disease.
Other risk factors for heart disease include:
family history
ethnicity
sex
age
Although these risk factors aren’t controllable, you may be able to monitor their effects.
A family history of CAD is especially concerning if  it involves :
a male relative under 55 years old
a female relative under 65 years old
Non-Hispanic Black people, non-Hispanic white people, and people of Asian or Pacific Islander heritage have a higher risk than Native Alaskan or Native American people.
Also, males have a greater risk of heart disease than females. According to the  CDC , the prevalence of heart disease is higher in men than in women.
Learn more about the  risk factors for CAD .

How is heart disease diagnosed?
Your doctor may order several types of tests and evaluations to make a heart disease diagnosis. Some of these tests can be performed before you ever have symptoms of heart disease.
Other tests may be used to look for possible causes of symptoms when they develop.
The first thing your doctor will do is perform a  physical exam . They will take an account of the symptoms you’ve been experiencing.
Then they will want to know your  family  and personal medical history. Genetics can play a role in some heart diseases. If you have a close family member with heart disease, share this information with your doctor.
Blood tests are frequently ordered. This is because they can help your doctor see your  cholesterol levels  and look for signs of inflammation.
A variety of noninvasive tests may be used to diagnose heart disease, such as:
electrocardiogram (EKG)
echocardiogram
stress test
carotid ultrasound
Holter monitor
tilt-table test
CT scan
heart MRI
If a physical exam, blood tests, and noninvasive tests aren’t conclusive, your doctor may want to look inside your body to determine what’s causing your symptoms. Invasive tests may include:
cardiac catheterization
coronary angiography
electrophysiology
Read more about the  tests used to diagnose heart disease .

What treatments are available for heart disease?
Treatment for heart disease largely depends on the type of heart disease you have as well as how far it has advanced. For example, if you have a heart infection, your doctor is likely to prescribe an antibiotic.
If you have plaque buildup, your doctor may take a two-pronged approach: prescribe a medication that can help lower your risk of additional plaque buildup and look to help you adopt certain lifestyle strategies.
Treatment for heart disease falls into three main categories:
Some lifestyle strategies can help protect your heart. These include:
eating a heart-healthy diet, such as the  DASH diet
getting  regular exercise
quitting smoking
limiting  alcohol consumption
A medication may be necessary to treat certain types of heart disease. Your doctor can prescribe a medication that can either cure or manage your heart disease.
Your doctor may also prescribe medications that slow or stop the risk of complications. The exact drug you’re prescribed depends on the type of heart disease you have. Examples include:
beta-blockers
blood thinners
calcium channel blockers
ACE inhibitors
Read more about the  drugs that treat heart disease .
In some cases of heart disease,  surgery  or a medical procedure is necessary to treat the condition and prevent worsening symptoms.
For example, if you have  arteries that are blocked  entirely or almost completely by plaque buildup, your doctor may insert a  stent  in your artery to return regular blood flow.
The procedure your doctor performs depends on the type of heart disease you have and the extent of damage to your heart.

How can I prevent heart disease?
Some risk factors of heart disease can’t be controlled, like your family history. But it’s still important to lower your chance of developing heart disease by decreasing the risk factors you can control.
Having healthy blood pressure and cholesterol ranges are some of the first steps you can take for a healthy heart. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).
A healthy blood pressure is considered  less than 120 systolic and 80 diastolic , which is often expressed as “120 over 80” or “120/80 mm Hg.”
Systolic is the measurement of pressure while the heart is contracting. Diastolic is the measurement when the heart is resting. Higher numbers indicate that the heart is working too hard to pump blood.
Your ideal cholesterol level depends on your risk factors and heart health history. If you have a high risk of heart disease, have  diabetes , or have already had a  heart attack , your target levels will be below those of people with low or average risk.
Practicing the same lifestyle strategies that can help you manage heart disease can also help reduce your chance of developing it.
Doctors recommend  30–60 minutes of exercise  on most days for a total of 2 hours and 30 minutes each week. Check with your doctor to make sure you can safely meet these guidelines, especially if you already have a heart condition.
Quitting smoking can help your heart health because nicotine in cigarettes causes blood vessels to constrict, making it harder for oxygenated blood to circulate. This can lead to atherosclerosis.
In addition,  managing your stress  can help lower your chance for heart disease because  chronic stress  can  contribute  to the development of heart problems.
Making these changes all at once might not be possible, and that’s OK. Talk with your doctor about what will have the biggest impact right now. Even small steps toward these goals help keep you at your healthiest.

Frequently asked questions
High blood pressure (hypertension) makes the heart work harder to circulate blood. This can result in a thickened heart muscle and narrowed arteries.
High blood pressure also makes your heart muscles thicker and less elastic, impairing its ability to pump blood. This reduces the circulation of the oxygen-rich blood your body needs.
Read more about hypertensive heart disease.
It’s not possible to cure or reverse heart disease, so it requires lifetime treatment and monitoring. But medications, procedures, and lifestyle strategies can relieve symptoms.
Coronary intervention or  bypass surgery  might be used if other methods aren’t effective.
Sinus bradycardia  is an abnormally slow heart rate. It’s not necessarily a cause for concern on its own. In fact, it’s often a marker of a healthy heart in athletes or people who are young. But in some cases, it  can cause  serious heart problems.
If you have a leaky heart valve, walking regularly can be good exercise for your heart.
Do your best  to walk at a pace in which you are breathing hard and fast but can still carry on a conversation.
You can also do other aerobic exercises, such as swimming or cycling, following the same principle.
Beta-blockers slow and reduce the strength of your heartbeat. They also decrease your blood pressure. They work by blocking the hormone  adrenaline  (epinephrine) from binding to beta receptors in your body.

Takeaway
Almost half of all people in the United States have an elevated chance of developing heart disease, and the numbers continue to rise.
However, adopting heart-healthy lifestyle strategies can prevent or manage many cases of heart disease.
It’s  not always easy  to make these lifestyle changes in our busy and fast-paced lives, but there are  huge benefits . If you take care of your heart now, it’s more likely to take care of you later in life.
