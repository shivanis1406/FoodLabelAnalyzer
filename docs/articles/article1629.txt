Title: The 19 Best Greek Yogurts

Greek yogurt has taken the dairy aisle by storm.
Like traditional yogurt, Greek yogurt is made from cultured milk. What makes Greek yogurt unique is that after the fermentation process is complete, it’s triple-strained.
As such, there’s much less water in the final product, compared with traditional yogurt. Additionally, this extra step gives Greek yogurt its strong flavor, thick texture, and  protein boost .
If you’re new to the Greek yogurt scene, the sheer number of options may feel overwhelming. But you’ve come to the right place.
The products below were all chosen based on ingredient quality, nutrition content, flavor, and production methods.

Still, a few select brands include  vitamin D  in their Greek yogurts — the best of which are listed here.

Comparison
Here is a closer look at how each of these varieties of Greek yogurt compares.

Greek yogurt benefits
Eating Greek yogurt can fuel your body with a slew of important nutrients, and making a habit of eating this dairy food may help support a wide variety of health goals.
From being a protein source to offering important bone-building  calcium , the beneficial nutrients are plenty.
Some ways that eating Greek yogurt can benefit your health include ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ):
improves bone health
promotes  gut health
supports muscle recovery
enhances weight management

How to choose
When it comes to picking the best Greek yogurt, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. Instead, it’s important to evaluate your personal dietary goals and apply them to your food choices accordingly.
Start by reading the package label to see whether the ingredient quality and nutritional profile of the yogurt aligns with your priorities.
For instance, if you’re aiming to  manage your blood sugar  or reduce your intake of added sugar, you probably want to choose a plain or low sugar flavored yogurt.
If your primary goal is to support digestive health, you may want to go for a brand that guarantees a rich supply of live probiotics.
If you want to increase your calorie or fat intake, opt for Greek yogurts made from whole milk. Conversely, if you’re trying to reduce calories or reduce your intake of fat, low fat or fat-free options may be more suitable.

Frequently asked questions
Green yogurt can be a healthy addition to a person’s diet. Greek yogurt fuels the body with high quality protein, calcium, and live cultures — all factors that are important parts of a balanced and healthy diet.
For those who are focused on managing their blood sugars, choosing Greek yogurt that doesn’t contain large amounts of added sugars is a wise choice. And for those who are focused on weight management, a lower calorie version of Greek yogurt may be the best choice for them.
Regular and Greek yogurt are similar in the sense that they are both made from the same main ingredients — milk and live cultures. To make Greek yogurt, regular yogurt is strained and the  whey protein  and other liquids are removed, resulting in a thicker consistency.
It is absolutely OK to eat yogurt every day for most people. Since the Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggest that most Americans eat three servings of dairy every day, including one yogurt a day can help people meet their daily requirements of this food group ( 6 ).

The bottom line
There are a variety of  Greek yogurt  options to suit almost every taste and dietary preference.
To ensure you choose the one that’s best for you, consider your dietary goals and check the packaging labels closely for features like fat content, sugar content, ingredient quality, and flavor.
