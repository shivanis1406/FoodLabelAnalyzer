How to choose the best treadmill
To help narrow down your search, it’s important to consider how you plan on using your treadmill.
Do you need high speeds for  interval training ? Or is an under-desk treadmill for walking a better fit? Do you want to stream classes using a touch screen or your own device? Here are some factors to consider when you’re shopping:
Dimensions.  Especially if you have limited space, you’ll want to pay close attention to the dimensions of each machine. Many treadmills also have folding mechanisms, allowing for easy storage.
Essential features.  Your needs for speed, incline, and the size of the running deck will likely depend on your height and whether you’re running or walking.  Speed.  Motorized treadmills usually have a maximum speed of 7–12 miles (11.3 – 19.3 km) per hour, while manual treadmills adjust to your pace. Incline.  Some treadmills feature manual or automatic incline and decline options, which can help you intensify your workouts and mimic running outdoors.  Running deck size.  While a 48-in. (121.9-cm) running deck will work for most runners, if you’re taller than 6 feet (182.9 cm) or have a long stride, you’ll want a deck that’s at least 54 in. (137.2 cm) long.

Display screen and streaming options.  Some treadmills allow you to connect your own device or have an LED, LCD, or touch screen so you can stream classes via Bluetooth.
