There are many different types, which vary in appearance, color, and flavor. Daikon radishes are popularly used in Asian and Indian cooking and known for their potent medicinal properties.
This article reviews daikon radish, including its nutrition, benefits, and culinary uses.

What is daikon?
Daikon — also known as luóbo and winter, white, oilseed, and icicle radish — is a variety of  radish  native to China and Japan ( 2 ).
It’s cultivated around the world as a food for people and livestock, as well as for its seed oil, which is used in the cosmetic industry. Farmers also plant it as a cover crop to improve soil health and increase crop yield ( 3 ).
Daikon is considered a winter radish, which is slower growing and larger than spring radishes. Winter radishes are sown in mid to late summer and harvested during cooler weather ( 4 ).
Daikon radishes have a crispy texture and resemble large  carrots . Their flavor is milder than that of other radish varieties and described as slightly sweet yet slightly spicy.
Though most commonly white with leafy green tops, daikon radishes come in a variety of hues, including red, green, and purple. They grow in three shapes — cylindrical, oblong, and spherical ( 1 ).
Here are some interesting varieties of daikon:
Miyashige White.  This daikon is white and has a cylindrical root that grows 16–18 inches (41–46 cm) long. It has a crisp texture and mild flavor.
KN-Bravo.  KN-Bravo is a beautiful daikon variety that has  purple  skin and light purple to white flesh. The roots can grow up to 6 inches (15 cm) long and have a slightly sweet flavor.
Alpine.  The Alpine daikon has short roots that grow 5–6 inches (13–15cm) long. This variety is a popular choice to make kimchi — a  fermented vegetable dish  — and has a sweeter taste than longer daikon varieties.
Watermelon radish.  This daikon variety has pale, greenish skin, yet reveals a bright pink flesh when cut open. It’s spherical and slightly sweet and peppery.
Japanese Minowase.  Minowase daikon is amongst the largest varieties, with roots growing up to 24 inches (61 cm) long. They’re white and have a sweet flavor and crunchy texture.
Shunkyo.  This cylindrical variety has red skin and white flesh. It grows 4–5 inches (10–12 cm) long and is known for its fiery yet sweet flavor and pink-stemmed leaves.
Daikon radishes are native to Asia but grown around the world. Varieties include Alpine, KN-Bravo, and Shunkyo. They all come with a unique shape, taste, and color.

Daikon nutrition
Daikon is a very-low-calorie vegetable yet has an impressive nutrient profile.
One 7-inch (18-cm) daikon weighing 12 ounces (338 grams) packs the following nutrients ( 5 ):
Calories:  61
Carbs:  14 grams
Protein:  2 grams
Fiber:  5 grams
Vitamin C:  124% of the Daily Value (DV)
Folate (B9):  24% of the DV
Calcium:  9% of the DV
Magnesium:  14% of the DV
Potassium:  22% of the DV
Copper:  19% of the DV
Daikon is an excellent source of various nutrients, including calcium, magnesium, potassium, and copper. Still, it’s  highest in vitamin C  and folate.
Vitamin C is a water-soluble nutrient that’s essential to health and needed for many bodily functions, including immune system function and tissue growth and repair ( 6 ).
Plus, it doubles as a powerful antioxidant, protecting your body’s cells from oxidative damage ( 6 ).
Daikon is also rich in folate, a B vitamin that’s involved in cellular growth, red blood cell production, and DNA synthesis ( 7 ).
Foods rich in folate  are particularly important during pregnancy, as this nutrient plays an integral role in the growth and development of the baby ( 8 ).
Daikon is low in calories yet high in many nutrients, particularly vitamin C and folate.

Potential health benefits
Eating nutrient-dense daikon may benefit your health in many ways.
Daikon contains many plant compounds that may improve health and offer protection against certain diseases.
One test-tube study found that daikon extract contained the polyphenol  antioxidants  ferulic acid and quercetin, both of which have anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and immune-boosting properties ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ).
Additionally, cruciferous vegetables like daikon offer biologically active compounds called glucosinolates, which break down to form isothiocyanates.
Test-tube and animal research shows that these compounds may provide powerful cancer-fighting properties ( 12 ,  13 ,  14 ).
Plus, population studies indicate that eating a lot of cruciferous vegetables like radishes may protect against certain cancers, including of the colon and lungs ( 15 ,  16 ).
Eating low-calorie, high-fiber foods like daikon can help you maintain a healthy weight or  lose weight  if that’s your goal.
Daikon is considered a non-starchy vegetable, meaning it’s very low in carbs. Research has demonstrated that eating non-starchy vegetables can promote a healthy body weight.
For example, a study in 1,197 people found that those who ate more  non-starchy vegetables  had less body fat and lower levels of insulin, a hormone involved in fat storage ( 17 ).
What’s more, daikon is high in fiber, a nutrient that may decrease hunger levels by slowing digestion and increasing fullness, which may help boost weight loss ( 18 ).
Daikon is a highly nutritious vegetable packed with potent plant compounds, vitamins, minerals, and fiber, all of which work together to protect your body against disease.
Though adding  more of any vegetable  to your diet can improve your health, eating cruciferous vegetables like daikon may particularly protect against a wide range of conditions.
In fact, cruciferous vegetable intake has been linked to a decreased risk of heart disease, certain cancers, diabetes, and neurodegenerative conditions ( 19 ,  20 ,  21 ,  22 ,  23 ).
Additionally, some population studies indicate that eating more cruciferous vegetables like daikon may help you live a longer, healthier life ( 24 ).
Daikon is a low-calorie, high-fiber vegetable that contains plant compounds that may help protect against conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.
