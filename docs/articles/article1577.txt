Title: 10 Gluten-Free Options at Dunkin’ Donuts

Whether you avoid gluten because of a gluten-related disorder, such as celiac disease, or because of a dietary preference, it’s helpful to do a little research before dining out. You may be wondering what gluten-free foods and drinks are available at Dunkin’ Donuts.
Gluten is a protein found in some grains, including wheat, rye, barley, farro, and spelt. It is common in baked goods such as breads, doughnuts, muffins, and pastries ( 1 ).
Cross contamination may occur during food production and preparation, so foods that you think are gluten-free may not be. To be on the safe side, it’s always a good idea to let the person taking your order know that you follow a gluten-free diet.
Unfortunately, none of the doughnuts or breakfast sandwiches at Dunkin’ Donuts are gluten-free. There is also no indication that Dunkin’ Donuts has plans to offer gluten-free bread options at any time in the future.
The gluten-free menu at Dunkin’ Donuts is pretty limited, but there are some food and drink options that are gluten-free.
Dunkin’ Donuts has nutrition and allergen information available on their website as well, but this guide will give you a great starting place when you don’t have time to scroll through all that information ( 2 ,  3 ).
At any restaurant, there’s always a risk of cross contamination. If you have celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, let your server know about your condition and ask about measures that are in place to specifically prevent gluten cross contamination.
Because Dunkin’ Donuts prepares many items that contain gluten, they advise that “any of our products may contain, or may have come in contact with, allergens including eggs, fish, milk, peanuts, shellfish, soy, tree nuts, and wheat.”

Tips for ordering gluten-free at Dunkin’ Donuts
Inform the person taking your order that you follow a gluten-free diet. If you have any other dietary preferences, be sure to include those, too, so they are aware.
Order ahead on the app. You can skip the stress of explaining your concerns in person by using the Dunkin’ Donuts app. Plus, you can save orders to repeat at your favorite Dunkin’ location to save yourself time.

The bottom line
Eating out with dietary restrictions can be tough. But it’s doable, especially if you can communicate your needs to your server and know which items fit your needs ahead of time.
Dunkin’ Donuts may not be the best choice for a meal if you follow a gluten-free diet — since there are limited food options and you won’t be able to order a doughnut — but it’s possible to have some items from the menu by using the tips provided and talking to your server.
