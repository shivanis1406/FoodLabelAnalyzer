Title: 15 Healthy Tailgate Food Options

A tailgate party is a perfect time to celebrate and enjoy delicious food with friends and family while supporting your favorite sports team.
Because foods like chips, hot dogs, cupcakes, and fried chicken tend to dominate tailgate menus, it can be hard to find nutritious options on game day.
Although there’s nothing wrong with enjoying these foods from time to time, some people may want to bring a more nutritious option to the party.
Fortunately, there are plenty of options for delicious and healthy tailgate-friendly foods that are sure to hit the spot and keep you and your friends fueled throughout the big game.
This article lists 15 healthy tailgate food options.

Recipes for large groups
If you’re heading to a large tailgate party, you’ll want to bring along a dish that can feed a crowd — like the following dishes.
Chili is a staple at tailgates, especially during colder weather.
While most chilis are tomato-based, this  white chicken chili  recipe from Well Plated by Erin is made with a base of chicken broth. It features nutritious ingredients like white beans, chicken breast, and garlic.
Because chicken breast is an excellent source of protein and since beans contain both protein and fiber, this dish is sure to keep you and your friends full throughout the game.
Adding sources of fiber and protein to meals and snacks can help you feel fuller for longer — which is essential when you need energy to root for your favorite team ( 1 ,  2 )!
The website allows you to double or even triple the recipe, which comes in handy when cooking for a large group.

It’s bursting with flavor from olives, onion, parsley, and feta and is high in plant-based protein thanks to the chickpeas. You can double or triple the recipe depending on how many people you’re planning to serve.
Skewers, also known as kabobs, are a perfect choice for a tailgate party. They’re versatile, easy to make, and are sure to please a crowd with different taste preferences.
