Title: The Top 9 Nuts to Eat for Better Health

Nuts may offer numerous health benefits, such as reducing your risk of heart disease and supporting your immune system. Some types of nuts include almonds, pistachios, and walnuts.
Nuts are a delicious snack that are crunchy and nutritious.
They’re a great source of:
fiber
antioxidants
vitamins and minerals
healthy fats
protein
There are many  benefits  of eating nuts,  such as  supporting healthy body weight and helping to reduce your risk of certain health conditions like  heart disease .
Nuts have various textures, flavors, and nutrient profiles. They’re great on their own, paired with fruit, or added to dishes like salads, desserts, and grains.
Here are 9 nutritious nuts to add to your diet.

1. Almonds
Almonds  are popular due to their flavor, impressive nutrient profile, and relatively cheap cost. You can eat them raw or roasted, and they’re often made into almond  butter ,  flour , and  milk .
A 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of roasted almonds  contains :
Calories:  170
Fat:  15 grams
Protein:  6 grams
Carbs:  6 grams
Fiber:  3 grams
Vitamin E:  45% of the Daily Value (DV)
Magnesium:  19% of the DV
Manganese:  27% of the DV
These nuts are especially rich in  vitamin E , a fat-soluble nutrient that functions as an antioxidant to protect your cells against oxidative damage. This vitamin also  supports  immune function and cellular communication.
Not only are almonds a nutrient-dense food, but they may also reduce heart disease risk factors.
A  12-week study  in 219 young adults found that those who ate 2 ounces (56 grams) of almonds daily had significant reductions in  LDL (bad) cholesterol , inflammatory markers, and  hemoglobin A1c  — a marker of blood sugar control — compared with a control group.
Almonds may also  promote gut health  by supporting the growth of  beneficial gut bacteria , including  Bifidobacteria  and  Lactobacillus  species.
Almonds are high in several essential nutrients. Eating them regularly may boost heart and gut health.

2. Pistachios
Pistachios  — whose name is derived from the Greek word pistákion, which means “the green nut” — have been eaten since  6,000 B.C .
These vibrant nuts are packed with nutrients but lower in calories and fat than many other nuts.
Just 1 ounce (28 grams) of pistachios  contains :
Calories:  159
Fat:  13 grams
Protein:  6 grams
Carbs:  8 grams
Fiber:  3 grams
Vitamin B1 (thiamine):  21% of the DV
Vitamin B6:  28% of the DV
Phosphorus:  11% of the DV
Pistachios are a good source of numerous nutrients, including  vitamin B6 , which your  body needs  for nutrient metabolism and immune function.
These nuts are also rich in plant compounds that may have  antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties , including:
carotenoids  lutein and zeaxanthin
anthocyanins
flavonoids
proanthocyanidins
In a  4-month study  including 100 people with overweight, one group ate 1.5 ounces (42 grams) of pistachios per day and underwent a group-based behavioral weight loss program, while the other group only participated in the weight loss program.
The groups lost similar amounts of weight, but the pistachio group experienced significant reductions in blood pressure and increases in blood antioxidant levels.
Pistachios are a good source of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds. Plus, they may improve blood pressure and other health markers.

blood pressure
LDL cholesterol
triglycerides
Walnuts are also significantly higher in ALA  omega-3 fatty acids  than any other nut, with  2.57 grams  per ounce.
Additionally,  human and animal research  suggests that eating 1–2 ounces (28–57 grams) of walnuts per day may improve brain function and reduce risk factors for dementia, such as heart disease and  type 2 diabetes .
Although these findings are promising, more studies are needed.
Walnuts, which are an especially good source of copper and manganese, may boost heart and brain health.

4. Cashews
Cashews  have a crunchy texture and creamy mouthfeel that pair well with both savory and sweet dishes. You can eat them raw, roasted, or as nut butter.

Magnesium:  20% of the DV
Manganese:  20% of the DV
These nuts are a good source of several nutrients that are essential to bone health,  including :
protein
vitamin K
magnesium
manganese
A  review of five studies  also found that eating cashews led to reductions in blood pressure and triglyceride levels.
That said,  other studies  have observed mixed results, so more research is needed.
Some studies suggest that cashews may improve blood fat levels and reduce blood pressure. They also provide vitamin K and minerals like magnesium and manganese.

5. Pecans
