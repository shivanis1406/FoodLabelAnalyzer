Title: 12 High Carb Foods That Are Incredibly Healthy

Over the years, carbohydrates have gotten a bad reputation. People often associate them with weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and a variety of other health conditions.
Yes, it’s true that processed foods high in sugar and refined grains typically lack important vitamins and minerals. However, many nutrient-dense, fiber-rich foods can actually be very good for you.
While low carb diets can be beneficial for some people, there’s no reason to avoid high carb foods altogether.
Here are 12 high carb foods that are incredibly healthy.

1. Quinoa
Quinoa  is a nutritious seed that has become incredibly popular among health-conscious consumers.
It’s classified as a pseudocereal, which is a seed that’s prepared and eaten like a grain.
Cooked quinoa contains 70% carbs, making it a high carb food. However, it’s also a good source of protein and fiber ( 1 ).
Quinoa is rich in many minerals and plant compounds and has been linked to a variety of health benefits, including improved blood sugar management and heart health ( 2 ,  3 ).
Additionally, it does not contain any gluten, which makes it a popular alternative to wheat for those on a  gluten-free diet .
Quinoa is also very filling since it’s relatively high in fiber and protein. For this reason, it may help promote healthy weight management and gut health ( 4 ,  5 ).
Quinoa is highly nutritious and may help improve blood sugar management and support heart health. Quinoa is also high in protein and fiber, so it may be useful for weight loss, as both of these nutrients can help keep you feeling full for longer.

2. Oats
Oats  are an incredibly healthy whole grain and a great source of many vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
Raw oats contain 70% carbs. A 1-cup (81-gram) serving contains 54 grams of carbs, including 8 grams of fiber. They are particularly high in a specific type of fiber called oat beta glucan ( 6 ,  7 ).
Oats are also a relatively good source of  protein  and contain more protein than most grains ( 8 ).
Research suggests that eating oats may reduce your risk of heart disease by lowering your cholesterol levels ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ).
Eating oats may also lower blood sugar levels, especially in people with type 2 diabetes ( 12 ).
Furthermore, oats are very filling, which could help support healthy weight management ( 13 ,  14 ).
Oats contain many beneficial nutrients, including fiber and protein. Studies have also shown that eating oats lowers blood sugar and cholesterol levels.

3. Buckwheat
Like quinoa,  buckwheat  is considered a pseudocereal. Despite its name, buckwheat is not related to wheat and does not contain gluten.
Raw buckwheat contains 75 grams of carbs, while cooked buckwheat groats contain about 19.9 grams of carbs per 100-gram serving ( 15 ,  16 ).
Buckwheat is very nutritious, containing both protein and fiber. It also has more minerals and antioxidants than many other grains ( 17 ).
Additionally, studies in humans and animals suggest that it may be particularly beneficial for  heart health  and blood sugar regulation ( 18 ,  19 ).
Buckwheat is highly nutritious and contains more antioxidants and minerals than many grains. Buckwheat isn’t related to wheat and doesn’t contain gluten. Eating it may benefit your heart health and blood sugar regulation.

4. Bananas
Bananas  are a popular fruit people love to use in many different recipes.
One large banana (136 grams) contains about 31 grams of carbs, either in the form of starches or sugars ( 20 ).
Bananas are also high in  potassium  and vitamins B6 and C, and they contain several beneficial plant compounds ( 20 ).
Thanks to their high content of potassium, bananas may help lower blood pressure and improve heart health ( 21 ).
Unripe, green bananas are higher in starch. This transforms into natural sugars as the bananas ripen, turning yellow in the process. Thus, you’ll tend to get more starch and less sugar if you eat your bananas when they’re less ripe ( 22 ).
Unripe and less ripe bananas also contain decent amounts of  resistant starch  and pectin, both of which support digestive health and provide fuel for the beneficial bacteria in your gut ( 23 ,  24 ).
Bananas are high in potassium, a mineral that plays a key role in regulating blood pressure. Less ripe bananas also contain resistant starch and pectin, both of which can improve digestive health.

5. Sweet potatoes
Sweet potatoes are a delicious, nutritious tuber or root vegetable.
One-half cup (100 grams) of mashed, cooked sweet potatoes with their skin on contains about 20.7 grams of carbs, which consists of starch, sugar, and  fiber  ( 25 ).
Sweet potatoes  are also a rich source of vitamin A, vitamin C, and potassium ( 25 ).
What’s more, they’re packed with antioxidants, which are compounds that help neutralize harmful free radicals in your cells to protect you against chronic disease ( 26 ,  27 ).
Sweet potatoes are an excellent source of vitamin A, along with several other vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.

6. Beets
Beets  are a purple root vegetable that people sometimes refer to as beetroots.
While they aren’t considered high in carbs overall, they do have a lot for a non-starchy vegetable. Raw and cooked beets contain about 10 grams of carbs per 100 grams, mainly from sugar and fiber ( 28 ,  29 ).
They’re also packed with vitamins and minerals, along with powerful antioxidants and plant compounds ( 30 ).
Beets are also high in inorganic nitrates, which are converted into  nitric oxide  in your body. Nitric oxide lowers blood pressure and may decrease the risk of several diseases ( 31 ,  32 ).
Beet juice is also very high in nitrates, and athletes sometimes use it to enhance their physical performance ( 33 ,  34 ,  35 ).
That’s because nitric oxide relaxes your blood vessels, allowing oxygen to flow more efficiently during exercise.
Beets are loaded with vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds. They also contain high amounts of inorganic nitrates, which can improve heart health and boost physical performance.

7. Oranges
Oranges  are a popular type of citrus fruit.
They’re mainly composed of water and made up of about 15.5 grams of carbs per 100-gram serving. Oranges are also a good source of fiber ( 36 ).
Oranges are especially rich in  vitamin C , potassium, and some B vitamins. In addition, they contain citric acid, as well as several potent plant compounds and antioxidants ( 37 ).
Eating oranges may improve heart health and help prevent kidney stones. They may also increase the absorption of iron from other foods you eat, which may help protect against iron deficiency anemia ( 38 ,  39 ,  40 ,  41 ).
