Title: The 18 Healthiest Fast Foods You Can Eat



Finding healthy fast food can be a challenge. Here are 18 healthy options for meals you can order at fast food restaurants including Saladworks, Chick-fil-A, and McDonald’s.
Fast food has a reputation for being unhealthy and high in calories, salt and fat.
Thankfully, there are exceptions. Although many fast foods have been processed, refined or deep-fried, some fast food restaurants now offer healthy options.
To make a healthier selection, look for items that include vegetables, lean sources of protein or whole grains. Additionally, opting for foods that are grilled or baked rather than fried can significantly reduce the calories and fat in your meal.
Here are 18 healthy fast foods that you can enjoy guilt-free. Some restaurants have more healthy options than others, so these will appear more than once.

1. Saladworks: Farmhouse Salad

This salad delivers an impressive 5 grams of fiber, which can fulfill up to 20% of  your daily needs .
Top this salad with your choice of vinaigrette dressing to keep it light yet delicious.

In addition to egg whites, these bites contain Monterey Jack cheese, spinach and fire-roasted red peppers. Each serving squeezes in 13 grams of protein.
Some studies have found that a high-protein breakfast  may help with weight loss .
A 2015 study compared 57 young adults who either skipped breakfast or ate a high- or normal-protein breakfast.
The high-protein breakfast group experienced reduced hunger and food intake throughout the day, and gained less body fat compared to the no-breakfast and normal-protein breakfast groups ( 5 ).

Look for foods that include a good source of protein, heart-healthy fats, whole grains and vegetables to ensure that you’re getting a well-rounded and nutritious meal.
You’ll enjoy your meal guilt-free, and your body will thank you.
