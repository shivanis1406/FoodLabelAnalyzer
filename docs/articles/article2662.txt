Title: The Ketogenic Diet: A Detailed Beginner’s Guide to Keto

The ketogenic diet involves consuming a very low amount of carbohydrates and replacing them with fat to help your body burn fat for energy. Health benefits can include weight loss and lowering your risk for certain diseases.
The ketogenic diet (or keto diet, for short) is a low carb, high fat diet that offers many health benefits.
In fact, many studies show that this type of diet can help you lose weight and improve your health ( 1 ).
Ketogenic diets may even have benefits against diabetes, cancer, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s disease ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
Here is a detailed beginner’s guide to the keto diet.

What are the basic rules for keto?
The ketogenic diet is a very low carb, high fat diet that shares many similarities with the  Atkins  and  low carb  diets.
It involves drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat. This reduction in carbs puts your body into a metabolic state called  ketosis .
When this happens, your body becomes incredibly efficient at  burning fat  for energy. It also turns fat into  ketones  in the liver, which can supply energy for the brain ( 6 ).
Ketogenic diets can cause significant reductions in blood sugar and insulin levels. This, along with the increased ketones, has some health benefits ( 6 ,  7 ,  8 ).
The keto diet is a low carb, high fat diet. It lowers blood sugar and insulin levels and shifts the body’s metabolism away from carbs and toward fat and ketones.

What do I eat on the keto diet?
There are several versions of the ketogenic diet, and what you eat depends on the type. They include:
Standard ketogenic diet (SKD):  This is a very low carb, moderate protein and high fat diet. It typically contains 70% fat, 20% protein, and only 10% carbs ( 9 ).
Cyclical ketogenic diet (CKD):  This diet involves periods of higher carb refeeds, such as 5 ketogenic days followed by 2 high carb days.
Targeted ketogenic diet (TKD):  This diet allows you to add carbs around workouts.
High protein ketogenic diet:  This is similar to a standard ketogenic diet, but includes more  protein . The ratio is often 60% fat, 35% protein, and 5% carbs.
However, only the standard and high protein ketogenic diets have been studied extensively. Cyclical or targeted ketogenic diets are more advanced methods and primarily used by bodybuilders or athletes.
The information in this article mostly applies to the standard ketogenic diet (SKD), although many of the same principles also apply to the other versions.
There are several versions of the keto diet. The standard (SKD) version is the most researched and most recommended.

What is ketosis?
Ketosis  is a metabolic state in which your body uses fat for fuel instead of carbs.
It occurs when you significantly reduce your consumption of carbohydrates, limiting your body’s supply of glucose (sugar), which is the main source of energy for the cells.
Following a ketogenic diet is the most effective way to enter ketosis. Generally, this involves limiting carb consumption to around 20 to 50 grams per day and filling up on fats, such as meat, fish, eggs, nuts, and healthy oils ( 6 ).
It’s also important to moderate your protein consumption. This is because protein can be converted into glucose if consumed in high amounts, which may slow your transition into ketosis ( 10 ).
Practicing  intermittent fasting  could also help you enter ketosis faster. There are many different forms of intermittent fasting, but the most common method involves limiting food intake to around 8 hours per day and fasting for the remaining 16 hours ( 11 ).
Blood, urine, and breath  tests  are available, which can help determine whether you’ve entered ketosis by measuring the amount of ketones produced by your body.
Certain symptoms  may also indicate that you’ve entered ketosis, including increased thirst, dry mouth, frequent urination, and decreased hunger or appetite ( 12 ).
Ketosis is a metabolic state in which your body uses fat for fuel instead of carbs. Modifying your diet and practicing intermittent fasting can help you enter ketosis faster. Certain tests and symptoms can also help determine whether you’ve entered ketosis.

Can the keto diet help me lose weight?
A ketogenic diet is an effective way to lose weight and lower risk factors for disease ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
In fact, research shows that the ketogenic diet may be as effective for weight loss as a  low fat diet  ( 13 ,  14 ,  15 ).
What’s more, the diet is so filling that you can  lose weight  without counting calories or tracking your food intake ( 16 ).
One review of 13 studies found that following a very low carb, ketogenic diet was slightly more effective for long-term weight loss than a  low fat diet . People who followed the keto diet lost an average of 2 pounds (0.9 kg) more than the group that followed a low fat diet ( 13 ).
What’s more, it also led to reductions in diastolic  blood pressure  and  triglyceride levels  ( 13 ).
Another study in 34 older adults found that those who followed a ketogenic diet for 8 weeks lost nearly five times as much total body fat as those who followed a low fat diet ( 17 ).
The increased ketones, lower blood sugar levels, and improved insulin sensitivity may also play a key role ( 18 ,  19 ).
For more details on the weight loss effects of a ketogenic diet, read  this article .
A ketogenic diet can help you lose slightly more weight than a low fat diet. This often happens with less hunger.

Discover more about Type 2 Diabetes

Is the keto diet good for people with diabetes and prediabetes?
Diabetes is characterized by changes in metabolism, high blood sugar, and impaired  insulin function  ( 20 ).
The ketogenic diet can help you lose excess fat, which is closely linked to  type 2 diabetes ,  prediabetes , and  metabolic syndrome  ( 21 ,  22 ,  23 ,  24 ).
One older study found that the ketogenic diet improved insulin sensitivity by a whopping 75% ( 25 ).
A small study in women with type 2 diabetes also found that following a ketogenic diet for 90 days significantly reduced levels of hemoglobin A1C, which is a measure of long-term blood sugar management ( 26 ).
Another study in 349 people with type 2 diabetes found that those who followed a ketogenic diet lost an average of 26.2 pounds (11.9 kg) over a 2-year period. This is an important benefit when considering the link between weight and type 2 diabetes ( 24 ,  27 ).
What’s more, they also experienced improved blood sugar management, and the use of certain blood sugar medications decreased among participants throughout the course of the study ( 27 ).
For more information, check out  this article  on the benefits of low carb diets for people with diabetes.
The ketogenic diet can boost insulin sensitivity and cause fat loss, leading to significant health benefits for people with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes.

What are the other benefits of the keto diet?
The ketogenic diet actually originated as a tool for  treating neurological diseases  such as epilepsy.
Studies have now shown that the diet can have benefits for a wide variety of different health conditions:
Heart disease.  The ketogenic diet can help improve risk factors like  body fat , HDL (good) cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and blood sugar ( 28 ,  29 ).
Cancer.  The diet is currently being explored as an additional treatment for cancer, because it may help slow tumor growth. ( 4 ,  30 ,  31 ).
Alzheimer’s disease.  The keto diet may help reduce symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and slow its progression ( 5 ,  32 ,  33 ).
Epilepsy.  Research has shown that the ketogenic diet can cause significant reductions in seizures in epileptic children ( 3 ).
Parkinson’s disease.  Although more research is needed, one study found that the diet helped improve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease ( 34 ).
Polycystic ovary syndrome.  The ketogenic diet can help reduce insulin levels, which may play a key role in polycystic ovary syndrome ( 35 ,  36 ).
Brain injuries.  Some research suggests that the diet could improve outcomes of traumatic brain injuries ( 37 ).
However, keep in mind that research into many of these areas is far from conclusive.
A ketogenic diet may provide many health benefits, especially with metabolic, neurological, or insulin-related diseases.

Keto tips and tricks
Although getting started on the ketogenic diet can be challenging, there are several tips and tricks that you can use to make it easier.
Start by familiarizing yourself with  food labels  and checking the grams of fat, carbs, and fiber to determine how your favorite foods can fit into your diet.
Planning out your meals  in advance may also be beneficial and can help you save extra time throughout the week.
Many websites, food blogs,  apps , and cookbooks also offer keto-friendly recipes and meal ideas that you can use to build your own custom menu.
Alternatively, some  meal delivery services  even offer keto-friendly options for a quick and convenient way to enjoy keto meals at home.
Look into  healthy frozen keto meals  when you’re short on time
When going to social gatherings or visiting family and friends, you may also want to consider bringing your own food, which can make it much easier to curb cravings and stick to your meal plan.
Reading food labels, planning your meals ahead, and bringing your own foods when visiting family and friends can make it much easier to stick to the ketogenic diet.

Tips for eating out on a ketogenic diet
Many restaurant meals can be  made keto-friendly .
Most restaurants offer some kind of meat or fish-based dish. Order this and replace any high carb food with extra vegetables.
Egg-based meals are also a great option, such as an omelet or eggs and bacon.
Another favorite is  bun-less burgers . You could also swap the fries for vegetables instead. Add extra avocado, cheese, bacon, or eggs.
At Mexican restaurants, you can enjoy any type of meat with extra cheese, guacamole, salsa, and sour cream.
For dessert, ask for a mixed cheese board or berries with cream.
When eating out, select a meat-, fish-, or egg-based dish. Order extra veggies instead of carbs or starches, and have cheese for dessert.

Side effects and how to minimize them
Although the ketogenic diet is usually safe for most healthy people, there may be some initial side effects while your body adapts.
There’s some anecdotal evidence of these effects often referred to as the  keto flu  ( 38 ). Based on reports from some on the eating plan, it’s usually over within a few days.
Reported keto flu symptoms include diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting ( 39 ). Other less common symptoms include:
poor energy and mental function
increased hunger
sleep issues
nausea
digestive discomfort
decreased exercise performance
To minimize this, you can try a regular low carb diet for the first few weeks. This may teach your body to burn more fat before you completely eliminate carbs.
A ketogenic diet can also change the water and mineral balance of your body, so adding extra salt to your meals or taking mineral supplements may help. Talk to your doctor about your nutritional needs.
At least in the beginning, it’s important to eat until you’re full and avoid restricting calories too much. Usually, a ketogenic diet causes weight loss without intentional calorie restriction.
Many of the side effects of starting a ketogenic diet can be limited. Easing into the diet and taking mineral supplements can help.

Does being on the keto diet have any risks?
While the keto diet has its benefits, staying on it in the long term may have  some negative effects , including risks of the following:
low protein in the blood
extra fat in the liver
kidney stones
micronutrient deficiencies
A type of medication called sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for type 2 diabetes can increase the risk for  diabetic ketoacidosis , a dangerous condition that increases blood acidity. Anyone taking this medication should avoid the keto diet ( 40 ,  41 ).
More research is being done to determine the safety of the keto diet in the long term. Keep your doctor informed of your eating plan to guide your choices.
There are some side effects to the keto diet about which you should speak to your doctor if you plan to stay on the diet long term.

Are there supplements for a keto diet?
Although no supplements are required, some can be useful.
MCT oil . Added to drinks or yogurt,  MCT oil  provides energy and helps increase ketone levels.  Shop for MCT oil online  ( 42 ,  43 ).
Minerals.  Added salt and other minerals can be important when starting out due to shifts in water and mineral balance ( 44 ).
Caffeine .  Caffeine  can have benefits for energy, fat loss, and performance ( 45 ).
Exogenous ketones . This supplement may help raise the body’s ketone levels ( 46 ).
Creatine .  Creatine  provides numerous benefits for health and performance. This can help if you are combining a ketogenic diet with exercise ( 47 ).
Whey . Use half a scoop of  whey protein  in shakes or yogurt to increase your daily protein intake ( 48 ,  49 ).  Shop for tasty whey products on online .
Certain supplements can be beneficial on a ketogenic diet. These include exogenous ketones, MCT oil, and minerals.

Frequently asked questions
Here are answers to some of the most common questions about the ketogenic diet.
Yes. However, it’s important to significantly reduce your carb intake initially. After the first 2 to 3 months, you can eat carbs on special occasions — just return to the diet immediately after.
There’s a risk of losing some muscle on any diet. However, protein intake and high ketone levels may help minimize muscle loss, especially if you lift weights ( 50 ,  51 ).
Yes, but it may not work as well as on a moderate carb diet ( 52 ,  53 ).  For more details about low carb or keto diets and exercise performance, read  this article .
Protein should be moderate, as a very high intake can spike insulin levels and lower ketones. Around 35% of total calorie intake is probably the upper limit.
You may not be in full ketosis or be utilizing fats and ketones efficiently. To counter this, lower your carb intake and revisit the points above. A supplement like MCT oil or ketones may also help ( 42 ,  43 ).
Don’t be alarmed. This is simply due to the excretion of by-products created during ketosis ( 54 ).
This is a common side effect. Try drinking naturally flavored water or chewing sugar-free gum.
People often confuse ketosis with  ketoacidosis . Ketoacidosis is dangerous, but ketosis on a ketogenic diet is usually fine for healthy people. Speak to your doctor before starting any new diet.
This common side effect usually passes after 3 to 4 weeks. If it persists, try eating more high fiber veggies ( 55 ,  56 ).
People often refer to the ketogenic diet colloquially as the keto diet, so these terms refer to the same thing.
In the first week of the keto diet, the weight you lose is typically water weight. Anecdotally, people report losing about 1 lb (0.5 kg) to 10 lb or more (5 kg).
Learn more about  weight loss after 1 week on keto .
A ketogenic diet can be great for people who:
are overweight
have diabetes
are looking to improve their metabolic health
It may be less suitable for elite athletes or those wishing to add large amounts of muscle or weight.
It may also not be sustainable for some people’s lifestyles and preferences. Speak with your doctor about your eating plan and goals to decide if a keto eating plan is right for you.

The bottom line
While following the ketogenic diet, you reduce your carbohydrate intake and replace it with healthy fats. This can help your body to use fat for energy, encouraging weight loss and possibly reducing the chance of developing certain health issues.
That said, consult your doctor prior to engaging in the diet for an extended period of time, as it may have some side effects. More research is needed to understand its long-term effect on the body.
