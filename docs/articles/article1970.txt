Title: What Does Melatonin Do, and How Does It Work?

There is strong evidence that melatonin has benefits for sleep. It may increase the duration and quality of your sleep and help with insomnia. Dosage determines how it will affect your sleep.
Melatonin is a hormone that your body makes naturally. It’s  produced by  the pineal gland in the brain, but it’s also found in other areas, such as the eyes, bone marrow, and gut.
It’s often called the sleep hormone, as high levels can help you fall asleep.
However, melatonin itself won’t put you to sleep. It simply  lets your body know  that it’s time for bed so that you can relax and fall asleep more easily.
Here’s what the research says about its benefits, as well as potential side effects and risks for certain populations.

How does melatonin work?
Melatonin  works  in tandem with your body’s  circadian rhythm .
In simple terms, the circadian rhythm is your body’s internal clock. It lets you know when it’s time to:
sleep
wake
eat
Melatonin also  helps  regulate  blood pressure, blood glucose, body weight, hormone levels , and  body temperature .
Your melatonin levels start to rise when it’s dark outside, signaling to your body that it’s time to sleep. They then decrease in the morning, when it’s light outside, to promote wakefulness.
Because melatonin helps your body prepare for sleep, people who don’t make enough of it at night can have trouble falling asleep.
Many factors  may cause  low melatonin levels at night, such as alcohol consumption, smoking, caffeine consumption, shift work, aging, certain medications, and exposure to too much light at night — including  blue light .
Taking a melatonin supplement may help counter low levels and normalize your internal clock, but it’s important to speak with a doctor first to determine if it’s the best option for you.

Taking melatonin for sleep may help
Strong evidence suggests that taking melatonin before bed decreases sleep latency — the time it takes to fall asleep — while increasing total sleep time.
A  2019 review  of 11 studies demonstrated that taking melatonin before bed decreased sleep latency by almost 3 minutes and increased total sleep time by about 30 minutes, compared with a placebo.
A  2021 review  of 23 studies involving people with disease-related sleep disorders found that melatonin significantly reduced sleep disturbances and sleep latency while increasing sleep duration and quality.
Additionally, melatonin may  counteract jet lag , a temporary sleep disorder.
Jet lag occurs when your body’s internal clock is out of sync with a new time zone. Shift workers  may also  experience jet lag symptoms because they work during hours that are normally used for sleep.
Melatonin may help  reduce jet lag  by syncing your internal clock with the time change.
Before using melatonin, though, try  implementing healthy sleep habits , such as establishing a consistent sleep schedule, limiting alcohol and caffeine consumption, and reducing your exposure to light and electronic devices before bed.

Additional melatonin health benefits
In addition to improving sleep, melatonin may help manage other health conditions.
Eye health:   Research from 2019  found that melatonin supplements may reduce age-related macular degeneration by neutralizing free radicals and decreasing inflammation due to its antioxidant effects in the body.
Acid reflux and GERD:  Melatonin  may help  alleviate acid reflux and gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) by protecting the lining of your esophagus — the tube that connects your throat and stomach — against irritants such as acid, alcohol, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Tinnitus:   Researchers  suggest that taking melatonin may help reduce symptoms of significant tinnitus, a condition characterized by ringing in the ears.
Migraine attacks:  Several prescription drugs help  treat migraine , but melatonin may also  offer relief  due to its ability to inhibit pain sensations.
Brain health:  Some  studies  suggest that melatonin improves sleep quality and morning alertness in individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Still, more research is needed to understand melatonin’s effect on the brain.

How to take melatonin
If you’re considering trying melatonin for insomnia, start with a low dose supplement.
For instance, start with 0.5 to 1 milligrams (mg) 30 minutes before going to bed. If that doesn’t seem to help you fall asleep, try increasing your dose to 3 to 5 mg.
Taking melatonin in excess of 5 mg is unlikely to help you fall asleep faster. The goal is to find the lowest dose that helps you sleep.
However, it’s best to follow the instructions that come with your supplement and to talk with a healthcare professional before adding over-the-counter melatonin to your routine.
Because melatonin comes in different forms, you may also want to consult a doctor or pharmacist about the best form for you.

Melatonin side effects
Current  evidence  suggests that melatonin supplements are safe, nontoxic, and not addictive for either children or adults.
Supplementing with melatonin long term is also likely safe.  Studies  have found no significant adverse events associated with daily melatonin intake in dosages of 2 to 10 mg for up to 3.5 years.
Unlike other hormones, no evidence suggests that taking melatonin affects your body’s natural ability to make its own.
However, several minor,  short-lived side effects  of melatonin supplements have been reported,  including :
daytime sleepiness
fatigue
dizziness
headaches
nausea
a cold feeling

Melatonin interactions
Despite its relatively strong safety profile, melatonin may interact with a variety of medications by either altering their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.
Medications that melatonin may interact with include:
sleep aids or sedatives
blood thinners
anticonvulsants
blood pressure medications
antidepressants
oral contraceptives
diabetes medications
immunosuppressants
If you have a health condition or take any of the above medications, talk with your doctor before starting to use melatonin.
Melatonin may also interact with alcohol. Some  research from 2024  suggests that moderate to heavy alcohol use reduces melatonin levels and thus disrupts sleep quality, though results are mixed.

Melatonin and pregnancy
Your natural melatonin levels are important  during pregnancy .
During pregnancy, melatonin  transfers  to your developing baby. Melatonin contributes to the development of circadian rhythms and both the nervous and endocrine systems.
Melatonin also appears to  protect  the fetal nervous system. It’s believed that this hormone’s antioxidant effects safeguard the baby’s developing nervous system from damage due to  oxidative stress .
While it’s clear that melatonin is important over the course of a pregnancy, few studies have examined melatonin supplementation during pregnancy.
As such, taking melatonin supplements during pregnancy is  not recommended .
Additionally, although melatonin is a natural component of breast milk, no data exists on the safety of melatonin supplementation during breastfeeding. For this reason, using melatonin supplements while nursing is  also not recommended .

Melatonin and children
The effectiveness of  melatonin in children and adolescents  is still being investigated.
A  2019 review  on melatonin use in children and adolescents found that children receiving melatonin as a short-term treatment fell asleep faster and slept longer than children receiving a placebo.
A  2018 study  followed up with 69 people who had been using melatonin since childhood, for about 11 years. It found that their sleep quality wasn’t notably different from that of a control group who hadn’t used melatonin. This suggests their sleep issues normalized over time.
Melatonin is well tolerated in children. While  some research  suggests that long-term melatonin use may delay puberty — because a natural decline in evening melatonin levels is associated with the onset of puberty — more studies are needed.
Melatonin  supplements for children  are often sold in the form of gummies.
Some health experts  recommend  1 mg for infants, 2.5 to 3 mg for older children, and 5 mg for young adults.
Additionally, because researchers don’t yet understand the long-term effects of melatonin use in children, it may be best to help your kids  implement good sleep practices  first before trying melatonin.

The bottom line
Melatonin is an effective supplement that may help you fall asleep, especially if you have  insomnia  or jet lag. It may also offer other health benefits.
If you’re considering melatonin, talk with a doctor or pharmacist first to find out whether it’s right for you and whether it might interact with any medications you’re taking.
Then, you can start with a low dose of 0.5 to 1 mg 30 minutes before bed. If that doesn’t help, try increasing your dose to 3 to 5 mg.
Melatonin is generally well tolerated, although  mild side effects  are possible.
