Title: 5 Higher Fat Foods That Are Low Carb-Friendly

If you’re wanting to lose weight, a low carb diet may help you meet your goal. Avocados and nuts are two foods that are lower in carbs. Read on for more satisfying low carb foods.
There are numerous satisfying, higher fat foods that you can eat on a low carb or keto-friendly diet. Here are five of these foods.

1. Butter (and other high fat dairy products)
Butter  has been making a comeback as a health food, especially among people following a low carb diet.
If adding butter to your diet, consider choosing  grass-fed options . A  2021 study  found that grass-fed animal products like butter are higher in phytonutrients. However, more research is needed to determine the benefits these phytonutrients may have.
Also keep in mind that butter should be eaten with a meal, not as a meal. Replacing breakfast with  butter in your coffee  is not a good idea.
A pat of  salted butter  [around 5 grams (g)] contains:
Calories:  35.8
Protein:  0.043 g
Net   carbs:  0.003 g
Fat:  4.06 g
Other high fat dairy foods like  cheese  can be a good option if you’re on a low carb diet. Cheese also has protein, which can keep you feeling full for longer.

2. Nuts and nut butters
Nuts  are loaded with healthy fats and important nutrients, like vitamin E and magnesium.
A  2022 study  following 124,329 adults for 9.5 years found that those who ate nuts on a regular basis had a lower risk of death.
Nut butters made of only nuts and salt can also be a satisfying, low carb snack. Avoid nut butters that contain processed vegetable oils or sugar, though.
1 ounce (oz) of  lightly salted mixed nuts  contains:
Calories:  172
Protein:  5.67 g
Net carbs:  3.97 g
Fat:  15.3 g

3. Dark chocolate
Dark chocolate  contains fiber and powerful antioxidants.
A  2024 study  found that it can lower blood pressure and regulate cholesterol levels. One  2018 study  found that it may help promote weight loss.
Another  2024 study  showed that dark chocolate consumption was strongly associated with a reduced risk of  essential hypertension . However, it was not strongly associated with any other cardiovascular diseases.
Chocolate often contains  sugar . Try to choose chocolates with a high cocoa content (70% to 85%) to decrease the amount of sugar you are consuming.
1 oz of  70% to 85% dark chocolate  contains:
Calories:  170
Protein:  2.21 g
Net carbs:  9.91 g
Fat:  12.1 g

4. Pork rinds
Pork rinds, which are basically fried pork skin, are high in glycine.
Glycine is an amino acid. According to  research from 2024 , glycine may improve insulin response, oxidative stress, and inflammation in adults. It may also have positive effects on cardiovascular health.
Pork rinds are high in monounsaturated oleic acid, the same fatty acid found in abundance in  olive oil .  Researchers  suggest that oleic acid reduces certain markers of inflammation in humans.
1 oz (28 g) of  pork rinds  contains:
Calories:  154
Protein : 17.4 g
Net carbs : 0 g
Fat:  8.87 g

5. Avocados
Avocados  are another nutritious, low carb plant food. They’re high in nutrients, especially fiber and potassium.
Over 60%  of an avocado’s fat is monounsaturated, with small amounts of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids.
A  2022 study  found that avocado consumption was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease.
A  2021 review  of 19 clinical trials and 5 observational studies found that avocados may reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides, lower the risk of having overweight or obesity, and improve cognitive function. Avocados may also improve cognitive function and reduce visceral fat tissue in women with overweight or obesity.
A half (100 g) of an avocado contains:
Calories:  161
Protein:  2.01 g
Net carbs:  1.83 g
Fat:  14.75 g

Takeaway
If you’re following a low carb diet, aim to eat unprocessed, whole foods. This includes meats, fish,  eggs , vegetables, nuts, seeds, healthy fats, and fruit.
You can still eat many higher fat, satisfying foods — such as those listed here — while following a low carb or ketogenic diet. Be sure to consume them in moderation if you’re following a  weight loss plan .
