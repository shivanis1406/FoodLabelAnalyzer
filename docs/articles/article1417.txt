Title: 16 Ways to Motivate Yourself to Lose Weight

Motivation for weight loss can vary from person to person. It can involve identifying why you want to lose weight, setting expectations, and finding support.
Starting and sticking to a healthy  weight loss plan  can sometimes seem impossible.

Before you begin your weight loss journey
Clearly define all the reasons you want to lose weight and write them down. This will help you stay committed and motivated to reach your weight loss goals.
Try to read through your reasons daily and use them as a reminder when tempted to stray from your weight loss plans.
Many people start losing weight because their doctor suggests it, but research shows that people are more successful if their  weight loss motivation  comes from within.
Setting and accomplishing achievable goals may lead to feelings of accomplishment.
Many diets and diet products claim quick and easy weight loss. However, most practitioners recommend only losing  1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kg)  per week for 6 months.
A moderate amount of  weight loss of 5% to 10%  can have a major impact on your health.
That’s 9 to 18 pounds (4 to 8 kg) if you weigh 180 pounds (82 kg), and 13 to 25 pounds (6 to 11 kg) if you weigh 250 pounds (113 kg).
Research  shows that those who make a commitment, such as in the form of a contract, may improve their short-term weight loss outcome and dietary changes.
Some weight management apps offer push notifications to remind you to stick to your goals.
If it’s within your budget, consider investing in a gym membership or purchasing a package of exercise classes. You may be more likely to follow through if you’ve already made an investment.
Find a weight loss plan that you can stick to, and avoid plans that would be nearly impossible to follow in the long term.
Reducing your  calorie intake  may lead to weight loss, but dieting, especially frequent yo-yo dieting, may be a predictor of  future weight regain .
Avoid strict diets that completely eliminate certain foods. Research has found that those with an “ all or nothing ” mindset are less likely to lose weight or see their desired outcome.
Instead, consider creating a custom plan. The following  dietary habits  have been found to help people lose weight:
decreasing calorie intake
reducing portion sizes
reducing frequency of snacking
reducing ultra-processed food intake  (packaged desserts, sugary sweets, etc.)
incorporating more fruits and vegetables
Physical activity  is  an important part  of losing weight. It burns calories and also may  improve your mood .
Many different types and ways to  exercise  exist. Explore different options to find one you enjoy.
Consider where you want to exercise. Do you prefer the indoors or outdoors? The gym or at-home workouts? Do you prefer to exercise alone or in a group?
Group classes  help many people stay motivated. However, if you don’t enjoy group classes, working out on your own is just as good.
Listen to music while you work out, as doing so can increase motivation. People also tend to exercise longer when  listening to music .
Having a role model may help you stay  motivated to lose weight . However, it’s important to pick the right kind of role model.
Maybe you know a friend who has lost a lot of weight and can be your inspiration. You can also look for inspirational blogs or stories about people who have successfully lost weight.

While you’re losing weight
Many people  trying to lose weight  only set outcome goals, or goals they want to accomplish at the end. Typically, an outcome goal will be your final target weight.
However, focusing only on outcome goals can derail your motivation. These types of goals can often feel too distant and may leave you feeling overwhelmed.
Instead, set process goals, or actions you’ll take to reach your desired outcome. An example of a process goal is exercising four times a week or eating a vegetable with each meal.
Self-monitoring is important for weight loss motivation and success.
Research  has found that people who track their food intake are more likely to lose weight and maintain their weight loss than those who seldomly or infrequently self-monitor.
To keep a  food journal  correctly, you must write down everything you eat.
You can also record your emotions in your food journal. This can help you identify certain  triggers for overeating  and help you find healthier ways to cope.
You can keep food journals on pen and paper or use a  website or app . They have  all been found to be effective .
Losing weight is hard, so give yourself some credit when you accomplish a goal. Rewarding yourself may have the extra benefit of  improving your motivation , too.
Celebrate behavior changes  rather than just reaching a certain number on the scale.
Pick appropriate rewards, but try to avoid rewarding yourself with food. Avoid rewards that are so expensive you would never buy them anyway, or so insignificant that you wouldn’t normally be interested in them.
Tell your close family and friends about your weight loss goals so they can help support you on your journey.
Many people also find it helpful to have a weight-loss buddy or recruit friends. You can work out together,  hold each other accountable , and encourage each other throughout the process.
It can be helpful to  involve a partner , if you have one who is willing.
People who use “change talk” or motivational interviewing are more likely to  follow through with plans .
Change talk involves making statements about your commitment to behavioral changes, the reasons behind them, and the steps you’ll take or are taking to reach your goals.
Start talking positively about your weight loss. You can talk about the steps you’re going to take out loud.
Everyday stressors will pop up. Finding ways to plan for them and developing coping skills will help you stay motivated no matter what life throws your way.
Try to mentally contrast by spending a few minutes imagining that you’ve reached your goal weight and then spend another few minutes imagining any possible obstacles that may get in the way.
As seen in this  study , mentally contrasting is motivating for goal attaining and leads to action. This will keep you from getting off track and losing motivation.
Stress management  and techniques to reduce stress can help people who overeat in response.
Consider using some of these methods to cope with  stress :
exercise
practice square breathing
take a bath
get some fresh air
call a friend
ask for help
Also plan for holidays, social events, and eating out. You can research restaurant menus in advance. At parties, you can bring a healthy dish or eat smaller portions.
You don’t have to be perfect to lose weight.
If you have an “ all or nothing ” approach, you’re less likely to achieve your goals. And avoid beating yourself up when you make a mistake. Self-defeating thoughts will just hinder your motivation.
Instead,  forgive yourself . One mistake isn’t going to ruin your progress.
Research  has repeatedly found that women who dislike their bodies are more likely to try unhealthy weight loss methods compared to those with less body dissatisfaction.
Taking steps to improve your body image can help you lose more weight in a holistic way and maintain your weight loss.
The following activities can help boost your body image:
appreciate what your body can do
surround yourself with positive people
try to not compare yourself to others
wear clothes that you like and that fit you well
say the things you like about yourself out loud in the mirror

Other tips
Dogs can be the perfect weight loss companions.  Studies  show that having a dog can help you lose weight.
A  2020 study  found that people who lived with a dog for 1 month walked an average of 2,589 additional steps per day and increased their standing time per day compared to people who did not have a dog.
As an added bonus, pet ownership has been shown to improve overall health and well-being. It has been  linked  to:
decreased stress and  cortisol  levels
increased  oxytocin  levels
reduced risk of  heart disease ,  stroke , and all-cause mortality
direct social support
Talk with your doctor about adopting a dog if you have pet  allergies . Dog ownership isn’t for everyone, but you can offer to walk a friend or family member’s dog instead.
Don’t hesitate to consult professional help to aid your weight loss efforts when needed. People who feel more confident in their knowledge and ability tend to lose more weight.
This may mean finding a registered dietitian who can teach you about certain foods or an exercise physiologist to teach you how to exercise properly.
Many people also enjoy the accountability that seeing a professional provides them.
If you’re still struggling to get motivated, consider finding a psychologist or dietitian who’s trained in motivational interviewing. This approach has been  shown to help  people achieve their goals.

The takeaway
Being motivated to lose weight is important for long-term weight loss success.
People find different factors motivating, so it’s important to find out what helps motivate you. You can try a weight loss journal, positive thinking, or find a role model to provide motivation.
Give yourself flexibility, be forgiving, and celebrate the little successes along your weight loss journey. And don’t be afraid to ask for help when needed.
With the proper tools and support, you can find and stay motivated to reach your weight loss goals.
