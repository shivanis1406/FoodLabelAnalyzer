In a Healthline survey of 1,142 adults, we found that 43% of respondents were currently taking or were interested in taking a multivitamin. But with so many options, how do you know which product to choose?
Multivitamins are designed to bridge nutrient gaps in your diet, and because nutrient needs vary by stage of life, activity level, and typical diet, there’s no one best product for everyone.
That’s why our editors, dietitians, and Medical Standards and Insights team took the time to vet:
Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the products on this page, we considered all the multivitamins that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further.
Below are our picks of the best multivitamins for women of all types, along with tips from a dietitian on what to look for.
Sex and gender exist on spectrums. This article uses the term “women” to refer to a person’s sex assigned at birth.

Perelel’s Women’s Daily Trio is our pick for women looking to strengthen their  hair, skin, and nails .
In addition to a multivitamin, each daily pack contains a beauty blend capsule, which includes  biotin  and  hydrolyzed collagen  peptides.
Collagen is the most abundant protein in your body and plays a key role in maintaining the health of your skin, muscles, and bones. While more research is needed, collagen supplements have been linked with benefits for  skin health  (including reducing wrinkles) and for  strengthening hair and nails .
To round out your wellness routine, the pack also features an omega-3 softgel with  DHA and EPA  to support brain and heart health.
Perelel’s supplements are third-party tested for purity and potency, though the name of the testing organization isn’t disclosed.
While a subscription isn’t required, you can save 15% if you opt for recurring monthly shipments.

Healthline contributor and registered dietitian Kelli McGrane was familiar with Perelel after taking the company’s trimester-specific prentatal vitamins during her second pregnancy.
According to McGrane, “I’m not a big fish eater, so I typically take a  fish oil supplement  from Nordic Naturals. I’ve also been struggling with my nails breaking easily ever since I stopped taking prenatal vitamins.
“So, when I saw that Perelel’s Women’s Daily Trio combines a general women’s multivitamin with an omega-3 supplement and a beauty blend, I was curious to see if it might be a more convenient (and possibly more affordable) alternative to my current supplement regimen.”
While two of the three pills are on the larger size, McGrane reported that she didn’t have any difficulty swallowing them.
That said, she did have one helpful tip: “Because the capsules have a slightly unpleasant taste that’s only noticeable if you let them sit on your tongue for more than a few seconds, I recommend having your water glass ready to go before popping the pills in your mouth.”
At the time of her review, McGrane had only been taking the daily pack for a little over a week. However, she mentioned that she’s already noticed that her nails feel stronger and aren’t breaking as easily.

Best for women in their 20s and 30s
Form   capsule
Dose   2 capsules per day
Certifications   USP verified, non-GMO verified, Made Traceable
Price   $$
This subscription-based multivitamin provides nutrients that many women in their 20s and 30s often don’t get enough of, including:
vitamin D
folate
omega-3 fatty acid  docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
Omega-3 DHA  is associated with eye, heart, and brain health. While it’s typically found in fish, Ritual sources it from  microalgae , which means it’s vegan-friendly.
A  2021 clinical study  showed improvements in vitamin D and DHA levels in 94 healthy women ages 21 to 40 who took this product for 12 weeks. However, several of the authors were employed by Ritual, and Ritual helped fund the study.
Keep in mind that this product is geared toward women who already eat a mostly healthy diet and need help filling a few nutrient gaps.
Notably, the product is missing vitamin C, B vitamins, selenium, and calcium.

Registered dietitian Kelli McGrane said that she was “overall impressed with Ritual Essential for Women Multivitamin 18+. I found the pills easy to swallow and appreciated the company’s transparency around ingredient sourcing.
“As someone who doesn’t eat fish often, I also liked that the multivitamin included omega-3 DHA. While some online reviewers complain about fishy burps, I found that the minty-fresh flavor masked any fishiness.”

This  multivitamin for women over 50  is our dietitian’s pick as the best multivitamin during and after menopause.
In addition to being manufactured by Thorne, a supplement brand that’s well known for its commitment to quality, we like that the product is specifically designed to address changing nutrient needs that occur during this stage of life.
For example, after menopause,  women need  less iron but more calcium and vitamin B6. Vitamins D and B12 are also of particular importance.
The multivitamin also includes  lutein , an antioxidant that plays a role in  maintaining eye health .
Thorne Research manufactures its products in third-party certified facilities and has received an A rating from the Therapeutic Goods Administration.
Learn more about the brand in  our  expert review of Thorne .
Healthline director of commerce Rita Mauceri shared, “I liked everything about Thorne Women’s Multi 50+ except having to take 6 capsules a day. As someone who doesn’t love taking pills, the capsules themselves weren’t off-putting, but the having to down that many was.
“As I hit 50+, the things that have become more important for me are bone and brain health, along with hormone support and eye health. This product provides a pretty full-spectrum array of essential nutrients for  healthy aging , and at optimal doses.
“In particular, I appreciated the 25 mcg [micrograms] of vitamin D, since my bone density is slightly low, along with the hefty dose of B12 (450 mcg), biotin (400 mcg), and chromium (200 mcg) to support healthy blood sugar levels.
“I felt good in the 30 days that I took these multivitamins. My energy, mood, and focus felt strong and even. My sleep and digestion were also better than normal.”

Nature Made Multi for Her is our pick as the best option for women on a budget.
Despite being less expensive than many others on the market, it still contains 23 nutrients important for women’s health and is third-party tested and verified by  United States Pharmacopeia (USP) .
Notably, it contains 100% of the DV for iron in the highly absorbable form  ferrous fumarate , making this a great option for women who are menstruating.
Still, keep in mind that while ferrous fumarate is well absorbed by the body, it’s more likely to cause gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, such as constipation, than another form of iron called iron bisglycinate.
Healthline editor Kelle Walsh shared that she regularly takes women’s multivitamins and was curious to try this product because of its lower price point.
After taking it for 2 weeks, Walsh noted, “I only take one-a-day multis, so this experience was the same. The [Nature Made] pill was slightly smaller.”
She also shared that the tablet was easy to take, didn’t have an unpleasant taste or aftertaste, and didn’t cause any unwanted side effects.
When asked about her overall thoughts about the value of the product, Walsh answered, “It’s definitely a good value. It costs half as much as my usual multivitamin.”
That said, Walsh also highlighted the fact that some nutrients are present in amounts lower than 100% of the DV, which may be a dealbreaker for some (though, it could be a pro for others). In particular, she was disappointed to see that it only provides 19% of the DV for calcium.

If you have a hard time getting enough  iron in your diet , you may want to consider this multivitamin from mindbodygreen. Each 2-capsule serving contains 9 milligrams (mg) of iron, which is 50% of the Daily Value (DV) for premenopausal women.
What’s more, the form of iron used is thought to be  easier on the stomach  and potentially more effective for improving hemoglobin levels, though more research is needed.
Providing 27 key vitamins and minerals, mindbodygreen’s ultimate multivitamin+ is also one of the most comprehensive multivitamins on our list.
Mindbodygreen supplements undergo rigorous testing throughout the manufacturing process at International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certified third-party labs to ensure purity and potency.
The company’s ultimate multivitamin+ is also vegan-friendly, gluten-free, and soy-free, making it suitable for people with certain dietary restrictions.
The biggest downside of this multivitamin is the price. However, you can save $11 per bottle when you sign up for a monthly subscription.

Healthline editorial director Megan Severs tested the multivitamin for 1 month.
According to Severs, “My first impression was that the container was the nicest-looking pill bottle I’ve ever seen. Remembering to take my daily multivitamin is often a challenge for me, but because of the … packaging, I felt OK leaving them out on the counter, which helped me remember to take them.
“A single serving size is two pills. I’m not usually a fan of multivitamins that require multiple pills, but in this case, I was OK with it. Each pill was easy to swallow, and they didn’t have a noticeable taste or aftertaste.
“The pills were gentle on the stomach. I don’t always eat breakfast, and even when I took them without food, I did not experience any nausea, which is not the case with other multivitamins I have taken. In fact, I had no noticeable side effects.
“My only complaint is the cost. They are about twice as expensive as the multivitamins I usually take, but I was happy enough with the experience and lack of side effects that I’d consider switching to these, despite the increased expense.”

Thanks to its high quality ingredients, comprehensive formulation, and third-party testing, this organic women’s multivitamin is our pick as the best overall multivitamin for women.

Plus, the product is certified vegan, making it suitable for omnivores and vegans alike. It’s also certified gluten-free.
According to the company, all Garden of Life products are third-party tested for purity and potency. Additionally, products are tested in house to make sure they’re free of heavy metals, microbial growth, and pathogenic species.
Healthline contributor and registered dietitian Kelli McGrane shared her thoughts after taking this multivitamin for 1 month.
“I was overall impressed with this multivitamin. The bottle (which was purchased online) arrived in good condition — none of the capsules were broken. While I don’t mind swallowing pills, I was relieved that the dose is just one tablet per day.
“The tablets themselves are on the larger side and have a pleasant, herby-fruity smell, which I can only compare to the smell of a natural vitamin store, like Vitamin Cottage. Because the pills are tablets, not softgels, they don’t go down quite as easily. However, I didn’t have any issues with feeling like the pill was getting stuck in my throat.
“As for the formulation itself, I liked that it provides 1,000 IU of vitamin D, as well as all eight B vitamins. I also appreciated that it only contains a small amount of iron, which I’ve found can be  constipating  and hard on my stomach in larger amounts.
“I eat a generally healthy diet, so I didn’t expect to notice changes to my mood or general well-being. However, after just a few weeks, my nails felt stronger and didn’t break as frequently as they typically do.”

Best prenatal
Form   capsule
Dose   8 capsules per day
Certifications   third-party tested for purity and potency, non-GMO
Price   $$$
Developed by a registered dietitian and fertility nutrition expert, this  prenatal vitamin  is formulated to provide the  nutrients needed  to support a healthy pregnancy.
In addition to nutrients such as folate and calcium, the supplement includes  choline , an essential nutrient that’s important for  fetal development  and proper functioning of the placenta.
According to the company’s website, FullWell did not include omega-3 DHA because of concerns that DHA may not be as effective when combined with a multivitamin. However, FullWell does offer a separate fish oil supplement that can cover your daily needs for both DHA and EPA.
Adequate amounts of DHA are important  during pregnancy , so it’s a good idea to discuss taking a DHA supplement with your doctor.
It’s worth noting that the required serving size of eight pills per day could be difficult for some people to tolerate. To improve tolerability, the company states that users can open the pills and stir the contents into a food or beverage of their choice.
FullWell Prenatal Multivitamins are third-party tested, although the name of the testing organization is not disclosed.
Healthline editor Catherine Conelly first tried FullWell’s prenatal after giving birth to her first child and is currently taking them again during her second pregnancy.
According to Conelly, “I subscribed to [FullWell’s] prenatal and fish oil bundle while breastfeeding. At first, I was worried about the fact that you had to take eight capsules per day for the prenatal because vitamins have given me a stomachache in the past. So far, it has not caused me any discomfort, so I’m super relieved.
“Of course, every new mom is going to feel tired to some extent, and I don’t think a prenatal can totally solve that. However, I don’t feel excessively wiped out so far, and I like to think that taking the right vitamins and getting enough nutrients has helped.”

Healthline team member Heather Reisebeck took these gummies every day for 3 weeks.
Per Reisebeck, the vitamins arrived in good condition and were easy to take: “The flavor listed on the bottle is Blissful Berry, which I think is fitting. I thought they tasted awesome and left no aftertaste. The texture was also pleasant, plus easy to chew & swallow.”
When comparing them to other women’s multivitamins she’s tried, Reisbeck shared, “I think that these are very similar to other gummy vitamins I’ve tried, but that they have a slightly better taste.
“Compared to multivitamin capsules, I found these a lot more convenient to take since you didn’t need to have a drink on hand and could just pop them in and eat them.”

Vegan diets have been associated with numerous  health benefits , from a reduced risk of chronic diseases to improved overall  diet quality .
However, because some nutrients are primarily found in animal products, vegan diets have also been linked to an increased risk for certain nutrient deficiencies, most notably vitamin B12.
Future Kind Essential Vegan Multivitamin is a third-party tested multivitamin that contains three  nutrients that are often lacking  in an otherwise well-rounded vegan diet, including:
vitamin B12
omega-3 DHA and EPA
vitamin D
In addition to its targeted formulation, we like that the multivitamin is vegan and cruelty-free, packaged in an eco-friendly glass bottle, and third-party tested with testing results readily available online.
For women needing a more comprehensive formulation, Future Kind also sells a Vegan Complete Multivitamin.
Healthline team member Sydney Samuels has been following a vegetarian lifestyle for the past 16 years.
After being diagnosed with a vitamin B12 deficiency and low levels of vitamin D, she started taking supplements for both nutrients (after being first given a B12 injection) and started to notice significant improvements in her energy levels after just a few weeks.
She was excited to try Future Kind Essential Vegan Multi for the convenience of having both nutrients in one supplement.
According to Samuels, “The Future Kind Essential Vegan Multivitamin arrived well packaged. The vitamins are packed in a glass jar that has two security seals. I received it in a cardboard box with some packing paper to keep the glass jar safe.
“[The] capsules are medium in size, about 3/4 of an inch long. Despite their size, they have a smooth coating, so they were relatively easy for me to swallow. The taste is subtle, but it’s slightly sweet with a hint of citrus.
“I appreciate that this product is formulated for vegans, not only supplying nutrients often missed in plant-based diets, but also that the ingredients are vegan, too.
“I’ve made the mistake before of purchasing a supplement, only to realize once I already have it that it’s not vegetarian (usually due to gelatin in the gummy or softgel capsule). This one checked all the boxes for me!”
At the time of her review, Samuels had been taking the multivitamin for a little over a week and noted that she plans to continue taking it long term.

Mela Daily Essentials is a high quality multivitamin that was created by and for women of color.
In particular, the supplement focuses on vitamin D, an essential nutrient that people of color are  more likely  to be deficient in. This is in part due to melanin in the skin making it harder for the body to synthesize adequate amounts of vitamin D.
Vitamin D  is not only important for bone health and regulating your mood, but having chronically low levels of vitamin D may also increase the risk of certain diseases, including  breast cancer .
Because of these concerns, Mela Daily Essentials provides 300% of the DV for vitamin D in the form of vitamin D3 for optimal absorption.
In addition to 10 essential vitamins and minerals, the supplement includes  adaptogens  and a probiotic blend.
We also love that the company’s products are non-GMO, gluten-free, certified vegan, and third-party tested for purity and potency.
Healthline editor Kristin Currin-Sheehan tested Mela Daily Essentials for 2 weeks. According to Currin-Sheehan, she typically takes a multivitamin from MegaFood, but was curious to see if Mela Daily Essentials offered any additional benefits, particularly for her hair, skin, and nails. She also shared that she has low levels of vitamin D.
“I typically judge a multivitamin’s absorption in my body by two factors: how well my fatigue is alleviated and if my nails grow.”
While she noted that she didn’t experience the same boost of energy that she’s noticed when taking other multivitamins, she did notice improvements to her skin and nails. “I’m happy to report that after 2 weeks, my short,  brittle nails  grew strong (usually I can bend them like paper) and at least 1 to 2 cm!”
Currin-Sheehan also commented that the pills were easy to take and that the multivitamin came with a helpful handout about the product.

How we chose the best multivitamins for women
We rounded up the best multivitamins for women based on the following criteria that we believe to be important indicators of safety, quality, and transparency:
Nutrient quality:  We looked for products that use highly absorbable forms of nutrients.
Ingredients:  We included products made from quality ingredients and free of artificial additives. We also paid close attention to the types and amounts of nutrients included in each product.
Health concerns:  We looked for products to suit a variety of needs.
Quality testing:  We prioritized products tested for purity and potency, ideally by a third-party lab.
Brand reputation:  Every product on our list is produced by a medically credible company. We also ensured that every brand is compliant with labeling requirements per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Vetting:  All the multivitamins on our list have been vetted to ensure they align with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being. You can read more about  our vetting process .

A comparison of the best multivitamins for women
Here’s a quick look at how our top picks compare:
*Third-party testing refers to whether the product is tested for purity and potency by a third-party lab.

Who might benefit from a women’s multivitamin?
While this list isn’t exhaustive, people who may benefit from a multivitamin include those who:
are  pregnant , breastfeeding, or trying to conceive
follow a  vegan diet
have food allergies
follow a more restrictive diet
have little appetite
have a diagnosis of absorption issues
are  over 55 years old
have a diagnosed nutrient deficiency or are at risk of developing a nutrient deficiency
Not everyone needs a multivitamin, as some people get plenty of nutrients through diet alone. Additionally, multivitamins may not be appropriate for people who are already taking other single-nutrient supplements or who take certain medications.
Before purchasing a multivitamin, it’s best to talk with a healthcare professional about whether a multivitamin is necessary or appropriate.

How to choose a multivitamin for women
With so many multivitamins available, choosing a product can feel overwhelming. Here are a few factors to consider:
Age and life stage:  Because nutrient needs change as you age, some multivitamins are made specifically for certain age groups. Similarly, people who are pregnant or  nursing  should opt for a product specifically formulated to meet prenatal or postnatal needs.
Dietary restrictions or allergies:  Be sure to carefully read ingredient labels if you have a food allergy or dietary restriction.
Amounts of nutrients provided:  It’s typically best to avoid products that contain very high doses of any nutrients unless a healthcare professional has recommended them to you.
Number of pills:  If you have difficulty remembering to take your vitamins, opt for a product that’s taken once per day. Additionally, if you don’t like swallowing pills, consider a gummy, chewable, or drink powder option instead.
Budget:  Be sure to consider the price per serving when determining whether a supplement fits your budget.
Quality:  Choose products that are third-party tested by organizations such as USP,  NSF International , and  ConsumerLab .
Before beginning any new supplement, we recommend talking with a healthcare professional. Not everyone needs to take multivitamins, and your doctor may recommend a single-nutrient vitamin instead.
There are many essential nutrients. However, some are particularly important to look for in a multivitamin, either because the nutrients play a  key role in women’s health  specifically, or because women are more likely to consume  inadequate amounts  of them in their diets.
These nutrients include:
vitamin D
vitamin E
all eight B vitamins , especially vitamin B6 and folate
calcium
choline
iron
magnesium
Still, keep in mind that depending on your diet, you may not need a supplement that contains all the nutrients listed above. Additionally,  nutrient needs and amounts vary  depending on your stage of life, among other factors.

Some vitamins, such as water-soluble vitamins, can be absorbed on an empty stomach. However, multivitamins also typically contain fat-soluble vitamins, which require dietary fat for absorption, so it’s best to take them with a meal or snack.
To make it easier to remember to take your multivitamin, try taking your vitamin with the same meal each day.

The bottom line
Multivitamins can help fill nutritional gaps for people who have difficulty meeting their nutrient needs through diet alone, as well as for people who are pregnant or nursing or have certain dietary restrictions.
But not everyone needs a multivitamin, and regularly consuming some nutrients in excess can be detrimental to overall health. Also, keep in mind that multivitamins have the potential to interact with other supplements or prescription medications.
Be sure to check with a healthcare professional before beginning any new supplements, including a multivitamin.
