In general, pre-workout supplements provide specific compounds and nutrients that serve to enhance your workout results.
These range from stimulants for improved energy levels to other agents that improve blood flow to working muscles, which are also referred to as pump products.

How pump products work
Pump products use a combination of ingredients that  increase nitric oxide production  in the body, which can dilate blood vessels and increase blood flow to working muscles.
In theory, this can translate to increased exercise performance.
The top three ingredients found in pump-focused pre-workouts, as well their researched doses, are as follows ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ):
While some research on the efficacy of these ingredients exists, more research is required to determine the long-term effects of pump products on sports performance.

A note on third-party testing
Some supplement companies choose to have their products tested by an outside laboratory to ensure that they’re void of contaminants and banned substances.
This is referred to as third-party testing.
It’s best practice to purchase supplements that have been third-party tested, as these laboratories provide an unbiased assessment, helping you avoid exposure to potentially harmful or banned substances, especially if you’re a drug-tested athlete.
These third-party testing labs also ensure that the labeling aligns with the actual product.
While Healthline tries to only recommend third-party-tested products, there aren’t many on the market for pre-workout supplements.
If third-party testing is unavailable for a product you’re interested in, research the company to see whether it provides other measures of quality assurance.

How to choose the best pre-workout supplement for pump
With endless pre-workouts on the market, it can be a daunting task to choose the one that’s best for you.
First, decide if you prefer a pre-workout with or without caffeine, as some brands make two versions.
Next, determine whether the ingredients are present in the proper ratios by referring to the chart above.
Lastly, check the label to see whether the product is third-party tested, which ensures that it’s free of contaminants and banned substances.
Another indicator of quality is whether the product is manufactured in a cGMP-approved facility, which means that it follows standards established by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Two other potential factors you may consider are cost per serving and available flavors, though this depends on your budget and taste preferences.

How do these pre-workout supplements compare?

Should you use a pre-workout supplement for pump?
While pre-workouts are generally safe for most people, some populations should exhibit caution to avoid potential adverse effects.
Pre-workouts commonly carry a warning label stating that the product should only be consumed by healthy individuals 18 years old and older.
This is mainly due to their high caffeine content, though caffeine-free options are available.
Some populations for which they may not be suitable include children under the age of 18, those with heart conditions, people who are sensitive to caffeine, and those who are pregnant or nursing.
Keep in mind that there’s little information on the long-term effects of using pump products. They’re meant to be used short term.
Also, always consult your healthcare provider before beginning a new supplement routine.

Frequently asked questions
Pre-workout  supplements may help you get a little more out of your workouts, but they are most effective when combined with good  nutrition ,  sleep , and  exercise  habits.
Before even considering taking a pre-workout, make sure other important aspects of your health are optimized. Even then, pre-workouts will most likely only have a minimal impact on your results.
Traditionally, pre-workouts are designed to be taken on workout days to enhance adaptations from training. Therefore, it’s recommended you only consume them on days when you’ll be working out.
If you train most days of the week, you may only want to take a pre-workout before your most intense training sessions for an added energy boost.
If your pre-workout contains caffeine and you take it but don’t work out afterward, you may feel quite restless or jittery.
Many pre-workouts contain around 200 mg of  caffeine , which is about the same as what you’d get from drinking two cups of strong  coffee .
While there would likely be no acute health effects, taking pre-workout without working out would be considered “off-label” use. Most manufacturers and experts do not recommend doing this.

The bottom line
Pump-focused  pre-workout supplements  contain a blend of ingredients meant to stimulate increased blood and oxygen flow to working muscles during exercise.
The main ingredients to look for include L-citrulline, arginine, and betaine in research-backed doses of 6–8 grams, 3–6 grams, and 2.5 grams, respectively.
When choosing a pre-workout, it’s best to find one that’s third-party tested, as this ensures the product is void of contaminants and banned substances.
Lastly, it’s important to exhibit caution when taking pre-workouts, as some populations may experience adverse reactions, such as children under 18 and those with heart conditions.
