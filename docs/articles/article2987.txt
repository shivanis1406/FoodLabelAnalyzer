Title: Should Kids Take Omega-3 Supplements?

Omega-3 fatty acids are a crucial component of a healthy diet.
These essential fats are especially important for children, as they play a key role in growth and development and are associated with numerous health benefits ( 1 ).
However, many parents are unsure whether omega-3 supplements are necessary — or even safe — for their children.
This article takes an in-depth look at the benefits, side effects, and dosage recommendations of omega-3 supplements to determine whether kids should take them.

What are omega-3s?
Omega-3s are fatty acids that are integral to many aspects of health, including fetal development, brain function, heart health, and immunity ( 2 ).
They’re considered  essential fatty acids  because your body cannot produce them on its own and needs to obtain them from food.
The three main types are alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
ALA is present in a variety of plant foods, including vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, and certain vegetables. Yet, it isn’t active in your body, and your body only converts it into active forms, such as DHA and EPA, in very small amounts ( 3 ,  4 ).
Meanwhile, EPA and DHA occur naturally in fatty fish, such as  salmon , mackerel, and tuna, and are widely available in supplements ( 3 ).
While many types of omega-3 supplements exist, some of the most common are fish oil, krill oil, and algae oil.
Omega-3 fats are essential fatty acids that play a central role in several aspects of your health. ALA, EPA, and DHA are the three main types available in foods and supplements.

Omega-3 benefits for kids
Many studies suggest that omega-3 supplements offer several benefits for children.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition linked to symptoms like hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and difficulty focusing ( 5 ).
Some research indicates that omega-3 supplements may help decrease ADHD symptoms in children.
A review of 16 studies revealed that omega-3 fatty acids improved  memory , attention, learning, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, all of which are often affected by ADHD ( 6 ).
A 16-week study in 79 boys showed that taking 1,300 mg of omega-3s daily improved attention in those with and without ADHD ( 7 ).
What’s more, a large review of 52 studies concluded that  dietary modifications  and fish oil supplements were two of the most promising techniques to reduce ADHD symptoms in children ( 8 ).
Asthma is a chronic condition that affects children and adults, causing symptoms like chest pain, breathing difficulties, coughing, and wheezing ( 9 ).
Some studies have found that omega-3 fatty acid supplements help relieve these symptoms.
For instance, a 10-month study in 29 children noted that taking a  fish-oil capsule  containing 120 mg of combined DHA and EPA daily helped decrease symptoms of asthma ( 10 ).
Another study in 135 children associated a higher intake of omega-3 fatty acids with a reduction in asthma symptoms caused by indoor air pollution ( 11 ).
Other studies reveal a possible link between omega-3 fatty acids and a lower risk of asthma in children ( 12 ,  13 ).
Sleep disturbances affect nearly 4% of children under age 18 ( 14 ).
One study in 395 children tied lower blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids to a higher risk of sleep problems. It also found that supplementing with 600 mg of DHA over 16 weeks decreased  sleep interruptions  and led to nearly 1 more hour of sleep per night ( 15 ).
Other research suggests that consuming more omega-3 fatty acids during  pregnancy  could improve sleep patterns in infants ( 16 ,  17 ).
However, more high-quality studies regarding omega-3s and sleep in children are needed.
Emerging research indicates that omega-3 fatty acids may  improve brain function  and mood in children — in particular, learning, memory, and brain development ( 18 ).
In a 6-month study, 183 children who ate a spread high in omega-3 fatty acids experienced improved verbal learning ability and memory ( 19 ).
Similarly, a small, 8-week study in 33 boys linked 400–1,200 mg of  DHA  daily to increased activation of the prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain responsible for attention, impulse control, and planning ( 20 ).
Furthermore, several studies suggest that omega-3 fats help prevent depression and mood disorders in children ( 21 ,  22 ,  23 ).
Research has found that omega-3 fatty acids may enhance brain health, promote better sleep, and improve ADHD and asthma symptoms.

Potential side effects
The side effects of omega-3 supplements, such as fish oil, are generally very mild. The most common ones include ( 24 ):
bad breath
unpleasant aftertaste
headache
heartburn
stomach upset
nausea
diarrhea
Make sure your kid sticks to the recommended dosage to reduce their risk of side effects. You can also start them on a lower dose, increasing gradually to assess tolerance.
Those who are allergic to fish or shellfish should avoid fish oil and other fish-based supplements, such as  cod liver oil  and krill oil.
Instead, opt for other foods or supplements rich in omega-3s like flaxseed or algal oil.
Omega-3 supplements are linked to mild side effects like bad breath, headaches, and digestive issues. Stick to the recommended dosage and avoid fish-based supplements in cases of fish or shellfish allergies.

Dosage for children
Daily needs for omega-3s depend on age and gender. If you’re using supplements, it’s best to follow the instructions on the package.
Notably, ALA is the only omega-3 fatty acid with specific dosage guidelines. The recommended daily intakes for ALA in children are ( 3 ):
0–12 months:  0.5 grams
1–3 years:  0.7 grams
4–8 years:  0.9 grams
Girls 9–13 years:  1.0 grams
Boys 9–13 years:  1.2 grams
Girls 14–18 years:  1.1 grams
Boys 14–18 years:  1.6 grams
Fatty fish, nuts, seeds, and plant oils are all excellent sources of omega-3s that you can easily add to your child’s diet to boost their intake.
Consider supplements if your child doesn’t regularly eat fish or other  foods high in omega-3 fatty acids .
In general, most studies indicate that 120–1,300 mg of combined DHA and EPA per day is beneficial for children ( 25 ,  26 ).
Still, to prevent any adverse effects, it’s best to consult a trusted healthcare professional before starting your child on supplements.
Your child’s omega-3 needs vary by age and gender. Including omega-3-rich foods in their diet can ensure children are meeting their requirements. Before giving them supplements, talk to a medical practitioner.

The bottom line
Omega-3 fatty acids are important for maintaining your child’s overall health.
Omega-3s are especially beneficial for kids’ brain health. They may also aid sleep quality and reduce symptoms of ADHD and asthma.
Providing plenty of foods high in omega-3s can help ensure that your child is meeting their daily needs. If you opt for  supplements , it’s best to consult a healthcare professional to ensure proper dosage.
