Title: What Is Heart of Palm, and How Is It Eaten?

Heart of palm is a white vegetable obtained from the center of specific varieties of palm trees. It’s prized for its culinary versatility, and it packs several beneficial minerals and antioxidants.
When harvested, young trees are felled and debarked to expose their edible, white inner core, which is then cut into lengths for further processing.
While most commonly added to salads, heart of palm can also be eaten on its own or used as a vegan meat replacement. It has a slight crunch similar to that of white asparagus, though its flavor is comparable to artichoke hearts.

Potential benefits
Due to its nutrient content, heart of palm may offer several health benefits.
Heart of palm is rich in plant compounds like  polyphenol  antioxidants.
These compounds neutralize free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can trigger oxidative damage when levels become too high in your body. Oxidative damage is linked to numerous diseases ( 2 ).
In turn, antioxidants may reduce your risk of certain conditions, such as  cancer , diabetes, and heart disease ( 2 ,  3 ).
Diets high in polyphenols are also associated with reduced inflammation, which is thought to be a key factor in many of these ailments ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ).
Heart of palm is a plentiful source of several minerals, including potassium, copper, phosphorus, and zinc.
Potassium serves as an  electrolyte  and helps regulate blood pressure. Increased intake is linked to lower blood pressure in healthy individuals ( 7 ).
Alongside iron, copper aids in the formation of red blood cells. In addition, it helps maintain nerve cells and immune function. As low copper levels are associated with high cholesterol and blood pressure, proper intake may help prevent these conditions ( 8 ,  9 ).
Meanwhile,  phosphorus  promotes strong bones and teeth. Your body also uses it to make proteins that grow and repair cells and tissues ( 10 ).
Finally, zinc aids immune function, cell division, and wound healing ( 11 ).
Heart of palm may promote weight loss, as it contains minimal amounts of fat and only 36 calories and 4 grams of carbs per 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving.
As weight loss requires  eating fewer calories than you burn  on a daily basis, replacing high calorie items with this veggie may aid your efforts ( 12 ,  13 ).
Due to its high water and fiber content, heart of palm may also promote  feelings of fullness  — which can naturally lead you to eat less ( 1 ,  14 ,  15 ).
For example, chopping heart of palm into salads or stir-fries can bulk up your dish without adding excessive calories.
Due to its high antioxidant and mineral contents, as well as its low calorie count, heart of palm may help prevent various diseases and promote weight loss.

How is heart of palm eaten?

It can also be eaten on its own or grilled and seasoned to make a unique appetizer.
Vegetarians and vegans often use heart of palm as a  meat or seafood substitute , as it provides a similar texture, though it should be noted that it’s not a good source of protein.
Still, it makes excellent vegan carnitas, calamari, lobster rolls, and fish sticks.
Considering its low carb content, heart of palm can be safely included on  the keto diet .
This low carb, high fat diet may promote weight loss by encouraging your body to burn fat instead of carbs for energy.
A typical 2-ounce (60-gram) serving of this vegetable provides around 2 grams of carbs. As the keto diet generally restricts carb intake to 50 grams per day, an average helping of heart of palm would only comprise 4% of your daily carb allowance ( 16 ).
