Title: The 8 Best BCAA Supplements: A Dietitian’s Picks

Thorne Amino Complex is our top pick for overall branch-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation. See which other vetted brands round out our list and why.
Branched-chain amino acids, more commonly known as BCAAs, include the essential amino acids:
leucine
isoleucine
valine
BCAAs differ from other amino acids because they have a  branched structure  and are the only amino acids broken down in skeletal muscle. They’re considered essential because you must consume them through your diet.
Athletes and gym-goers commonly  take BCAA supplements  to:
enhance performance
reduce soreness
prevent muscle fatigue
While more research is needed, some studies suggest that BCAA supplements may be beneficial for:
people who don’t consume enough protein in their diet
older adults
those with certain  liver diseases , like cirrhosis, which is characterized by liver scarring
While BCAAs aren’t necessary for everyone, they might be helpful for certain people, including athletes. If you’re interested in trying a BCAA supplement, we rounded up the eight best.

How to choose the best BCAA supplement
If you’re interested in taking a BCAA supplement, there are a few things to consider while you’re shopping for a product.
Quality:  When shopping for a BCAA supplement, you can buy supplements only from trusted brands that adhere to safety and quality standards, such as third-party testing and those that follow CGMPs established by the FDA.
Dose:  Dosing of BCAAs depends on many factors, including what you’re taking the BCAAs for and your body weight. Most supplements contain between 3 g and 10 g of total BCAAs per serving and can be taken several times daily. If you’re unsure about proper dosage or  timing , it’s best to consult a registered dietitian who specializes in sports nutrition or a doctor if you’re taking BCAAs for a health condition.
Ingredients:  Some BCAA supplements contain added sugars, gluten, soy, and  artificial sweeteners . Be sure to read ingredient lists if you want to avoid any of these.
Form:  Consider the type of BCAA supplement that works best for you. For example, powders are a good choice if you have a hard time swallowing pills.
BCAA supplements are generally considered safe. However, it’s best to check with a healthcare professional before starting a new supplement, especially if you have a health condition.
Some people, including those with health conditions that interfere with the breakdown of BCAAs, like  maple syrup urine disease , should avoid taking BCAA supplements.
Additionally, BCAA supplements are not recommended for people who are pregnant or nursing.

Frequently asked questions about BCAAs
As with many supplements, you may be wondering about the benefits of taking BCAAs and how effective they are. Below are some answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about BCAAs.
While most studies suggest that  BCAAs  are unlikely to improve exercise performance or  muscle growth , they have been shown to  decrease muscle soreness  when taken before or after a workout.
They may also have benefits outside of exercise performance, such as for  cognitive  and  liver health  and for improving  cancer-induced   cachexia . However, these benefits are still being studied, and more solid evidence is needed.
Studies suggest that BCAAs may be beneficial for certain populations, such as athletes and people with some  liver conditions , like cirrhosis.
Keep in mind that dosing and frequency change depending on what the BCAA supplement is being used for. For example, an athlete taking a BCAA supplement to support performance and recovery may require a different daily dose than someone using a BCAA supplement to improve a liver condition.
This is why it’s always best to get advice from a healthcare professional to ensure you use BCAA supplements effectively and appropriately.
Lastly, keep in mind that BCAA supplements aren’t necessary for everyone. BCAAs are found naturally in food sources of protein, and  most people get enough  through a well balanced diet.
Generally, BCAA supplements are safe for healthy individuals to take and haven’t been shown to cause serious side effects.
However, some people shouldn’t take BCAA supplements, including people who are pregnant or nursing or people with  maple syrup urine disease , a condition in which the  body cannot break down BCAAs .
It’s always a good idea to run any new supplements by a healthcare professional before starting, especially if you’re taking medications.
For athletes, it’s usually recommended to take BCAAs shortly before or after a workout, though there’s no set time on when to take them.
Studies suggest that BCAA levels  peak around 30 minutes after ingestion  and drop to their initial level after 180 minutes.
If a healthcare professional recommends a BCAA supplement for a health condition, be sure to follow their dosing instructions.
Research suggests that  it’s safe for most people  to take BCAAs daily for extended periods.
However, for most people, taking BCAAs every day isn’t necessary. If you have questions regarding the safety of BCAA supplements and whether you should be taking them daily, you can talk with a trusted healthcare professional.
Studies show that BCAAs contain around  4.65 calories per gram . However, the calorie content isn’t always listed on supplement labels due to different regulations regarding the calorie content of whole proteins and individual amino acids.

The bottom line
BCAA supplements are popular among those looking to  boost exercise performance .
Many types are available, including capsules and flavored or unflavored powders. You may also want to consider factors, such as:
ingredient quality
testing
cost before purchasing
BCAA supplements may not be safe for all people, so be sure to talk with a healthcare professional before taking any of the products listed above.
