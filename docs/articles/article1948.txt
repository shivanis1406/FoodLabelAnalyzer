Title: The 30 Best Keto-Friendly Restaurants

If you go on the low carb, high fat keto diet, you may think you need to give up eating out. Indeed, it can be tricky to find keto-friendly options other than bunless burgers and grilled chicken salads.
Most people on this diet try to limit total daily carb intake to 50 grams or fewer, or 25 grams or fewer of net carbs (total carbs minus fiber).
Surprisingly, numerous restaurants now offer a wider range of healthy keto options.
To make it easier, we’ve assembled this list of U.S. restaurants based on the following criteria:
Nationwide availability.  Although thousands of independent restaurants likely offer keto-friendly options, we stuck with U.S.-based national or regional chains. Still, you can use the menu options in this guide to make keto-friendly choices at other restaurants, too.
Variety of keto options.  We searched for restaurants that offered a bit more variety than bunless burgers — unless, like In-N-Out, they’re known for doing bunless burgers exceptionally well.
Restaurant type.  To make this guide as useful as possible, we included several types of restaurants, including fast food, fast casual, buffets, pizza places, steakhouses, and diners.
Here are the best keto-friendly restaurants of 2022.

1–9. Fast food
