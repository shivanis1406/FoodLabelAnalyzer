Title: 6 Helpful Supplements for Eczema

Characterized by itchy, dry, and inflamed skin, living with eczema can sometimes be frustrating. There are treatment options and medications, but some supplements may also help.
Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a common condition that affects between  7.2 and 10.2%  of people in the United States, based on several prevalence studies.
Here are six supplements that may help reduce symptoms of eczema.

What supplements are good for eczema?
Fish oil helps boost your intake of heart-healthy  omega-3 fatty acids , which  may support  skin health due to their powerful anti-inflammatory properties.
There is some evidence that these fatty acids  can suppress  the activity of immune cells that trigger eczema.
While research results have been mixed,  several studies  have found a link between fish oil supplements and improved eczema symptoms.
Although more research is needed, some animal and human studies suggest that fish oil may be beneficial for treating eczema.
Your skin produces vitamin D — also known as the sunshine vitamin — when exposed to the sun. Vitamin D is also  found naturally in several foods  and is widely available as a supplement.
Some research suggests that  vitamin D  may help treat eczema.
One  review of four studies  concluded that supplementing with vitamin D was more effective at reducing the severity of eczema symptoms than placebo treatment.
Another  review of 21 studies  associated lower vitamin D levels with increased eczema severity in children. It also found that supplementing with vitamin D improved eczema symptoms in about two-thirds of the studies.
Multiple studies suggest that supplementing with vitamin D may reduce inflammation and symptoms of eczema.
Vitamin E is an essential micronutrient in various  skin care  products.
In addition to its ability to protect the skin against oxidative stress, some  studies  have found that it may help decrease symptoms of eczema.
A  recent review  has also concluded that a daily dosage of up to 600 IU of vitamin E is considered safe and may benefit skin health.
Supplementing with vitamin E may help improve skin health and decrease symptoms of eczema.
Zinc  is an important mineral that  plays a key role  in skin health.
Several  studies  suggest it may help treat inflammatory skin conditions, including acne and eczema.
One  review of 16 studies  also associated low zinc levels with a higher chance of eczema ( 19 ).
Keep in mind that zinc is found in  many food sources , including meat, seafood, dairy, and legumes, and most people can meet their needs by following a healthy, well-rounded diet.
However, if you think you might have a deficiency, talk with a doctor to see whether supplementation may be beneficial.
Some studies show that supplementing with zinc may help reduce eczema severity, especially if you have a deficiency.
Although melatonin is best known as a sleep supplement, it may also help treat eczema.
Research  shows that melatonin may act as an  antioxidant , reduce levels of specific inflammation markers, and inhibit eczema development.
One study included 48 children. Taking 3 mg of melatonin daily for 4 weeks improved  sleep  quality and  reduced  eczema severity.
However, further studies are needed, especially in adults.
Melatonin may act as an antioxidant and reduce levels of inflammation. Some research suggests that it may decrease eczema severity in children, but more studies are needed.
Probiotics  are beneficial bacteria  associated with  numerous health benefits.
Although research has found mixed results, some studies suggest that probiotics may help reduce symptoms of eczema.
For instance, one study showed that infants who received probiotics were  less likely  to develop eczema than those in a control group.
On the other hand,  one review  of 39 studies concluded that probiotics didn’t significantly affect symptoms or quality of life in people with eczema.
Therefore, more research is needed to determine whether probiotics are beneficial for treating eczema.
Some studies show that probiotics may help treat and prevent eczema, but research is conflicting.

Frequently asked questions
According to a meta-analysis of 10 studies, vitamin D3 had the  most evidence  for helping reduce eczema treatment, as well as the largest sample size. Vitamin D3 is a form of vitamin D along with vitamin D2.
There is some  evidence  showing an association between normal levels of vitamin D and reduced eczema symptoms in children. However, study findings have been mixed, and more research is necessary.
It isn’t possible to cure eczema naturally, but some remedies  can help . These include:
oils such as coconut and sunflower
probiotics
colloidal oatmeal
