Title: 5 Diets That Are Supported by Science



While many diets may work for you, the key is finding one you like and can stick to in the long run.
Here are 5 healthy diets that are scientifically proven to be effective.

1. Low-carb, whole-food diet
The  low-carb, whole-food diet  is perfect for people who need to lose weight, optimize health, and lower their risk of disease.
It’s flexible, allowing you to fine-tune your  carb intake  depending on your goals.
This diet is high in vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, fruits, nuts, and fats but low in starches, sugars, and processed foods.

2. Mediterranean diet
The  Mediterranean diet  is an excellent diet that has been thoroughly studied. It’s particularly effective for heart disease prevention.
It emphasizes foods that were commonly eaten around the Mediterranean region during the 20th century and earlier.
As such, it includes plenty of vegetables, fruits, fish, poultry, whole grains, legumes, dairy products, and  extra virgin olive oil .

3. Paleo diet
The  paleo diet  is a very popular diet that is effective for weight loss and general health improvement. It’s currently the world’s most popular diet.
It centers on  unprocessed foods  believed to resemble those available to some of humanity’s paleolithic ancestors.

4. Vegan diet
The  vegan diet  has become increasingly popular in the past decade. It’s linked to a number of health benefits, including weight loss, improved heart health, and better blood sugar control.
The diet is based exclusively on  plant foods  and eliminates all animal products.

5. Gluten-free diet
The  gluten-free diet  is essential for people who are intolerant to gluten, a protein that is found in wheat, rye, and barley.
For optimal health, you should focus on whole foods that are naturally gluten-free. Gluten-free junk food is still  junk food .

The bottom line
So many diets exist that it can feel overwhelming to simply find a single one to try.
However, it’s important to note that some eating patterns have more scientific backing than others. Whether you’re looking to  lose weight  or simply boost your overall health, try to find diets that are supported by research.
The five examples listed above are a  good place to start .
