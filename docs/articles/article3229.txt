How it works
ICON Meals is a delivery service that specializes in providing fresh, chef-prepared meals that are both flavorful and nutritious.
Most meals are low in calories but high in protein and fiber, which may be ideal for those looking to lose weight or  improve the quality of their diet .
Not only does the company offer a weekly signature menu with a selection of fully prepared meals, but you can also order meal boxes, custom meals, and à la carte items.
Plus, unlike similar services, there are no subscription plans or bundles, giving you full flexibility to order as you desire.

Meal selection
ICON Meals features a rotating weekly menu with a variety of breakfast dishes and entrées to choose from.
Some of the recipes on the menu include:
BBQ chicken  pizza  with pickled onions
enchilada beef bake
high protein PB&J
bacon-wrapped shrimp, rice, and green beans
You can also purchase proteins, carbs, and veggies à la carte, or add extra snacks to your order, such as high protein popcorn, crisps, or beef bars.
Custom meals are also available, which allow you to choose a protein and two sides and select your preferred portion size.
Additionally, the service offers meal boxes that contain 12–24 meals.
A few of the available meal boxes include the Chef Box, Keto Box, and Lean Box.

Ingredients
ICON Meals uses a variety of ingredients in its dishes, including several types of proteins, grains, and veggies.
A full list of ingredients and nutrition facts is available for each recipe on the menu as well.
However, limited information is available on how the ingredients are sourced, and most meals contain conventional ingredients.
While this may not be an issue for many people, it can be an important consideration for those who prefer eating  organic  or sustainably sourced produce.

Taste and freshness
With a range of diverse herbs,  spices , and ingredients on the weekly menu, ICON Meals is designed to be both healthy and delicious.
Meals are shipped in packages with an eco-friendly liner and dry ice, which helps ensure that they remain fresh and cold during transit.
If you receive an order that’s damaged or incomplete, you can report it to customer service within 24 hours for immediate assistance.

Diet friendliness
ICON Meals offers several dishes on its signature menu that are suitable for different eating patterns, including high protein, low carb, and  ketogenic diets .
You can also order custom meals and breakfasts, which allow you to choose your favorite source of protein and up to two sides per meal.
This enables you to create meals that are suitable for other diet patterns, including vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, paleo, and gluten-free diets.
However, keep in mind that meals are produced in a facility that also processes gluten and other allergens, so it may not be suitable for those with celiac disease or severe food allergies.

Weight loss
Although ICON Meals is not specifically designed for  weight loss , it can be an easy and effective way to improve the quality of your diet and manage your weight, if that’s your goal.
In fact, most meals on the signature weekly menu contain fewer than 600 calories and are high in protein and fiber.
Consuming fewer calories than you burn during the day can be an effective strategy to support weight loss ( 1 ).
Increasing your  intake of protein  can also help increase feelings of fullness and reduce food cravings, which may aid weight loss as well ( 2 ).
What’s more, ICON Meals are high in fiber, which moves through your digestive tract slowly to decrease appetite and food intake ( 3 ,  4 ).

Price
Dishes from ICON Meals can be purchased individually, with prices ranging from $9–$12 each.
The prices for custom meals also vary depending on the specific items and portion sizes that you select, but they’re generally $7–$24 each.
Alternatively, you can order a meal box, which contains 12–24 meals for around $9–$10 per serving.
Delivery is available throughout the contiguous United States, and applicable shipping fees are calculated when you place your order.

Comparison with competitors
Besides ICON Meals, several other services also offer fully prepared, nutritionally balanced meals.
For instance, Trifecta Nutrition is a company that delivers fresh, healthy meals using high quality, organic ingredients.
Unlike ICON Meals, Trifecta Nutrition offers several plans catered to different eating patterns, including  paleo , keto, classic, vegan, and vegetarian diets.
However, while ICON Meals allows you to create your own meals by selecting certain proteins and side dishes, Trifecta Nutrition offers limited options for customization.
Factor is another meal delivery service that provides chef-crafted meals that are balanced and nutritious.
This company offers a rotating weekly menu, which features fully prepared meals suitable for ketogenic, paleo, low carb,  high protein , and vegetarian diets.
You can order 4–18 meals per week to build your own personalized menu, but, unlike ICON Meals, Factor doesn’t currently offer custom meals.

The bottom line
ICON Meals is a  meal delivery service  that provides nutritious, fully prepared entrées that are high in protein and fiber.
ICON Meals can not only be a good option for those hoping to save time on meal prep but also help promote weight loss and enhance your diet quality.
Plus, ICON Meals offers several options for customization, which may be a good fit for people with specific dietary restrictions or certain food preferences.
Still, ICON Meals may be unsuitable for people who have severe food allergies or intolerances, including celiac disease.
Because the company uses mostly conventional produce and offers limited information on its ingredient sourcing, it might also not be a good fit for those who prefer to eat organic.
