Title: Is AG1 Worth It? Our Take After Trying the Popular Greens Powder

AG1, formerly Athletic Greens, is a popular greens supplement, but is it worth the hype? Here’s what our dietitian says, plus an editor’s review after trying it herself.
We’re not always the biggest fans of greens powders because clinical research is lacking, and most brands (including AG1) don’t disclose amounts of individual nutrients, so it’s unclear whether there’s enough of each to have an effect.
AG1 (previously known as Athletic Greens) is a popular greens supplement, largely made famous by social media. But at almost $100 per package, is it worth buying?
The AG1 powder includes 75 vitamins, minerals, probiotics, whole food-sourced plant compounds, and  adaptogens  to support energy levels, immune health, gut health, healthy aging, and hormonal and neural health.
Our dietitian dove into the nutrition details, and our editor taste-tested the product to help you decide whether it’s worth buying.
Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the brands on this page, we considered all the vitamin brands that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further.

Our experience trying AG1
Healthline editor Christy Snyder tested AG1 daily for about a month, and this is her feedback.

Name:  Christy Snyder
Age:  36
Interest in AG1:  Looking to fill in the gaps in her vegetable and probiotic consumption



“I found that drinking 1 scoop of the AG1 as directed with 8-10 ounces (oz) of water wasn’t quite right for me. I ended up measuring out 12 oz of water to go with the AG1. It’s a flavor personal preference; it was a little too intense for me at both 8 oz and 10 oz of water — 12 oz is the sweet spot for my palate.
“I find that the AG1 bottle itself works best for mixing the powder into water. It is absolutely better shaken and not stirred.
“I like having it in the morning after I do my a.m. bike ride. I was pretty consistent but not perfect. It’s important to read the directions because the brand recommends that you take AG1 first thing in the morning on an empty stomach for optimal absorption.
“At first, I was drinking AG1 along with my eggs and fruit for breakfast, then realized I might want to test it on an empty stomach. Honestly, I don’t think it truly matters whether you take it on an empty stomach or not (the brand’s marketing materials say AG1 works at any time of day).”
“I liked the taste of AG1 far more than I expected to. It is similar to a matcha taste. That’s really the closest thing I can compare it to. It’s not bitter; it’s lightly sweet. It does taste ‘green’ if that makes sense, but not in a bad way. It doesn’t taste like kale. It’s actually very pleasant, and I looked forward to drinking it every day.
“If you shake it well (and shake the bottle a few times throughout your drinking experience) it tends to be less grainy and better mixed together, as you’d expect. The bottle it comes with works well for mixing in the powder.”
“I noticed that my nails started growing faster. Other than that, I couldn’t detect any other changes caused by it. It’d be nice to get blood work to see if there were any trackable wins from taking AG1 for a month.
“I do think AG1 would be great for folks looking to cut out having to take multiple vitamins and supplements. Like, I take a multivitamin and pre/probiotic pills separately, so it was nice to skip them for a bit and just try this.
“I also know that I don’t get my daily servings of fruits and vegetables; I tend to come in very low despite making my best effort. So I did feel like I was being healthier. But without any health data, I’m not sure if it’s worth the price.”
“It’s a tasty drink in my opinion, but I am not necessarily convinced it is worth the price and subscription. It seems like a good option for anyone who would like to reduce their supplement intake from multiple products into one simple drink. It’s great to know that you can get it all from one thing.”

Breaking down the active ingredients
AG1 includes four proprietary blends, all of which contain a variety of herbs, powdered fruits and vegetables, plant extracts, and other nutrients that may have some health benefits.
Just keep in mind that the company doesn’t disclose the exact amount of each ingredient in these blends, so it’s impossible to know whether a given ingredient is present in a large enough dose to have a meaningful effect.
This blend contains several nutrient-dense ingredients, including  spirulina . According to the company, the ingredients were chosen based on their ability to support a healthy  gut microbiome  and various other aspects of health.
For example, several ingredients — including  bilberry fruit extract ,  chlorella powder ,  pineapple fruit concentrate ,  beetroot powder , and  cocoa bean polyphenol extract  — have been linked to eye and heart health benefits, though more research is needed.
For gut health, the blend includes inulin, a  prebiotic fiber  that may help promote the  growth of beneficial bacteria  in the gut.
Ingredients:  organic spirulina, lecithin, organic apple powder, inulin, organic wheat grass juice powder, organic alfalfa powder, organic chlorella powder, organic barley leaf, acerola fruit juice powder extract, broccoli flower powder, papaya fruit powder, pineapple fruit concentrate, bilberry fruit extract, beetroot powder, rose hip fruit powder, carrot root powder, spinach leaf powder, cocoa bean polyphenol extract, grape seed extract, green tea extract, licorice root powder, Lycium berry fruit extract, ginger rhizome powder, slippery elm bark powder, kelp whole plant powder
This blend features antioxidants, plant extracts, and herbs, including adaptogens.
Adaptogens  are herbs that may help your body better adapt to stress, according to  research from 2021 . Ashwagandha, rhodiola, eleuthero root, and  dandelion root  are some of the adaptogens found in this proprietary blend.
Ingredients:  alkaline pea protein isolate, citrus bioflavonoids extract, artichoke leaf extract, citric acid, rhodiola root, eleuthero root extract, rosemary leaf extract, milk thistle seed extract, R,S alpha-lipoic acid, ashwagandha root extract, dandelion whole plant dry concentrate, hawthorn berry extract, beta-glucans, policosanol, coenzyme Q10, stevia leaf powder, vitamin K2
According to the company, this blend features ingredients with naturally occurring enzymes to support digestion and nutrient absorption.
Several ingredients, including  reishi mushroom powder  and shiitake mushroom powder, may also benefit immune health, though more  research  is needed.
Ingredients:  astragalus root powder, bromelain, burdock root powder, reishi mushroom powder, shiitake mushroom powder
The final blend includes two strains of  probiotics :
Lactobacillus acidophilus:  This is a common, beneficial probiotic found in your body and added to foods and supplements.  Research from 2022  has found that this strain can help regulate the balance of your gut microbiome by reducing intestinal pH, which helps keep “bad” bacteria, such as  E. coli , from colonizing in your gut.
Bifidobacterium bifidum:   Research from 2021  shows that this beneficial probiotic, which is found in the gut of infants and adults, may help fight inflammation, infection, and discomfort from  lactose intolerance  and constipation.

How much does AG1 cost?
Here’s a breakdown of how much AG1 costs, as well as key details about shipping and returns:
Shipping costs $9 for deliveries to the United States, Canada, and Australia. European shipping rates vary. The company also ships to China through the AG1 WeChat store.
If you’re unhappy with your purchase for any reason, you can return your AG1 for a full refund within 90 days of delivery.

Potential benefits
While AG1 hasn’t been studied to confirm its safety or effectiveness, it does have some potential benefits.
One serving of AG1 provides more than 100% of the DV for several vitamins, including vitamins C and E and all eight B vitamins. It’s also a good or excellent source of several other  essential vitamins and minerals .
This means that, like a  multivitamin , AG1 is a potentially convenient way for people to bridge nutrient gaps in their diet.
The supplement also contains several herbs, vegetable powders, fruit powders, and plant extracts that are rich in important plant compounds, such as antioxidants and  polyphenols .
Many customers say they notice increased energy levels after taking their daily AG1 supplement.
AG1 contains high doses of  all eight B vitamins .  Research from 2020  shows that with the exception of folate, these vitamins play an important role in energy production. Because of this, a deficiency in B vitamins can make you feel fatigued.
Drinking AG1 may therefore provide an energy boost for people who are not currently meeting their vitamin B needs through diet alone.
Use caution if you’re eating foods high in B vitamins or taking other supplements with B vitamins. There’s some  evidence of negative side effects  of excessive doses of vitamins B6 and B12 that could lead to temporary neuropathy and acne.
The company’s website also mentions  wheatgrass  as a potential energy-boosting ingredient.
A  2018 test-tube study  found that wheatgrass contains proteins involved in energy use and storage. However, there’s insufficient research to determine whether wheatgrass supplements have a meaningful effect on perceived energy levels.
AG1 includes sources of prebiotics and probiotics, which may benefit gut health.
For example,  research from 2020  has found that  Lactobacillus acidophilus , a probiotic strain commonly found in yogurt, may help maintain a  healthy balance  of good bacteria in your gut.
Still, keep in mind that prebiotics and probiotics are not recommended for everyone.
While probiotics may be indicated for certain individuals, such as those with traveler’s diarrhea or irritable bowel syndrome, some  experts  warn that, in generally healthy people,  probiotic supplements  could do more harm than good.
Additionally, prebiotics such as inulin may cause  unwanted side effects , including gas and  bloating , in some people.
AG1 products are  NSF Certified for Sport . This certification ensures that AG1 is free of substances banned by most competitive sports organizations.
This certification also indicates that the product has been tested for purity and potency. This means you can trust that AG1 contains the ingredients listed on the label and that it doesn’t contain unsafe levels of heavy metals or other contaminants.
AG1 is suitable for several dietary patterns, including:
vegetarian
vegan
paleo
keto
low carb
The supplement is also free of gluten, dairy, corn, egg, peanuts, lactose,  sucrose , dextrose, and artificial colors, preservatives, and sweeteners.

Potential downsides and considerations
Along with the numerous potential benefits of taking this greens powder, there are some significant downsides to consider.
The company markets AG1 as having the same  antioxidant  content as 12 servings of fruits and vegetables. This may lead some consumers to believe that the powder is a replacement for whole fruits and vegetables.
While AG1 does provide some important nutrients that are found in fruits and vegetables, there’s currently not enough evidence to show that consuming powdered forms of produce offers the same health benefits as eating  whole foods .
Additionally, AG1 doesn’t offer the same boost of fiber that you would get from eating whole fruits and vegetables.
The  USDA  recommends that adults consume 22 g to 34 g of fiber per day. One serving (1 scoop, or 12 g) of AG1 provides just 2 g of fiber.
Therefore, while it can help you get closer to meeting your fiber needs, you’ll still need to make sure you’re eating plenty of  fiber-rich foods  throughout the day, such as whole grains and whole fruits and vegetables.
This all-in-one nutritional supplement doesn’t include iron or vitamin D, two nutrients that a large percentage of the population  needs more of .
In fact, one survey suggests that  41.6%  of adults in the United States have insufficient vitamin D levels. And the World Health Organization estimates that up to  30%  of the world’s population is deficient in iron.
If you’re low in either of these nutrients, you’ll need to take an additional  vitamin D  or  iron supplement  to meet your needs.
Because AG1 doesn’t list the exact amount of each ingredient in its proprietary blends, it’s impossible to know whether you’re getting an effective dose of any of those ingredients.
Unknown ingredient amounts can also be problematic for people who are sensitive to any of the ingredients in the blends.
Some users report experiencing upset stomach, bloating, and diarrhea after taking AG1, which could be related to the inclusion of probiotics or  inulin .
Starting with a smaller amount of the powder and working your way up to a full serving may help minimize these effects.
AG1 contains several ingredients that  can interact  with prescription medications such as:
hormonal birth control
some diabetes medications
high blood pressure medications
immunosuppressants
sedatives
thyroid hormones
antidepressants
blood thinners
Before taking AG1, make sure to talk with a healthcare professional to find out whether it’s safe for you.
In addition to people who are taking certain prescription medications, AG1 may not be safe or appropriate for the following populations:
People who are pregnant or breastfeeding:  Many of AG1’s ingredients have either been shown to be unsafe or have little or no research on their safety in people who are  pregnant  or  breastfeeding .
Children:  AG1 should be consumed only by adults. The supplement contains ingredients that haven’t been proven safe for children and provides excessive vitamin and mineral doses for kids.
People with certain autoimmune conditions:  AG1 contains  alfalfa , which is generally not recommended for people with some  autoimmune conditions , such as  lupus .
People with end-stage kidney disease:  Because the supplement contains potassium and phosphorus, it may not be appropriate for people with  end-stage kidney disease .
If you have any concerns about whether AG1 is safe for you to take, it’s wise to talk with a trusted healthcare professional.

Company reputation
AG1 is manufactured in a facility that complies with the CGMPs established by the FDA. The product is also NSF Certified for Sport.
During Healthline’s  internal vetting process , we noted that AG1 doesn’t make any disease claims or unacceptable health claims about its product. However, the research and clinical evidence supporting several of its ingredients is limited.
The company has also invested heavily in an influencer marketing strategy. Many influencers who advertise AG1 products make health claims about the product even though they aren’t qualified nutrition or healthcare professionals.
The company has been involved in two lawsuits. In  2015 , the state of California alleged that AG1 products may be exposing consumers to levels of lead that exceed the threshold established under Proposition 65, officially known as the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986.
More recently, in  2020 , a former employee filed an alleged employment discrimination complaint. The lawsuit was dropped in 2022.
At the time of publication, AG1 has a  Better Business Bureau (BBB)  rating of C+ and is not BBB accredited.

AG1 alternatives
AG1 isn’t the only greens supplement on the market.
In fact, Healthline’s registered dietitians looked at more than 18 of the most popular  greens powders , and only  a handful of products , including AG1, passed our expert review and  internal vetting process .
Most products failed because they make unsubstantiated health claims, especially around detoxing. Others didn’t make the cut because they are noncompliant with  dietary supplement labeling guidelines  the FDA established.
But other options are viable.  Primal Greens  and  Amazing Grass  are more affordable but aren’t third-party tested. Primal Greens contains more active ingredients while Amazing Grass contains fewer. Both also have fewer calories per serving compared with AG1.
Here’s a closer look at how AG1 compares with one of the other greens powders:

Frequently asked questions
Because the supplement includes multiple vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and plant compounds, it may be worth trying if you:
have increased nutrient needs that you cannot meet through diet alone

are a competitive athlete looking for help meeting your nutritional needs
Still, keep in mind that while AG1 contains some research-backed ingredients, there’s currently no research to support its effectiveness.
Therefore, it may not be worth the cost for people who already take a multivitamin or maintain an overall balanced diet.
Furthermore, AG1 may not be safe or appropriate for certain populations, including:
children
people who are pregnant or breastfeeding
people who are taking certain prescription medications
people with end-stage kidney disease
people with certain autoimmune conditions

Some people report  stomach upset , bloating, and diarrhea after starting AG1. To help minimize the risk of unwanted side effects, it’s recommended to start with a smaller dose of AG1 and slowly increase the amount over a few days until you reach a full scoop.

There’s currently no research to show that consuming vegetables in powdered form has the same health benefits as eating whole fruits and  vegetables .
Therefore, although AG1 contains several important nutrients found in produce, it shouldn’t be used as a replacement for eating  whole food sources  of those nutrients, such as  leafy greens  and other vegetables.

AG1 can be an easy way to get several  essential nutrients  with one  low calorie drink , but it will not affect weight or weight loss on its own.

AG1 provides the body with 75 vitamins, minerals, and whole food ingredients, many of which support digestion, energy levels, and mood.
In addition to many essential vitamins and minerals that your body needs for optimal function, it also includes probiotics to support a diverse and healthy gut microbiome.

The bottom line
AG1 offers a convenient but expensive way to help fill nutrient gaps in your diet. Many of the product’s ingredients have some research to support their benefits, and happy customers note that they’ve noticed a  boost in energy levels  since trying the supplement.
However, no studies have been performed to confirm AG1’s safety or effectiveness. And because most of its ingredients are present in proprietary blends, it’s impossible to know whether AG1 contains effective doses of these ingredients and whether it’s effective.
While it shouldn’t replace eating whole fruits and vegetables, AG1 may be worth trying if you’re looking for an easy way to boost your intake of important vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds. It’s wise to first consult a healthcare professional.
