Title: The 6 Best Weight Gain Supplements, According to Dietitians

Whether you’re trying to increase your muscle mass or having difficulty maintaining your body weight, the most important factor for gaining weight is to increase your calorie consumption.
However, consuming enough calories from foods alone can sometimes be difficult, especially if you don’t have much of an appetite.
Supplement powders offer a convenient way to boost your calorie intake and support weight gain.
This article takes a closer look at the kinds of supplements that can be helpful for gaining weight, as well as our picks of the best ones to buy.

Can supplements help you gain weight?
Supplements can be effective for weight gain because they provide a concentrated source of calories and nutrients. However, they should be used only to supplement your diet — not as a replacement for whole, nutrient-rich foods.
“A weight gain supplement should not be the first point of attack when wanting to gain weight,” said  Laura Asbury , a registered dietitian and strength and conditioning coach. “Calories and nutrients must be in line in order to gain weight in a healthy and sustainable way.”
Also keep in mind that while some supplements may more directly help you gain weight by providing a boost of calories, others may have a more indirect effect by  supporting muscle gain .

Supplements for weight gain
Several types of supplements — protein powders, mass gainers, creatine, and pre-workouts — can help you gain weight if you use them in combination with a balanced diet.
In general, protein powders and mass gainers are your best bets if you’re simply looking to boost your calorie intake.
On the other hand, if you’re hoping to gain muscle mass through strength training, creatine powders and  pre-workouts  are worth considering.
Here is a closer look at each type.
Who they’re best for:  those unable to meet daily protein needs via food and those looking for a convenient way to increase protein intake
Potential side effects:  Side effects vary based on the ingredients. Those with lactose intolerance or a milk allergy should avoid protein supplements that contain those ingredients. Some protein supplements also include additives that may cause digestive distress in some people.
Protein plays an essential role in building and maintaining muscle mass. However, protein intake without a calorie surplus and an appropriate resistance training program will not result in building lean muscle mass.
In fact, research suggests that high protein diets may aid in weight loss because protein helps people feel full ( 1 ).
For this reason, if you use a protein supplement in a weight gain diet plan, it’s important to make sure you also maintain a calorie surplus.
One way to find out whether you’re eating enough calories is to  track your diet  on a few typical days to determine whether you need to adjust your total calorie intake. From there, you can also adjust your macronutrient intake as needed.
The recommended daily protein intake for active adults to build and maintain muscle is 0.6–0.9 grams (g) per pound (1.4–2.0 g per kilogram) of body weight per day. This amount has been found to support muscle growth and maintenance ( 2 ).
Keep in mind that protein supplements are not necessary if you can meet your daily protein needs through  whole food sources . However, supplements may be a convenient way to fit more protein into a busy schedule.

will not result in weight gain unless your diet has a calorie surplus
if low in calories, may not contribute enough calories to be helpful
may contain additives that can cause digestive upset in some people
Who they’re best for:  those who cannot maintain a calorie surplus through food alone
Potential side effects:  Active ingredients can vary widely among products, and these ingredient differences can affect the potential side effects. Some products may also have additives, such as artificial sweeteners, that could cause digestive distress.
Sometimes called  mass gainers , these supplements are often marketed as a way to gain muscle mass. Their ingredients and nutrition content can vary widely.
In general, mass gainers are higher in calories, fat, and carbs than traditional protein powders, though some may contain only carbohydrates.
According to Asbury, these products generally contain 300 or more calories per serving.
Adding weight gainers to your diet can certainly increase the number of calories you’re eating. However, some people find the taste and consistency of these products unpleasant.
Additionally, although these supplements can be convenient when you’re on the go, another option is  simply to eat more food , such as trail mix or smoothies, which would also provide other beneficial nutrients.

Who it’s best for:  people looking to build muscle and enhance athletic performance
Potential side effects:  It may lead to water retention in some people, and larger doses may result in gastrointestinal distress ( 3 ).
Creatine may have an indirect effect on lean muscle mass gains because of its potential to boost exercise performance.
When you take creatine as a supplement, the creatine concentration in your muscles increases. This can lead to  performance benefits  and muscle gain over time. However, most creatine supplements are low in calories and need to be combined with other ingredients to provide enough calories to support weight gain ( 4 ).
Creatine monohydrate is recognized as the most effective form of creatine and is the most common type used in  creatine supplements  ( 3 ).
The typical recommendation for creatine supplementation is to begin by taking a loading dose of approximately 20 g per day, split into 4 servings, for 5–7 days ( 4 ).
After this initial period, a dose of approximately 3–5 g per day is recommended for maintaining creatine levels.
Some people may experience short-term weight gain when starting creatine supplements, which can be attributed to changes in fluid balance.
“Total body water is increased with creatine supplementation, which could increase body weight. However, once creatine supplementation is stopped, phosphocreatine stores are diminished after 4–8 weeks, which may decrease body weight,” explained Asbury.

Who they’re best for:  people looking to enhance athletic performance while gaining weight
Potential side effects:  Side effects vary based on the ingredients. For example, beta-alanine can cause harmless tingling sensations. Caffeine can cause a jittery feeling and may negatively affect blood pressure, sleep, and stress levels in some people ( 5 ,  6 ).
Exercise, especially resistance training, is a necessary component of most weight gain plans.  Pre-workout supplements  may enable you to work out longer and at a higher intensity, which may indirectly lead to weight gain by contributing to muscle mass gain.
However, don’t depend on most pre-workout supplements to boost your daily calorie intake.
“At the end of the day, for someone to gain weight, they must be in a caloric surplus (eating more calories than they are metabolically burning), and pre-workout supplements are typically little to no calories,” explained Asbury.
The most common ingredients in pre-workout supplements are caffeine, beta-alanine,  nitrates , creatine, and citrulline malate, all of which may help boost exercise performance ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ).

A comparison of the best supplements for weight gain
Here’s a quick look at how our picks compare:

How to choose a weight gain supplement
You may want to consider the following factors when shopping for a weight gain supplement:
Weight and health goals:  If you want to boost your performance during workouts, a pre-workout or creatine supplement may be the best choice. However, if you want to increase your total calorie intake, a high calorie protein powder or mass gainer is a better option.
Calorie needs:  If you’re having trouble increasing calorie intake through food, opt for a higher calorie supplement such as a mass gainer or certain protein powders. Asbury said, “For a weight gain supplement to be of benefit, I try to find one that is 300 or more calories with at least 20 grams of protein and 60 grams of carbohydrates per serving.”
Current diet:  Supplements vary greatly in calorie, fat, carb, and protein composition. The best product for you will depend on nutrient gaps in your diet. Some products also provide additional micronutrients and fiber, which can be helpful if you cannot meet your needs for these substances through diet alone.
Dietary preferences:  Many weight gain supplements contain common allergens or may not be appropriate for people who follow a vegan diet. Make sure to select a product that fits your dietary needs and preferences.
Active ingredients:  Consider the active ingredients in the supplement and how they may contribute to your goals. For example, if you need to improve your performance during a workout and have optimized your nutrition, ingredients like  caffeine , creatine, and beta-alanine may be helpful.
Additives:  Supplements often have  additives , such as artificial sweeteners and colors, preservatives, or thickeners, that some people may prefer to avoid. Read supplement labels carefully to choose a product that best fits your needs and preferences.
Added sugar:  Keep in mind that some protein powders and mass gainers may contribute  excess amounts of added sugar  and should be avoided, especially if you already consume other sources of added sugar throughout the day.
Third-party testing:  To ensure that the contents match the label, it is best to select a supplement that has been third-party tested by a reputable organization, such as NSF International or Informed Sport.

Likely ineffective supplements
Supplements that increase your calorie or protein intake could  help you gain muscle  when combined with an appropriate exercise program, typically weight training ( 16 ,  17 ).
Other supplements that improve your exercise performance can provide a larger stimulus that your body must adapt to. This could lead to more muscle or weight gain over time.
However, some supplements have little evidence to suggest that they can increase weight or muscle gain on their own.
BCAAs  are critical for muscle growth ( 18 ).
Nearly all protein sources contain them, and any time you eat a complete protein source, you’re consuming BCAAs.
Research does not support the benefits of BCAA supplements for muscle gain ( 18 ).
Additionally, BCAA supplements are very low in calories and will not contribute much to the calorie surplus required for weight gain.
Despite their popularity, these supplements are not necessary for muscle gain if you’re consuming enough protein, and they’re not beneficial for increasing your total calorie intake.
The hormone testosterone plays an important role in the anabolic processes of your body, which are responsible for muscle growth ( 19 ).
Testosterone boosters  are a broad category of supplements that claim to increase levels of this hormone while enhancing muscle growth.
Ingredients commonly found in these supplements include  tribulus terrestris , fenugreek,  D-aspartic acid , ashwagandha, and DHEA.
Research shows mixed results on the effect these ingredients have on testosterone levels. A small number of studies have shown possible benefits of some ingredients in these products, but more evidence is needed ( 20 ,  21 ).
Some of these supplements could be more effective in people with low testosterone. But regardless, testosterone boosters do not typically live up to their marketing claims.
CLA  is a type of fatty acid found in animal products, specifically dairy and meats.
CLA supplements may affect body composition by contributing to a reduction in body fat and an increase in lean muscle mass. However, the research is inconclusive and shows mixed results ( 22 ).
Many studies suggest that CLA may be effective for weight loss ( 23 ).

Other tips for gaining weight
Total calorie intake from food is the most important component of weight gain. But if you’re interested in increasing muscle mass, you’ll also need to regularly engage in resistance exercise.
Here are two tips from Asbury for increasing your calorie intake from foods:
Add healthy fats:  “ Healthy fats  have 9 calories per gram, compared to protein and carbohydrates that are 4 calories per gram. Increasing these foods will take up less room in the stomach and allow for more calories to be taken in at one time.” Nut butters,  chia seeds , avocado, and whole milk are some foods that contain healthy fats.
Focus on meal timing:  “Eating a meal or snack every 2–3 hours and not skipping meals will be necessary in gaining weight in a healthy way.”

When to consult your doctor
Weight gain goals related to increasing muscle mass for aesthetic or performance reasons are unlikely to require medical intervention. However, it’s always best to consult a doctor or another trusted healthcare professional before starting a new supplement regimen.
When you’ve lost weight as a result of illness or experienced  unexplained weight loss , you should discuss it with your doctor to identify the underlying cause and the next steps for weight gain.
Additionally, if you have a history of  disordered eating , consider working with a health professional, such as a registered dietitian. They will be able to help you identify the best way to reach your weight goals while ensuring that you’re getting the nutrients you need for a healthy diet.

Exercise is important for building and maintaining lean muscle mass. If your goal for weight gain is to modify your body composition by increasing lean muscle mass and reducing body fat, then exercise should be part of your weight gain plan.
However, keep in mind that working out contributes to a calorie deficit and it’s important to consume enough calories to support your weight goals.

The bottom line
The most important lifestyle factors that will allow you to gain weight and muscle are proper nutrition and strength training.
Specifically, you need to eat more calories than your body uses and eat more protein than your body breaks down.
Some products, such as mass gainers, offer a concentrated source of calories and nutrients to directly help you gain weight, while others may help boost athletic performance and support muscle gains.
If you want to gain weight, be sure to talk with a healthcare professional to make sure that your exercise regimen and nutritional habits are optimized to help you reach your goals.
