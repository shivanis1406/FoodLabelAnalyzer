Title: 13 Effective Substitutes for Eggs

You can replace eggs in recipes with a variety of other foods, including applesauce, ground flaxseed, yogurt, and some kinds of tofu.
Eggs are  incredibly healthy  and versatile, making them a popular food for many. They’re especially common in baking, where nearly every recipe calls for them.
But for various reasons like having  an egg allergy  or following  a vegan diet , some people avoid eggs. Fortunately, there are plenty of replacements you can use instead.
This article explores the various ingredients that can be used as egg alternatives.

1. Applesauce
Applesauce is a purée made from cooked  apples . It’s often sweetened or flavored with other spices like  nutmeg  and  cinnamon .
Using  1/4 cup (about 65 grams (g))  of applesauce can replace an egg in most recipes.
It’s best to use unsweetened applesauce. If you’re using a sweetened variety, you should reduce the amount of sugar or sweetener in the recipe itself.

2. Mashed banana
Mashed  banana  is another popular replacement for eggs. The only downside to baking with  bananas  is that your finished product may have a mild banana flavor.
Other puréed fruits like  pumpkin  and  avocado  work too and may not affect the flavor as much.
Whichever fruit you choose to use, you can replace each egg with  half of a large banana.
Baked goods made with puréed fruits may not brown as deeply, but they will be very dense and moist.
This substitution works best in cakes, muffins, brownies, and quick breads.

3. Ground flaxseeds or chia seeds
Flaxseeds  and  chia seeds  are both tiny seeds that are  highly nutritious.
They’re high in omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and other beneficial plant compounds.
You can grind the seeds yourself at home or buy a ready-made seed meal from the store.
To replace one egg, whisk together  1 tablespoon (tbsp) (7 g)  of ground chia or flaxseed with 3 tbsp (45 g) of water until fully absorbed and thickened.
Doing so may cause baked goods to become heavy and dense. Also, it may result in a nuttier flavor, so it works best in products like pancakes, waffles, muffins, breads, and cookies.

4. Commercial egg replacer
There are a variety of commercial egg replacers on the market. These are typically made from potato starch,  tapioca  starch, and leavening agents.
Egg replacers are suitable for all baked goods and should not affect the flavor of the finished product.
Some commercially available brands include  Bob’s Red Mill ,  Ener-G , and  Orgran . You can find them at many supermarkets and online.
Each brand comes with its own instructions, but typically you combine  1.5 teaspoons (tsp) (10 g)  of powder with 2–3 tbsp (30–45 g of warm water to replace 1 egg.

5. Silken tofu
Tofu  is condensed soy milk that has been processed and pressed into solid blocks.
The texture of tofu varies based on its water content. The more water that’s pressed out, the firmer the tofu gets.
Silken tofu has a high water content, which means it has a softer consistency.
To replace 1 egg, substitute  1/4 cup (about 60 g)  of puréed, silken tofu.
Silken tofu is relatively flavorless, but it can make baked goods dense and heavy, so it’s best used in brownies, cookies, quick breads, and cakes.

6. Vinegar and baking soda
Mixing  1 tsp (7 g)  of  baking soda  with 1 tbsp (15 g) of  vinegar  can replace 1 egg in most recipes.
When mixed together, vinegar and baking soda start a chemical reaction that produces carbon dioxide and water, which makes baked goods light and airy.
This substitution works best for cakes, cupcakes, and quick breads.

7. Yogurt or buttermilk
Both  yogurt  and  buttermilk  are good substitutes for eggs. It’s best to use plain  yogurt , as flavored and sweetened varieties may alter the flavor of your recipe.
You can use  1/4 cup  (60 g) of yogurt or buttermilk for each egg that needs to be replaced.
This substitution works best for muffins, cakes, and cupcakes.

8. Arrowroot powder
Arrowroot  is a South American tuber plant that is high in starch. The starch is extracted from the roots of the plant and sold as a powder, starch, or flour.
It resembles  corn  starch and is used in cooking, baking, and a variety of personal and household products. You can find it at many health food stores and online.
A mixture of  2 tbsp (about 18 g)  of arrowroot powder and 3 tbsp (45 g) of water can be used to replace 1 egg.

9. Aquafaba
Aquafaba  is the term for the leftover liquid from cooking beans or legumes. It’s the same liquid that’s found in  canned chickpeas  or beans.
The liquid has a very similar consistency to that of  raw egg whites , making it an excellent substitution for many recipes.
You can use  3 tbsp (45 g)  of aquafaba to replace 1 egg.
Aquafaba works especially well in recipes that call for just egg whites, such as meringues,  marshmallows , macaroons, or nougat.

10. Nut butter
Nut butter like  peanut ,  cashew , or  almond butter  can also be used to substitute eggs in most recipes.
To replace one egg, use  3 tbsp (60 g)  of nut butter.
This may affect the flavor of your finished product, and it’s best used in brownies, pancakes, and cookies.
You should also make sure to use creamy nut butter rather than chunky varieties so that everything mixes properly.

11. Carbonated water
Carbonated water  can add moisture to a recipe, but it also acts as a great leavening agent. The carbonation traps air bubbles, which help make the finished product light and fluffy.
You can replace each egg with  1/4 cup (60 g)  of carbonated water.
This substitution works great for cakes, cupcakes, and quick breads.

12. Agar-agar or gelatin
Gelatin  is a gelling agent that makes a great substitute for eggs.
However, it’s an animal protein that is typically derived from the collagen of pigs and cows. If you avoid animal products, agar-agar is a vegan alternative obtained from a type of  seaweed  or algae.
Both can be found as unflavored powders in most supermarkets and health food stores or online.
To replace 1 egg, dissolve  1 tbsp (about 9 g)  of unflavored gelatin in 1 tbsp (15 g) of cold water. Then, mix in 2 tbsp (30 g) of boiling water until frothy.
Alternatively, you can use 1 tbsp (9 g) of agar-agar powder mixed with 1 tbsp (15 g) of water to replace 1 egg.
Neither of these replacements should affect the flavor of your finished product, but they may create a slightly stiffer texture.

13. Soy lecithin
Soy  lecithin is a byproduct of  soybean  oil and has binding properties similar to that of eggs. It’s frequently added to commercially prepared foods because of its ability to mix and hold ingredients together. But obviously, this is one to skip if you have a soy allergy.
It’s also sold in powder form in most health food stores and online.
Adding  1 tbsp (14 g)  of soy lecithin powder to your recipe can replace 1 egg.

Frequently asked questions
There are various reasons why you may need to find a substitute for eggs in your diet, including:
Eggs are the second most  common food allergy  among children in the United States. It affects  0.9% of all children , 1.3% of children younger than age 5, and about  0.8%  of adults.
Some individuals follow a  vegan diet  and choose not to eat meat, dairy, eggs, or any other animal products.
Eggs serve several purposes in baking. They  contribute  to the structure, color, flavor, and consistency of baked goods in the following ways:
Binding : Eggs help combine ingredients and hold them together.
Leavening : Eggs trap air pockets in foods, causing them to expand during heating. This helps foods puff up or rise.
Moisture : The egg liquid is absorbed into the other ingredients in a recipe.
Flavor and appearance : Eggs help carry the flavors of other ingredients and brown when exposed to heat.
The ingredients shared in this article are great substitutes for whole eggs, but some recipes call for just  egg whites  or  egg yolks .
Here are the best replacements for each:
Aquafaba is the best option. Use 3 tbsp (45 g) for each egg white you want to replace.
Soy lecithin is a great substitute. You can replace each large egg yolk with 1 tbsp (14 g).
If you’re looking to try a commercial egg replacement product, make sure it’s a replacement product and not a substitute.
Egg substitutes are  typically found  in the dairy section of the grocery store and are primarily targeted toward individuals concerned about their  cholesterol levels .
They may still contain some eggs and are, therefore, not suited for people with allergies or anyone who wants to avoid eggs. If you’re unsure,  read the label carefully  to make sure there is no egg in the product you wish to buy.

The bottom line
Eggs contribute to the overall structure, color, flavor, and consistency of baked goods.
Some people cannot eat eggs or choose not to. Luckily, plenty of foods can replace eggs in baking, though not all of them act the same way.
Some egg alternatives are better for heavy, dense products, while others are great for light and fluffy baked goods.
You may need to experiment with various egg alternatives to get the texture and flavor you desire in your recipes.
