Title: 29 Ways to Lose Weight Naturally (Backed by Science)

Eating fewer processed foods, drinking more green tea, and taking probiotics are just a few of the natural methods that can promote weight loss. Establishing an exercise or a sleep routine can also help.
There’s a lot of bad weight loss information on the internet. Much of what’s recommended is questionable at best, and not based on any actual science.
However, there are several natural methods that have actually been proven to work. Here’s how to get started.

What is the easiest way to lose weight naturally?
Here are 29 natural ways to lose weight and the science behind them.

1. Add protein to your diet
When it comes to weight loss,  protein  is the king of nutrients.
Your body burns calories when digesting and metabolizing the protein you eat, so a  high-protein diet  can boost metabolism by  up to 80–100  calories per day ( 1 ,  2 )
A high-protein diet can also make you feel more full and  reduce your appetite . In fact, some studies show that people eat over 400 fewer calories per day on a high-protein diet ( 3 ,  4 ).
Even something as simple as eating a  high-protein breakfast  (like eggs) can have a powerful effect ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 )

2. Prioritize whole, single-ingredient foods
One of the best things you can do to become healthier is to base your diet on  whole, single-ingredient foods .
By doing this, you eliminate the vast majority of added sugar, added fat, and processed food.
Most whole foods are naturally  very filling , making it a lot easier to keep within typical calorie limits ( 7 ).
Eating whole foods also provides your body with the many  essential nutrients  that it needs to function properly.
Weight loss often follows as a natural side effect of eating whole foods.

3. Limit processed foods
Processed foods  are usually high in added sugars, added fats, and calories.
What’s more, processed foods are engineered to make you eat as much as possible. They’re much more likely to cause  addictive-like  eating than unprocessed foods ( 8 ).

4. Stock up on nutritious foods and snacks
Studies have shown that the food you keep at home greatly affects weight and eating behavior ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ).
By always having  nutrient-dense food  available, you reduce the chances of you or other family members eating less nutritious items.
There are also many nutritious snacks that are easy to prepare and take with you on the go. These include yogurt, whole  fruit ,  nuts ,  carrots , and  hard-boiled eggs .

5. Limit your intake of added sugar
Eating a lot of  added sugar  is linked with some of the world’s leading diseases, including  heart disease ,  type 2 diabetes , and  cancer  ( 12 ,  13 ,  14 ).
On average, Americans eat about 15 teaspoons of added sugar each day. This amount is usually hidden in various processed foods, so you may be consuming a lot of sugar without even realizing it ( 15 ).
Since sugar goes by  many names  in ingredient lists, it can be very difficult to figure out how much sugar a product actually contains.
Minimizing your intake of added sugar is a great way to improve your diet.

6. Drink water
There’s actually truth to the claim that  drinking water  can help with weight loss.
Drinking 0.5 liters (17 oz) of water may increase the calories you burn by 24–30% for an hour afterward ( 16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  19 ).
Drinking water before meals  may also lead to reduced calorie intake, especially for middle-aged and older people ( 20 ,  21 ).
Water is particularly helpful for weight loss when it replaces other beverages that are high in calories and sugar ( 22 ,  23 ).

7. Drink (unsweetened) coffee
Coffee  is loaded with antioxidants and other beneficial compounds.
Coffee drinking may support weight loss by increasing energy levels and the amount of calories you burn ( 24 ,  25 ,  26 ).
Caffeinated coffee may boost your metabolism by 3–11% and  reduce your risk  of developing type 2 diabetes by a whopping 23–50% ( 27 ,  28 ,  29 ).
Furthermore,  black coffee  is very weight loss friendly, since it can make you feel full but contains almost no calories.

8. Supplement with glucomannan
Glucomannan  is one of several  weight loss pills  that has been proven to work. This water-soluble, natural dietary fiber comes from the roots of the konjac plant, also known as the elephant yam.
Glucomannan is low in calories, takes up space in the stomach, and delays  stomach emptying . It also reduces the absorption of protein and fat, and feeds the beneficial gut bacteria ( 30 ,  31 ,  32 ).
Its exceptional ability to absorb water is believed to be what makes it so effective for weight loss. One capsule is able to turn an entire glass of water into gel.

9. Limit liquid calories
Liquid calories come from beverages like  sugary soft drinks ,  fruit juices ,  chocolate milk , and  energy drinks .
These drinks can have a negative impact on your health in several ways, including an increased risk of  obesity . One study showed a drastic 60% increase in the risk of obesity among children for each daily serving of a sugar-sweetened beverage ( 33 ).
It’s also important to note that your brain does not register liquid calories the same way it does solid calories, so you end up adding these calories on top of everything else that you eat ( 34 ,  35 ).

10. Limit your intake of refined carbs
Refined carbs  are carbs that have had most of their beneficial nutrients and fiber removed.
The refining process leaves nothing but easily digested carbs, which can increase the risk of  overeating  and disease ( 36 ,  37 ).
The main dietary sources of refined carbs are white flour,  white bread ,  white rice , sodas, pastries, snacks, sweets, pasta,  breakfast cereals , and added sugar.

11. Fast intermittently
Intermittent fasting  is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting and eating.
There are a few different ways to do intermittent fasting, including  the 5:2 diet ,  the 16:8 method , and the  eat-stop-eat method .
Generally, these methods make you eat fewer calories overall, without having to consciously restrict calories during the eating periods. This should lead to weight loss, as well as numerous other health benefits ( 38 ).

12. Drink (unsweetened) green tea
Green tea  is a natural beverage that’s loaded with antioxidants. Drinking green tea is linked with many benefits, such as increased  fat burning  and weight loss ( 39 ,  40 ).
Green tea may increase energy expenditure by 4% and increase selective fat burning by up to 17%, especially harmful belly fat ( 41 ,  42 ,  43 ,  44 ).
Matcha tea  is a variety of powdered green tea that may have even more powerful health benefits than regular green tea.

13. Eat more fruits and vegetables
Fruits  and  vegetables  are extremely nutritious, weight-loss-friendly foods.
In addition to being high in water, nutrients, and fiber, they usually have very low energy density. This makes it possible to eat large servings without consuming excess calories.
Numerous studies have shown that people who eat more fruits and vegetables tend to weigh less ( 45 ,  46 ).

14. Count calories once in a while
Being aware of what you’re eating is very helpful when trying to lose weight.
There are several effective ways to do this, including  counting calories ,  keeping a food diary , or taking pictures of what you eat ( 47 ,  48 ,  49 ).
Using an  app  or another electronic tool may be even more beneficial than writing in a food diary ( 50 ,  51 ).

15. Use smaller plates
Some studies have shown that using smaller plates helps you eat less, because it changes how you see  portion sizes  ( 52 ,  53 ).
People seem to  fill their plates  the same, regardless of plate size, so they end up putting more food on larger plates than smaller ones ( 54 ).
Using smaller plates reduces how much food you eat, while giving you the perception of having eaten more ( 55 ).

16. Try a low-carb diet
Many studies have shown that  low-carb diets  are effective for weight loss.
Limiting  carbs  and eating more fat and protein reduces your appetite and helps you eat fewer calories ( 56 ).
This can result in weight loss that is up to 3 times greater than that from a standard low-fat diet ( 57 ,  58 ).
A low-carb diet can also  improve  many risk factors for disease.

17. Eat more slowly
If you eat too fast, you may eat more calories than your body needs before your body even realizes that you’re full ( 59 ,  60 ).
Fast eaters are much more likely to develop obesity, compared to those who  eat more slowly  ( 61 ).
Chewing more slowly may help you eat fewer calories and increase the  production of hormones  that are linked to weight loss ( 62 ,  63 ).

18. Add eggs to your diet
Eggs are the ultimate weight loss food. They’re low in calories, high in protein, and loaded with all sorts of nutrients.
High-protein foods  have been shown to reduce appetite and increase fullness, compared to foods that contain less protein ( 64 ,  65 ,  66 ,  67 ).
Furthermore, eating  eggs  for breakfast may cause up to 65% greater weight loss over 8 weeks, compared to eating  bagels  for breakfast. It may also help you eat fewer calories throughout the rest of the day ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  67 ).

19. Spice up your meals
Chili peppers  and  jalapeños  contain a compound called  capsaicin , which may boost metabolism and increase the burning of fat ( 68 ,  69 ,  70 ,  71 ).
Capsaicin may also reduce appetite and calorie intake ( 68 ,  72 ).

20. Take probiotics
Probiotics  are live bacteria that have health benefits when eaten. They can improve  digestive health  and  heart health , and may even help with with weight loss ( 73 ,  74 ).
Studies have shown that people who are overweight and people who have obesity tend to have different gut bacteria than average-weight people, which may influence weight ( 75 ,  76 ,  77 ).
Probiotics may help regulate the healthy gut bacteria. They may also block the absorption of dietary fat, while reducing appetite and inflammation ( 78 ,  79 ,  80 ).
Of all the probiotic bacteria,  Lactobacillus gasseri  shows the most promising effects on weight loss ( 81 ,  82 ,  83 ).

21. Get enough sleep
Getting enough  sleep  is incredibly important for weight loss, as well as to prevent future weight gain.
Studies have shown that sleep-deprived people are up to 55% more likely to develop obesity, compared to those who get enough sleep. This number is even higher for children ( 84 ).
This is partly because  sleep deprivation  disrupts the daily fluctuations in  appetite hormones , leading to poor appetite regulation ( 85 ,  86 ).

22. Eat more fiber
Fiber-rich foods  may help with weight loss. Foods that contain  water-soluble fiber  may be especially helpful, since this type of fiber can help increase the feeling of fullness.
Fiber may delay stomach emptying, make the stomach expand and promote the release of satiety hormones ( 87 ,  88 ,  89 ). This can help you eat less without having to think about it.
Many types of fiber can feed the friendly gut bacteria. Healthy gut bacteria have been linked with a reduced risk of obesity ( 90 ,  91 ,  92 ).
Just make sure to increase your fiber intake gradually to avoid abdominal discomfort, such as  bloating ,  cramps , and  diarrhea .

23. Brush your teeth after meals
Many people  brush  or  floss  their teeth or use  mouthwash  after eating.
Dental hygiene products can temporarily affect the taste of food and beverages, which may help limit the desire to snack or eat between meals ( 93 ).

24. Work to overcome food addiction
Food addiction  involves overpowering cravings and changes in your brain chemistry that make it harder to resist eating certain foods.
This is a major cause of overeating for many people, and affects a significant percentage of the population. In fact, a recent 2014 study found that almost 20% of people fulfilled the criteria for food addiction ( 94 ).
Some foods are much more likely to cause symptoms of addiction than others. This includes highly processed junk foods that are high in sugar, fat, or both.
Consulting with a  healthcare professional  can help.

25. Do some sort of cardio
Doing  cardio  — whether it’s jogging, running, cycling, power walking, or hiking — is a great way to burn calories and improve both mental and physical health.
Cardio has been shown to improve many risk factors for heart disease. It can also help reduce body weight ( 95 ,  96 ).
Cardio seems to be particularly effective at reducing  the fat that builds up  around your organs and causes metabolic disease ( 97 ,  98 ).

26. Add resistance exercises
Loss of muscle mass  is a common side effect of dieting. If you lose a lot of muscle, your body will start burning fewer calories than before ( 99 ,  100 ).
Resistance exercises, like  lifting weights , can help prevent this loss in muscle mass ( 101 ,  102 ).

27. Use whey protein
Most people get enough protein from diet alone. However, for those who don’t, taking a  whey protein supplement  is an effective way to boost protein intake.
One study shows that replacing part of your calories with whey protein can cause significant weight loss, while also increasing  lean muscle mass  ( 103 ,  104 ).
Just make sure to read the ingredients list, because some varieties are loaded with sugar and other additives.

28. Practice mindful eating
Mindful eating  is a method used to increase awareness while eating.
It helps you make conscious food choices and develop awareness of your hunger and satiety cues. It then helps you eat well in response to those cues ( 105 ).
Mindful eating has been shown to have significant effects on weight, eating behavior, and stress in individuals who have obesity. It’s especially helpful against  binge eating  and  emotional eating  ( 106 ,  107 ,  108 ).
By making conscious food choices, increasing your awareness, and listening to your body, weight loss should follow.

29. Focus on changing your lifestyle
Dieting is one of those things that almost always fails in the long term. In fact, people who “diet” tend to gain more weight over time ( 109 ).
Instead of focusing only on losing weight, make it a primary goal to nourish your body with nutritious food and  daily movement .

Frequently asked questions
Three effective ways to lose 20 pounds include:
reduce and limit the refined carbs in your diet
include protein, fat, and vegetables at each meal
watch your  portion sizes
move more – resistance training with weights is an excellent exercise to help you lose weight
Doctors recommend a weight loss of no more than 1-2 pounds per week, so losing 20 pounds in one month is not a health goal and may be harmful, especially if you have any chronic health conditions.
Doctors recommend a weight loss of no more than 1-2 pounds per week. Trying to lose  10 pounds in one week  may be harmful to you, especially if you have any chronic health conditions. Creating a long-term plan for reaching healthy diet and fitness goals may be a more effective way to reach your desired weight.
