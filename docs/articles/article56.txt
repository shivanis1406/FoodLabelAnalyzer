Title: 30 Delicious and Healthy Keto Snacks

There are many high fat, low carb snack options available that are flavorful, nutritious, and easy to fit into a ketogenic diet.
When you’re on a keto diet, snacking is a little more complicated.
The keto diet involves sticking to foods that are high in protein and fat, but most popular foods in the snack aisle are heavy in carbs.
Worry not! All joy is not lost. There are plenty of delicious keto snacks still available to you. These options are packed with nutrients and likely to keep you full until the next mealtime.
Here are 30 keto-friendly snacks to include in your next meal plan.

1. Mini frittatas
Mini frittatas, or  egg  muffins, are a great keto-friendly snack that’s easy to prepare and fully customizable.
All you need to get started is:
a dozen eggs
standard 12-cup muffin pan
mixing bowl
an oven
To begin, beat the eggs in a bowl and season with a little salt and pepper.
Distribute the egg mixture evenly between each muffin cup and add your preferred low carb ingredients like:
spinach
mushrooms
tomatoes
cheese
Bake at 350°F (180°C) for about 15–20 minutes, or until set.
Exact nutrition information varies depending on what you add to your recipe.
Each egg contains less than 0.5 grams (g) of carbs. Other ingredients like  spinach , mushrooms, tomatoes, and cheese are also very low in carbs ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
Store them in the refrigerator so you can easily grab a couple on your way out, or bake a few batches and freeze them for later.

2. Caprese salad skewers
Caprese salad is a classic Italian favorite. When you assemble the ingredients on skewers, it turns into a great portable snack.
Preparing it is as easy as alternating pieces of fresh mozzarella cheese, basil leaves, and cherry tomatoes onto skewers. Eat it plain or mix a little balsamic vinegar and  olive oil  for dipping.
1 ounce (oz), or 28 g, of mozzarella contains about 0.7 g of carbs. Fresh basil and cherry tomatoes are also very low in carbs ( 6 ,  7 ,  8 ).

3. Caesar salad bites
If you’re a fan of Caesar salad, you’ll love these mini Caesar salad bites. You can use romaine lettuce if you want to keep it classic, but a heartier type of green like  kale  holds up better if you’re not planning to eat them right away.
Make individual cups to hold the salad by heating small portions of grated  Parmesan cheese  on a parchment-lined baking pan. Bake until the cheese has melted and is starting to brown.
Let the melted cheese portions cool slightly before placing each over the bottom side of a mini muffin pan, lightly pressing the cheese into the shape of the muffin cups. Let them cool completely, and they’ll turn into small, edible, crispy cups.
Toss the greens with your favorite dressing and portion into each Parmesan cup. In lieu of croutons, top with roasted pumpkin seeds or pistachios for extra crunch. For  more protein , add chopped chicken or smoked salmon.

4. Cajun style shrimp and bell pepper kebabs
Shrimp  are a great source of heart-healthy omega-3 fats. They’re also lower in mercury than other types of seafood, making them a healthy and keto-friendly snack option ( 9 ).
First, use a Cajun style dry rub on the shrimp. Place the seasoned shrimp on skewers, alternating with thick slices of fresh bell pepper.
Bake or grill the kebabs until the shrimp is fully cooked and the peppers are between crisp and tender. Serve right away, or store in the refrigerator until you’re ready to eat.

5. Veggie sticks with nut butter
Pairing fresh or lightly cooked vegetables with your favorite nut butter is one of the simplest, most nutrient-rich snacks you can make.
Nuts are loaded with heart healthy fats. Research suggests that regularly eating nuts may improve  insulin sensitivity  and increase satiety, which could potentially help with weight loss ( 10 ,  11 ).
A 2-tablespoon (tbsp), or 32-g, serving of peanut butter, without added oil, typically packs around 16 g of fat and 7 g of carbs, 1.6 g of which is fiber. Dip raw carrots in almond butter or try pairing  peanut butter  with celery sticks ( 12 ).
If you’re not making your own nut butter, be sure to check the label of the type you purchase, as some recipes contain  added sugar .

6. Salmon salad celery boats
Salmon  is not only a good source of omega-3 fats and protein but also vitamin D, a nutrient many people don’t get enough of ( 13 ).
A 3.5-oz (100-g) serving of canned salmon provides over half of the daily value (DV) for  vitamin D , and it can quickly be made into a salad that suits a keto diet ( 14 ).
Combine cooked salmon and mayonnaise to make a simple, keto-friendly salad. You can customize the recipe by adding fresh herbs, spices, garlic, or lemon.
Serve the salmon salad stuffed into fresh celery stalks for an extra nutrient boost and satisfying crunch.

7. Keto sushi rolls
Keto sushi rolls are excellent nutrient rich snacks that come together in as little as 15 minutes. All you need is a pack of nori  seaweed  sheets and some uniformly chopped veggies and fish to use for filling.
You can use raw, sushi grade  fish , but it’s not necessary. Smoked fish or no fish at all — plus lots of veggies like avocado, bell pepper, and cucumber — will work just as well.
To boost the fat content, you can add cream cheese or serve it with a spicy peanut sauce — just make sure it doesn’t contain added sweetener.
To assemble the sushi, simply lay out the nori and dampen the edges with a little water. Lay your filling on the nori sheet and roll it tightly. Slice it into bite sized pieces or eat it like a wrap.

8. Collard green sandwich wraps
Collard greens are loaded with essential nutrients, including ( 15 ).
folate
calcium
vitamins K, C, and A
What’s more, their large, hearty leaves lend themselves well to a low carb sandwich wrap.
After trimming the stems, place the collards in a pot of simmering water for 20 to 30 seconds. Remove them from the pot and place immediately into a bowl of ice water for a few seconds. Pat them dry with a clean towel and begin making your sandwich wraps.
Fill your wraps with items like:
fresh herbs
avocado
chicken salad
tuna salad
sliced turkey
roasted veggies
cream cheese

9. Avocado egg salad
Avocados  are loaded with ( 16 ):
heart-healthy fats
fiber
vitamins
minerals
anti-inflammatory compounds
Some research even suggests they may support weight loss, reduce the risk of heart disease, and improve brain function and gut health ( 17 ).
Using avocado as a substitute for mayonnaise in traditional egg salad is a great way to boost the nutritional content of this classic dish while still keeping your snack keto-compatible.
Combine a few diced,  hard-boiled eggs , mashed avocado, minced red onion, and a bit of salt and pepper.
Serve with:
lettuce wraps
celery sticks
thick slices of cucumber and radish

10. Veggie sticks with guacamole
Guacamole makes a great, portable, and healthy keto snack, as  avocados  are loaded with fat, fiber, and a hefty dose of essential nutrients. In fact, half an avocado (75 g) contains 11 g of fat and 5 g of fiber ( 16 ).
To make guacamole, simply mash a ripe avocado and combine with lime juice, diced red onion, and salt and pepper. Fresh  jalapeño  makes an excellent addition, too.
If you’re not up for making your own, you can buy pre-made and individually packaged guacamole. Although guacamole is good to eat by itself, you can also use sweet bell peppers, red radishes, celery, or broccoli for dipping.

11. Bone broth
If you crave something light and warming, bone broth makes a perhaps unexpected but tasty snack option for keto dieters.
Unlike traditional broth,  bone broths  are cooked longer and typically contain more protein. Some commercially prepared bone broths boast up to 10 g of protein per cup (240 millilliters) ( 18 ).
Bone broths don’t typically provide much fat, but you can easily augment this by adding coconut oil, butter, or  ghee .
You can make your own bone broth on the stove top or with a slow cooker or pressure cooker. Make a big batch and freeze it in individual servings that are easy to heat up when you crave a warm, comforting snack.
If you opt for a commercially prepared brand, be sure to check the ingredient label, as some of them harbor added sweeteners and are high in sodium.

12. Keto smoothies
If you follow a keto diet and thought smoothies would be forever off limits due to their typically high carb content, you’re in luck.
You can make  keto-friendly smoothies  using coconut, avocado, and nut butter as a base to boost fat content and provide a creamy texture.
Small amounts of low carb fruits, such as berries, lime, or lemon, may be used in a keto smoothie, but you should also include nutrient dense veggies like spinach, cucumber, kale, or jicama.
Other flavorful additions include:
cacao
cinnamon
vanilla extract
flavored protein powders

13. Mixed nuts
Nuts  are full of protein, fat, fiber, and plant compounds that offer a variety of health benefits. In fact, some research associates a higher intake of nuts with a reduced risk of heart disease and cancer-related death ( 19 ).
Just 1/4 cup (28 g) of mixed nuts provides approximately 15 g of fat, 6 g of protein, 6 g of carbs, and 2 g of fiber ( 20 ).
You can buy pre-packaged mixed nuts or build your own mix using your favorites. If you go for the pre-made option, be sure to check the label for any added ingredients that don’t fit into your diet plan.
Almonds, cashews, Brazil nuts, pistachios, walnuts, and pecans are good options for your own keto-friendly trail mix.
Other nutritious additions include:
sunflower seeds
pumpkin seeds
cacao nibs
coconut

14. Fermented vegetables
Fermented vegetables like pickles are a great keto snack option.
Research suggests that eating  fermented foods  that contain beneficial bacteria is linked with healthy digestive function and a reduced risk of diabetes and heart disease ( 21 ,  22 ,  23 ).
Fermented vegetables can be purchased or made at home.
You can ferment almost any type of vegetable, including:
cabbage
cucumbers
carrots
cauliflower
beets
green beans
For added fat, pair your fermented veggie snack with herbed full-fat crème fraiche.
It’s important to note that pasteurized pickles or those made with vinegar don’t provide any  live probiotics . Instead, look for pickles sold in the refrigerated section and check the label for words like “fermented,” “raw,” or “probiotic.”

15. Olives
Olives have long been praised for their rich supply of  heart-healthy fats , which is just one reason why they make a great keto snack ( 24 ).
Olives also contain vitamin E,  fiber , and other health promoting plant compounds that may decrease inflammation and reduce the risk of chronic diseases like osteoporosis ( 25 ).
A 3.5-oz (100-g) serving of olives provides roughly 145 calories, 15 g of fat, and 4 g of carbs — almost all of which come from fiber ( 26 ).
You can enjoy them plain or stuff them with feta or gorgonzola cheese to add some extra fat.

16. Fat bombs
“Fat bomb” is a term people on the keto diet coined to describe low carb, dessert-style energy bites that satisfy your sweet tooth.
Fat bombs are often made using  coconut oil , nut butter, avocado, or cream cheese as the base. Other ingredients are added to create delicious flavor profiles.
Dark chocolate and peanut butter is a popular combination, but the possibilities are limitless.
You can purchase these delicious, portable snacks or make them at home.

17. Buffalo cauliflower bites
Try a healthy, vegetarian twist on classic buffalo wings by swapping the chicken for fiber-rich cauliflower.
In addition to fiber,  cauliflower  contains vitamin C and other antioxidants that may reduce inflammation and boost your health ( 27 ,  28 ).
To make these tasty “wings,” toss chopped cauliflower with your favorite buffalo sauce and melted butter. Roast in the oven for 20–25 minutes or use an air fryer.
Serve with carrot sticks and a side of ranch or blue cheese dressing.

18. Flax crackers with cheese
For many keto dieters, crackers are usually off the menu — but they don’t have to be. Ground  flax seeds  are loaded with fiber and omega-3 fats, and they make a great base for keto-friendly crackers ( 29 ).
Pair the crackers with sliced cheese, and you’ve got a healthy and delicious keto snack that requires very little preparation.
You can make flax crackers yourself or skip the baking process and buy a bag instead.

19. Yogurt
Yogurt  is a great source of probiotics, which may support healthy digestive function ( 30 ).
Coconut yogurt has been making waves as a popular dairy-free alternative to traditional yogurt, and some types are also suitable for a ketogenic diet.
Many varieties of full-fat, unsweetened Greek yogurt can also easily fit into a ketogenic diet.

20. Stuffed mushrooms
Mushrooms are low in carbs and provide important nutrients, including  selenium , potassium, vitamin D, and several B vitamins ( 3 ).
For a tasty keto snack, try stuffing button mushroom caps with herbed cream cheese or ground sausage.
For a different twist, turn portobello mushroom caps into mini Margherita pizzas by stuffing them with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil before baking until tender and golden.

21. Meatball sliders
Traditional meatball sandwiches are high in carbs because of the bun. However, you can replace the bun with lettuce to make keto meatball sliders.
Mix your favorite ground meat with eggs,  garlic , herbs, and Parmesan cheese, shape into balls, and bake. These keto-friendly meatballs can be eaten right away or frozen for later.
When you’re ready to dig in, place the meatballs in the lettuce “buns” for a high protein, low carb snack. For an extra dose of fat, serve them with a tomato-garlic aioli for dipping.

22. Dill pickle wraps
If you need an easy snack that’s high in protein, try wrapping dill pickles and  cream cheese  with a slice or two of your choice of deli meat.
Ham, turkey, and roast beef are all low carb, high protein options that can help keep you feeling full between meals ( 31 ,  32 ,  33 ).
Try slicing them into individual roll ups for a simple grab-and-go snack and experiment with other ingredients like green onions, chives, or red peppers to add extra flavor.

23. Raspberries with cottage cheese
Raspberries are relatively low in carbs and can be enjoyed in moderation as part of a ketogenic diet.
In fact, 1/2 cup (61 g) of  raspberries  contains just 7 g of carbs, 4 g of which is fiber ( 34 ).
For a keto-friendly snack, add raspberries to  cottage cheese  to boost your intake of fat and protein ( 35 ).
Depending on your daily carb allotment, you can even mix in your favorite nuts or seeds for an added crunch.

24. Zucchini chips
With just 6 g of carbs in a medium zucchini — 2 g of which are fiber — zucchini chips can be a tasty, low carb alternative to  potato chips  ( 36 ).
Simply toss thinly sliced  zucchini  with olive oil, salt, and pepper and bake for 15–20 minutes or add them to an air fryer and cook until crispy.
If you’re feeling creative, try sprinkling your next batch with other ingredients, such as:
Parmesan cheese
garlic powder
onion powder
smoked paprika

25. Deviled eggs with cream cheese
Traditionally made by combining hard-boiled eggs with  mayonnaise , mustard, vinegar, and a dash of salt and pepper, deviled eggs are a party favorite and a popular keto-friendly snack.
To dial up the flavor and fat content, try mixing a scoop of cream cheese into your next batch.
Each tbsp (15 g) of regular cream cheese contains 5 g of fat, 1 g of protein, and less than 1 g of carbohydrates ( 37 ).

26. Fruit leather
Homemade fruit leather is made by blending your choice of berries, spreading the mixture onto a baking tray, and cooking at a low temperature until it’s completely  dehydrated .
Requiring just one ingredient, this is an easy make-ahead snack that you can whip up and keep in your kitchen.
Be sure to opt for  low carb berries , such as strawberries, raspberries, or blackberries and add a bit of your favorite keto-friendly sweetener if needed ( 34 ,  38 ,  39 ).

27. Cauliflower hummus with veggies
Regular hummus made from chickpeas contains 4.5 g of carbs in each 2-tbsp (30-g) serving ( 40 ).
Though this seems low, most people consume much more than this amount in a single sitting, making it challenging to fit hummus into a ketogenic diet.
Cauliflower hummus is a low carb alternative, which is made by blending roasted  cauliflower  with ingredients like:
tahini
olive oil
lemon juice
spices
Use cauliflower hummus as a dip for celery sticks, carrots, or cucumbers or slather onto homemade roll-ups and enjoy.

28. Stuffed mini bell peppers
In addition to adding a pop of color to your plate, bell peppers are low in carbs and rich in fiber, vitamin C, potassium, and folate ( 41 ).
Stuffed mini  bell peppers  can also be a great savory snack or appetizer.
Slice the peppers in half length-wise, remove the seeds, and fill with a scoop of cream cheese and some seasoning.
Optionally, you can also pop the peppers into the oven, bake for 10–15 minutes, and enjoy hot.

29. Keto granola bars
Most store-bought  granola bars  are relatively high in sugar or carbs, with some varieties packing over 18 g of carbs in a single 1-oz (28-g) bar ( 42 ).
However, making your own granola bars at home can significantly reduce the carb content.
There are many recipes available online, which typically include ingredients like:
chopped nuts
unsweetened  coconut flakes
nut butter
seeds
Most also include sugar alternatives like  monkfruit , which can help add sweetness without increasing the carb content.

30. Tuna cucumber bites
Not only is tuna free of carbs, but it’s also a good source of protein and heart-healthy fats ( 43 ).
You can easily make spicy tuna cucumber bites by mixing  canned tuna  with mayonnaise, green onions, salt, pepper, and a drizzle of hot sauce.
Then, add a spoonful to each cucumber slice and garnish with fresh parsley, dill, or red pepper flakes.

The bottom line
It can be difficult to find keto-friendly snacks that aren’t only tasty but also healthy.
To help you out, this list provides a variety of delicious homemade and store-bought options from which to choose. Try them all — or pick the ones that best fit your tastes and lifestyle.
