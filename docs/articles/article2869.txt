Title: 12 Foods That Are Very High in Omega-3

Many foods have omega-3 fatty acids. A diet high in certain fish, seeds, and nuts can help you get more omega-3s.
Omega-3 fatty acids have various benefits for your body and brain.
Many mainstream health organizations recommend that healthy adults consume 250–500 milligrams (mg) of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) per day. You can reach that amount by eating two servings of fatty fish per week ( 1 ,  2 ).
You can get large amounts of omega-3 fats from fatty fish, algae, and several high fat plant foods.
For alpha-linolenic acid or ALA, a plant-based omega-3, the Adequate Intake is 1,600 mg for people assigned male at birth and 1,100 mg for people assigned female at birth, according to the National Institutes of Health ( 3 ).
Here is a list of 12 foods that are very high in omega-3.

1. Mackerel (4,580 mg per serving)
Mackerel are small fatty  fish .
In many countries, they are commonly smoked and eaten as whole fillets.
Mackerel are incredibly rich in nutrients — a 3.5-ounce (oz), or 100-gram (g), serving packs 500% of the Daily Value (DV) for vitamin B12 and 130% for  selenium  ( 4 ).
What’s more, these fish are delicious and require little preparation.
Omega-3 content:  4,580 mg of EPA and DHA (combined) in 3.5 oz (100 g) ( 4 )

2. Salmon (2,150 mg per serving)
Salmon  is one of the most  nutrient-dense foods  on the planet.
It contains high quality protein and various nutrients, including large amounts of vitamin D, selenium, and B vitamins ( 5 ,  6 ).
Studies show that people who regularly eat fatty fish such as  salmon  have a lower risk of conditions such as heart disease,  dementia , and depression ( 7 ,  8 ,  9 ).
Omega-3 content:  2,150 mg of EPA and DHA (combined) in 3.5 oz (100 g) ( 5 )

3. Cod liver oil (2,438 mg per serving)
Cod liver oil  is more of a supplement than a food.
As the name implies, it’s an oil extracted from the livers of cod fish.
This oil is high in  omega-3 fatty acids  and loaded with vitamins D and A — a single tablespoon provides 170% and 453% of the Daily Value (DV), respectively ( 10 ).
Therefore, taking just 1 tablespoon of  cod liver oil  more than satisfies your need for three essential nutrients.
But don’t take more than 1 tablespoon at a time, as too much vitamin A can be harmful.
Omega-3 content:  2,438 mg of EPA and DHA (combined) per tablespoon ( 10 )

4. Herring (2,150 mg per serving)
Herring is a medium-sized  oily fish . It is often cold-smoked, pickled, or precooked and sold as a canned snack.
Smoked herring is a popular breakfast food in countries such as England, where it’s called kippers and served with  eggs .
A 3.5-oz (100-g) serving of herring contains almost 100% of the DV for selenium and 779% of the DV for vitamin B12 ( 11 ).
Omega-3 content:  2,150 mg of EPA and DHA (combined) in 3.5 oz (100 g) ( 11 )

5. Oysters (329 mg per serving)
Shellfish are among the most nutritious foods you can eat.
Oysters are one of the best food sources for  zinc . Just 6 raw eastern oysters (3 oz or 85 g) pack 289% of the DV for zinc, 69% for  copper , and 567% for vitamin B12 ( 12 ,  13 ).
Oysters  can be eaten as an appetizer, snack, or whole meal. Raw oysters are a delicacy in many countries.
Omega-3 content:  329 mg of EPA and DHA (combined) in 6 raw eastern oysters, or 391 mg per 3.5 oz (100 g) ( 12 )

6. Sardines ( 1,463 mg per serving)
Sardines  are very small oily fish commonly eaten as appetizers, snacks, or delicacies.
They’re highly nutritious, especially when eaten whole. They contain almost every nutrient your body needs.
A 3.5-oz (100-g) serving of drained sardines provides more than 370% of the DV for vitamin B12, 24% for vitamin D, and 96% for selenium ( 14 ).
Omega-3 content:  1,463 mg of EPA and DHA (combined) per cup (149 g) of canned Atlantic sardines, or 982 mg per 3.5 oz (100 g) ( 14 )

7. Anchovies (411 mg per serving)
Anchovies are tiny oily fish that are often sold dried or canned.
Usually eaten in small portions, anchovies can be rolled around  capers , stuffed into  olives , or used as pizza and  salad toppings .
Because of their strong taste, they are also used to flavor many dishes and sauces, including Worcestershire sauce, remoulade, and Caesar dressing.
Anchovies are a great source of  niacin  and selenium, and boned anchovies are a decent source of  calcium  ( 15 ).
Omega-3 content:  411 mg of EPA and DHA (combined) per 5 anchovies (20 g), or 2,053 mg per 3.5 oz (100 g) ( 15 )

8. Caviar (1,046 mg per serving)
Caviar consists of fish eggs, or roe.
Widely regarded as a luxury food item, caviar is most often used in small quantities as an appetizer, taster, or garnish.
Caviar is a good source of  choline  and a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids ( 16 ).
Omega-3 content:  1,046 mg of EPA and DHA (combined) per tablespoon (16 g), or 6,540 mg per 3.5 oz (100 g) ( 16 )

9. Flaxseed (2,350 mg per serving)
These small brown or yellow seeds are often ground, milled, or pressed to extract oil.
They are one of the richest whole food sources of the omega-3 fat alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Therefore,  flaxseed oil  is often used as an omega-3 supplement.
Flaxseed  is also a  good source of fiber ,  magnesium , and other nutrients. The seeds have a great  omega-6 to omega-3 ratio  compared to most other oily plant seeds ( 17 ,  18 ,  19 ,  20 ).
Because your intestines cannot break down the tough outer shells of whole flaxseed, it may be better to use ground flaxseed or grind whole flaxseed in a coffee grinder.
Omega-3 content:  2,350 mg of ALA per tablespoon (10.3 g) of whole seeds, or 7,260 mg per tablespoon (13.6 g) of oil ( 17 ,  18 )

10. Chia seeds (5,050 mg per serving)
Chia seeds  are incredibly nutritious — rich in  manganese , selenium, magnesium, and other nutrients ( 21 ).
A standard 1-oz (28-g) serving of chia seeds contains 5 g of protein, including eight  essential amino acids .
Omega-3 content:  5,050 mg of ALA per oz (28 g) ( 21 )

11. Walnuts (2,570 mg per serving)
Walnuts  are very nutritious and loaded with fiber. They also contain large amounts of copper,  manganese , and vitamin E, as well as important plant compounds ( 22 ).
Make sure not to remove the skin, as it packs most of the walnuts’  phenol  antioxidants, which offer health benefits ( 23 ).
Omega-3 content:  2,570 mg of ALA per oz (28 g), or about 14 walnut halves ( 22 )

12. Soybeans (670 mg per serving)
Soybeans are a good source of  fiber  and vegetable protein.
They are also a good source of other nutrients, including  riboflavin ,  folate , vitamin K, magnesium, and  potassium  ( 24 ).
Soybeans  are very high in omega-6 fatty acids. In the past, researchers suggested that eating too much omega-6 may cause inflammation, but current research suggests that the relationship between omega-6 fatty acids and inflammation may be more complex.
Omega-6 fatty acids may have many health benefits, including lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease ( 25 ).
Omega-3 content:  670 mg of ALA in 1/2 cup (47 g) of dry roasted soybeans, or 1,440 mg in 3.5 oz (100 g) ( 24 )

13. Other foods?
Sections 1–8 discuss foods containing the omega-3 fats EPA and  DHA , which are found in some animal foods, seafood, and algae.
Conversely, sections 9–12 mention foods that provide the omega-3 fat ALA, which can be converted to EPA and DHA. However, this process isn’t very efficient, which is why EPA or DHA supplements are often recommended for vegetarians and vegans ( 26 ,  27 ).
Although not as high in omega-3 as the foods above, many other foods contain decent amounts.
These include:
pasture-raised eggs
omega-3-enriched eggs
meats and dairy products from grass-fed animals
hemp seeds
vegetables such as  spinach , Brussels sprouts, and  purslane

Frequently asked questions
Below are answers to common questions about omega-3s and how to add them to your diet.
Fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, and anchovies are all rich in omega-3 fatty acids. You can also get omega-3s from some nuts and seeds.
Non-animal sources of omega-3 fatty acids include flaxseed, chia seeds, walnuts, soybeans, spinach, and Brussels sprouts. Non-animal sources contain the omega-3 fatty acid ALA, which your body does not use as effectively as EPA and DHA, both of which come from animal-based sources.
Pasture-raised eggs and eggs enriched with omega-3s contain a decent amount of omega-3 fatty acids but not as much as oily fish and oysters ( 28 ).
Avocados are not a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids. Like other non-animal sources of omega-3 fatty acids, avocados contain the omega-3 fatty acid ALA, which your body does not use as effectively as EPA and DHA. These more beneficial types only come from animal-based sources, such as fatty fish.

The bottom line
Many whole foods contain large amounts of omega-3s.
Omega-3s provide numerous  health benefits , such as helping to lower inflammation and reduce heart disease risk.
You may easily meet your omega-3 needs if you typically eat these foods. However, if you don’t eat many of these foods and think you may be lacking in omega-3s, you may want to ask a healthcare professional whether you could benefit from an  omega-3 supplement .
