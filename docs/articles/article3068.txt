Why we love it:  Thanks to its rotating weekly menu of  organic , macro-balanced meals, as well as its keto-specific meal plan that boasts fewer than 10 grams (g) of net carbs per meal, we think Trifecta is the best overall choice for low carb eaters.
The keto menu includes items such as:
Grilled Salmon with Pesto
Turkey Bacon Cheddar Frittatas
Beanless Chicken con Carne
Also, subscribers can use Trifecta’s companion app, which includes access to nutrition professionals and personalized diet and fitness plans.
Healthline writer Rachael Ajmera, MS, RD, tried Trifecta Nutrition meals and said she’d recommend them for people following a specialty diet, such as keto or paleo. She called them “tasty, filling, and nutritious.”
“The foods all arrived frozen and were shipped and packaged well,” she said. “The meals were easy to prepare and maintained their texture for the most part. While most tasted good, a few required additional ingredients, such as spices or veggies.”

Why we love it:  Factor features freshly prepared ready-to-heat meals that are brimming with flavor and texture.
The company offers several meal plans, including various keto options, which contain less than 10% of total calories from carbohydrates.
Here are a few examples of  keto-friendly dishes  on the menu:
Keto Poblano Bowl
Tuscan Tomato Chicken
Creamy Tomato & Herb Ragu
Regardless of which menu you choose, all Factor meals are made using suppliers that adhere to strict standards for animal welfare. Also, all ingredients are non-GMO and free of hormones and antibiotics.
Subscriptions include a complimentary 20-minute consultation with a  registered dietitian .
McGrane called Factor one of her favorite prepared meal delivery services “thanks to the flavor and nutritional quality of the meals.”
She commented, “I’ve tried the service twice now, and each time the meals arrived in good condition and were easy to stack in my fridge.
“Factor’s ingredients maintained a great consistency after reheating. I was particularly impressed by how juicy and perfectly cooked the chicken and fish were.
“Finally, all of the meals were well seasoned and featured delicious sauces that helped the meals stand out above competitors.”

Why we love it:  CookUnity’s rotating menu features a variety of global cuisines and seasonal dishes, making it a great choice for those interested in adding more flavorful recipes to their weekly routine.
McGrane said, “CookUnity stands out for its restaurant-worthy flavors. In fact, my husband thought I had ordered takeout.”
The service is also unique in that the meal options vary by location and are designed by chefs in your area. McGrane liked this feature, commenting, “I loved that the meal options vary by location and feature local, seasonal ingredients. I also enjoyed being able to learn more about the chefs that crafted each meal.”
CookUnity offers options suitable for a wide range of dietary restrictions and allows you to filter the menu to find meals that are vegan, vegetarian, keto, or paleo, low in calories, carbs, or sodium, or free of dairy or gluten.
Though availability can vary depending on your specific delivery area, examples of dishes on the menu include:
Baked Herb Cod with Asparagus and Peppers
Pan Seared Chicken with Quinoa
Keto Shepherd’s Pie with Beef
According to McGrane, “The biggest downsides were the clunky sign-up and meal selection processes. Many of the meals were also quite high in calories, which may be a deal-breaker for some people.”
Also, keep in mind that while CookUnity caters to a wide range of diet patterns, the meals are produced in a facility that also processes major allergens. For this reason, it might not be suitable for people with severe food allergies.

Meal type   meal kit
Why we love it:  Home Chef features a rotating menu of meal kits, oven- and grill-ready dishes, and entree salads that require little to no preparation.
Though it doesn’t offer a low carb-specific meal plan, Home Chef features a Carb-Conscious label for recipes that contain fewer than 35 g of carbs per serving.
They also offer meal kits labeled Keto-Friendly. These have no more than 15 g of net carbs per serving.  Net carbs  are calculated by subtracting the grams of  fiber  from the total grams of  carbs .
Examples of Carb-Conscious meals include:
Spicy Chicken Parmesan with Crispy Zucchini
Sweet Chili Ginger Pork and Broccoli Stir-Fry
Creole-Style Fish Cakes with Chipotle Crema and Corn Succotash
Some recipes use organic ingredients, though this varies based on availability. Many menu items can be customized, allowing you to swap in different sources of protein based on your preferences.
Healthline writer SaVanna Shoemaker, MS, RDN, LD, who tried Home Chef, said she had a good experience with the service.
“The ingredients arrive packaged by recipe in plastic bags, which is really convenient when you’re getting ready to cook dinner,” she said.
It’s worth noting that while the ingredients are grouped in plastic bags, much of the rest of the packaging can be  recycled or reused , ranking them high in our sustainability score.
Shoemaker added, “The meals were both really tasty and came together very easily, with helpful and straightforward recipe cards. I liked that the meals were simple, with sauces that added lots of flavor.
“They also offer a lot of add-on salads and sides to stretch the meals further.”

Why we love it:   Green Chef  offers organic meal kits that are nutritious and easy to prepare.
The weekly menu includes 30 recipes, at least 10 of which are keto-specific.
Items on Green Chef’s Keto menu contain around 15 to 20 g of net carbs per serving. Some examples of keto-friendly recipes include:
Chicken con Queso
Seared Cheese with Gremolata
Creamy Paprika Shrimp
Most recipes take only 30 minutes to prepare, and all orders include pre-measured ingredients and recipe cards with detailed instructions. Some ingredients are pre-shredded or chopped, and all are grouped in paper bags, a feature that McGrane liked.
“It helps keep your fridge organized and saves you time. While there was certainly a lot of plastic, I appreciated that each item included a note at the bottom on how to recycle it.
“The Bulgogi Noodle Bowls was by far my favorite dish as the noodles had a wonderfully chewy texture, and the flavors were spot-on. However, the other two dishes were also very flavorful and packed with fresh ingredients and vegetables.
“While some of the ingredient proportions were a bit off, and the timing of some of the steps could’ve been better, I overall think this is one of the best meal delivery services thanks to the quality ingredients and flavorful dishes,” McGrane said.

Why we love it:  Sunbasket is our favorite  meal delivery service for people with diabetes , thanks to its high quality ingredients, creative flavor combinations, and dedicated Diabetes-Friendly meal plan.
The service also offers a Carb-Conscious plan with meals that include at least 10 g of protein and fewer than 35 g of net carbs per serving.
Examples of Carb-Conscious dishes include:
Seared Wild Sea Scallops with Chard, Pancetta, and Lemony Gremolata
Steaks with Roasted Root Vegetable Succotash and Chipotle Mayo
You can also filter the menu for other dietary preferences, such as high fiber, high protein, and low sodium, and select any specific ingredients you’d like to avoid.
Healthline Nutrition Editor Kelli McGrane, MS, RD, who has tried more than 20 meal delivery services, noted Sunbasket as one of her favorites.
“While the recipe booklets can be a bit more difficult to use than the large recipe cards that other services provide, the meals are generally easy to prepare and feature ingredient and flavor combinations that I wouldn’t typically make on my own,” she said.
“It also boasts some of the freshest ingredients, especially proteins. In fact, it’s one of the only services that I’ll order fish or seafood entrees from.”

Why we love it:  The Good Kitchen offers fully prepared meals that feature seasonal, sustainably sourced ingredients.
It has low carb meals, which include fewer than 30 g of total carbs. It also offers keto meals, which contain fewer than 15 g of net carbs.
Examples of keto items include:
Beef Shepherd’s Pie
Ranchero Chicken, Eggs, and “Grits”
Lemon Basil Chicken with Corn & Lentil Fricassee
Healthline editor Kristin Currin-Sheehan tried The Good Kitchen for a week and says she’d recommend it. She cautions that some of the food seemed underseasoned to her, saying that she needed to add salt and that even food labeled “spicy” wasn’t spicy.
Still, she notes that this could be a benefit for those who prefer to adjust seasonings to taste.
“If you enjoy textures, get annoyed at rubbery vegetables, and want to be free to season your food to taste, [The Good Kitchen] is an excellent choice,” she says.

The service also uses antibiotic-free meat and poultry, certified humane eggs, wild-caught shrimp and cod, and open-ocean, farm-raised salmon.
During testing, Healthline writer Lauren Manaker, MS, RDN, LD, CLEC, found the meals to be flavorful and easy to reheat, though she noted that “some were a bit too spicy for [my] taste.”
She commented, “Snap Kitchen is a good fit for people who live busy lifestyles. Those following low carb diets and people focused on weight loss would likely benefit from these meals, too.”

Honorable mention
Meal type   prepared meals
Price per serving   $9.71–$15.20
Diet-to-Go provides fresh, nutritionally balanced meals that are prepared and individually portioned for your convenience.
There are five menus to choose from, including a  diabetes-friendly  meal plan, which is calorie-controlled and low in sodium, and a keto-friendly menu that provides fewer than 30 g of net carbs per day on average.
It provides limited options for vegan, paleo, or gluten-free diets.
Here are a few examples of low carb meals on the menu:
Beef Casserole
Grilled Pork Chop
Lemon Herb Tilapia
Currin-Sheehan tried Diet-to-Go and had mixed feelings.
“For someone who cooks most meals, I wasn’t thrilled about microwaving every meal, the texture of the cut vegetables, and the over-peppering and under-flavoring of the vegetables.
“I was most surprised, however, on the phenomenal texture and flavoring on the collard greens under the Herbed Tilapia! It tasted like home-cooked Southern greens, and it was hard to believe no turkey leg or ham hock was used in the flavoring.”
Currin-Sheehan also noted that in addition to being underwhelmed by the taste and texture of several dishes, several ingredient substitutions she requested weren’t honored.

Low carb diet 101
Low carb diets involve limiting your intake of foods high in  carbohydrates , including certain types of grains, desserts, sugar-sweetened beverages, fruits, and  starchy vegetables .
Not every low carb diet looks the same. There are  several variations  of the low carb diet, which differ in terms of the number of carbs permitted each day.
Generally, a  low carb diet  involves eating less than 26% of total daily calories from carbohydrates or fewer than 130 g of carbs per day. However, very low carb and  ketogenic diets  may limit carb consumption to just 20 to 50 g per day, or fewer than 10% of total daily calories.

How to choose the best low carb meal delivery service
Because few meal delivery services are geared exclusively toward low carb diets, consider the following factors before subscribing:
Diet compatibility:  Look for a service that caters to your dietary preferences when it comes to how many carbs are in a meal.
Menu options:  Make sure to choose a service with enough menu options that fit your dietary needs and preferences. While some companies offer low carb or keto-specific meal plans with multiple recipes per week, others may only feature 1 or 2 low carb options.
Types of meals provided:  Some services offer fully prepared meals, while others provide meal kits that require varying amounts of cooking. Consider how much prep you want to do, if any, before you decide.
Price:  It’s important to keep your budget in mind, as well as additional costs such as shipping.
