The keto diet is a high fat, moderate protein, low carb diet. Most people following keto limit their carb intake to no more than 25 grams (g) of net carbs per day. The goal is to enter a metabolic state called  ketosis , where your body is  burning ketones from fat  as its primary fuel source rather than glucose (sugar) from carbs.
If you eat keto and want to add variety to your meal planning, meal delivery services with keto menus can make following this low carb, high protein, high fat diet easier.
After testing more than 30 meal delivery services, we found that when it comes to taste, nutritional quality, delivery, and value, a handful of services offering keto meals delivered to your door stand out.
Read on to learn about the best keto meal delivery options and how to find the right one for you.

How we chose the best keto meal delivery
To assemble this list of the best keto meal delivery services, we looked for services that are entirely keto-friendly and those with dedicated keto-friendly meal plans or filters. We also considered:
Cost:  This includes the cost of the service’s meal servings plus shipping and delivery prices.
Customization:  This takes into account whether the service accommodates different lifestyles and dietary needs to provide variety and flexibility.
Ingredient quality:  This includes where the company sources ingredients and the quality of those ingredients.
Nutritional information:  We checked whether nutrition labels comply with the keto diet. We also prioritized services that feature healthy fats, plenty of nonstarchy vegetables, and minimally processed ingredients.
Quality and safety standards:  We considered whether each service uses trusted shippers to handle food products, is compliant with food safety and manufacturing regulations set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and lists ingredients, allergens, and nutrition facts on a website or product packaging.
Vetting:  We have vetted the services on our list to ensure they align with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being. You can learn more about  our vetting process .
Personal experience:  We’ve  tested  most of these services ourselves and have included our feedback on how we felt about the ingredient quality, flavors, delivery, and more.

We love Sunbasket’s focus on fresh ingredients, including certified organic produce and unique, easy-to-prepare recipes with bold flavors, such as Chicken Breasts with Olive-Leek Sauce and Sautéed Kale.
Sunbasket’s keto-friendly meals contain at least 20 g of protein and 15 g of net carbs or fewer per serving, and all recipes prioritize healthy fats, such as avocados, nuts, and seeds, as well as high quality proteins.
The service also offers some single serving, microwavable Fresh & Ready meals.
“After trying more than 25 meal delivery services, Sunbasket is my favorite for meal kits because of its high quality ingredients and creative flavor combinations,” said  Kelli McGrane , MS, RD.
“The ordering process at Sunbasket is easy to follow, and I appreciate how easy it is to find recipes that suit my dietary preferences. The meals arrive on time and in good condition. In fact, I thought the packaging and quality of the meat and seafood was the best out of all of the meal kits I’ve tried.
“While it isn’t cheap, I think Sunbasket is worth the cost if you value organic ingredients.”
However, our second tester, Ren Dias, found it difficult to find keto-friendly meals, although they did enjoy the meals they received. They found the recipes and instructions easy to follow, and their delivery arrived right on time.
“I ended up ordering non-keto-friendly meals, as  I was given 11 options, but only one was keto-friendly.  Looking back at [my order], there was only one keto-friendly meal available that was also low in sodium and added sugar. Because Sunbasket touts itself as organic, responsibly sourced, quality ingredients, I didn’t expect the low sodium or low added sugar preferences to interfere with the number of meals available.
“However, they only cook about 18 meals per week, so it makes sense that they might not have many meals to meet each of their available diets. They offer eight diets, so even with meals eligible for multiple diets, you’re looking at  maybe  two or three meals per week tops that could meet your needs.”
Read Ren’s review of the meals they tried below, and see what we think of Sunbasket overall in our  brand review .
Chicken and Gnocchi “Dumplings” with Seasoned Vegetables
“This was the prepared meal.  The serving size was bigger than it let on. It looked small but was actually quite filling.  It came with a note that it was “minimally seasoned” and that you “might want to add salt and pepper to taste.”  I added garlic powder, onion powder, and red pepper flakes — common spices in my cooking.  The taste was still a little bland, but better than other prepared meals I’ve had before.  The texture was a little offputting. It was like it had been cooked in a pressure cooker or overcooked, where everything was mushy (another reason why I’m not certain it was “never frozen”).”
Spiced Pakistani Beef Keema with Potatoes, Green Beans, and Tomatoes
“This was a meal kit.  Similar to the prepared meal, the serving sizes were bigger than it let on. I was pleasantly surprised with how many leftovers we had!  I did not add any additional seasonings or ingredients and was happy with the result.  It was mildly spicy — enough that it was noticeable, but my toddler was still able to eat it happily.  It smelled and tasted great!  The only downside for me was that it took way too long to prep the ingredients, so the overall cooking time took over an hour.”
Sweet Potato and Black Bean Chilli with Avocado
“This was a meal kit.  Again, I loved the serving size here! I was able to freeze some leftovers.  I will say, though, that two whole onions were way too much. I only used one, then chopped the other and froze it for later use.  I didn’t add any additional seasonings or ingredients and was happy with the result, but my husband said it could’ve used more spice and some cheese.  This one took much less time to prep, and it was all cooked in one pot.  It was made within the time estimate (25 to 35 mins, I believe).
“For me, the biggest downside was the low visibility into which meal options fit my dietary preferences. I assumed all meals that were available to choose from were applicable. However, only the “Picked For You” meals were applicable to my needs. This could potentially lead to people getting meals that aren’t safe or appropriate for them.”

Factor gets our vote for best prepared keto meals for the quality of its ingredients, ease of preparation, large selection, delicious flavors, and freshness.
Each week, customers can choose from at least 15 keto-friendly entrees, plus a wide variety of add-ons, including side dishes, shakes, breakfast, and desserts.
All Factor keto meals are delivered fully prepared and ready to enjoy in a matter of minutes.
It’s a favorite of McGrane’s. “Of all the prepared meal delivery services I’ve tried, Factor is my overall favorite,” she said. “I’ve tested the service several times, and I’ve never had an issue finding meals that sound appealing.
“I find the meals to be flavorful without being overseasoned, and I love that each meal has a generous serving of vegetables.
“I particularly love the flavor combinations and quality of the proteins — even the salmon tasted fresh and wasn’t at all fishy. Plus, unlike many  prepared meals , the vegetables are soft without being mushy.”
Our second tester, Kelsey Regan, also enjoyed the variety Factor offered, saying “ Factor’s keto menu offered a great variety of ingredient types, flavor combinations, and menu offerings. I noticed a balance of proteins, from chicken to fish to beef, so you aren’t stuck with the same ingredients each meal. They also use a variety of vegetables, from cauliflower to zucchini to carrots, along with keto-friendlt sauces and sources to keep things flavorful.
“I’ve tried a few other meal delivery services, including HelloFresh and Blue Apron. Those meal delivery services focus on cooking and preparation. While they offer a variety of recipes, they do involve more time and effort to prepare compared to Factor’s fully-prepared meals.
“After trying Factor’s meals, I do feel that they are worth the price, especially for someone who is looking specifically for convenience, quality, and a variety of healthy options. The time-saving aspect in itself was a key highlight for me, as time is money!”
Read about what Kelsey thought of Factor’s meals below.
“While I don’t follow a strict keto diet on a daily basis, I do occasionally gravitate toward lower-carb, high protein options. Factor’s keto meal plan impressed me with its wide variety of options compared to other meal delivery services that tend to have limited or repetitive selections. There were plenty of meal choices to select from.”
Spinach & Mushroom Chicken Thighs
It was just enough for a single meal but not feeling overly full. The spinach and mushroom combination were a nice compliment to the thighs, which were well seasoned.  The thighs were tender and the mushrooms were on the softer side.
Roasted Red Pepper Tortellini & Italian Sausage
This dish was one of my favorites. The roasted red pepper sauce had a smoky-sweet flavor, and the Italian sausage added the right amount of spice.  The tortellini was well cooked and the sausage complimented the pasta well.
The portion felt slightly smaller compared to other meals, likely because the entire portions focus was the pasta and there were no additional sides.
Truffle Butter Filet Mignon
The steak was cooked medium-well, but still was tender. Cooking steak to a perfect temperature is challenging to do via meal delivery. The truffle butter was an added luxury to the filet. I love truffle, so this was a great flavor addition.  This, with the accompany of the cooked carrots, were enough for a single portion.
Parmesan & Sun-Dried Tomatoe Chicken Penne
The sun dried tomatoes paired nicely with the creamy parmesan sauce.  The penne was on the al dente side, and the chicken was cut into smaller portions. The side of green beans were cooked well, but the added garlic gloves were slightly overwhelming to the side itself.  This was on the smaller, lighter side, for a pasta dish.

Green Chef earns our pick as best  meal kit  for its dedicated keto-friendly menu, with 8 to 10 easy-to-prepare entrees to choose from each week.
It’s also a certified  organic  company, so most ingredients are organic. Additionally, all the ingredients used in the keto meal plan are certified gluten-free.
And Green Chef is family-friendly, giving you the option to receive keto meal kits that feed two, four, or six adults.
“I’ve tried Green Chef several times, and the service consistently provides flavorful recipes with high quality ingredients,” said McGrane.
“To make mealtime easier, many of the ingredients arrived pre-chopped or pre-measured, and none of the recipes took longer than the estimated time to prepare. I also liked that the recipes were creative and different than what I’d typically cook.”
Our second tester, Jacob Moore, said that “ Green Chef offered a lot of different types of foods, protein options, and cuisines. My wife and I chose a Mediterranean option, an Italian option, and Latin option.” He went on to say that while Green Chef’s instructions were clear and easy to follow, they took slightly longer than the 30 minutes stated on the recipes as a “beginner to intermediate level chef.”
Read Jacob’s full review of the meals he tried below, and learn more about the brand in our  Green Chef review .
“I do not typically follow a keto diet, nor was I following a strict keto diet while trying out Green Chef’s options. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the number of options that Green Chef provides and how everything tasted.
“The recipes I made required multiple pots and pans, but it was usually only two or three items, so cleaning up was still easy. The most specialized piece of equipment that was required but not included is a meat thermometer.
“Quality and convenience were great, but the trade-off was that the packaging is pretty unsustainable. Items are individually packaged to ensure the quality of the food, but this means that there is a lot of packaging to throw away at the end of each meal.
“We tried three of the meals: Salmon Bulgur Bowl with Turmeric Carrots, the Ancho Chicken Soup, and The Italian-Style Surf’n’Turf. All of them were delicious.”
Salmon Bulgur Bowl “[This dish] was filling with plenty of protein, but it still felt light.  This was one of my overall favorites and one that I could eat multiple times per week. The seasoning was perfect, and portions were reasonable.”
Ancho Chicken Soup
“The Ancho Chicken Soup was similar to the Salmon dish in that I could eat it multiple times per week. The meal felt light and refreshing, especially with the fresh tomatoes and cilantro. This was the only meal that I felt the serving size was a little bit small.”
Italian-Style Surf’n’Turf
“The Italian-Style Surf’n’Turf was great for a date night! We added some extra butter while cooking in order to add a bit of flavor. Portion size on this dish was especially generous. I really enjoyed the steak and shrimp and the cream sauce was delicious. In an ideal world, I would have liked to add a starch. Something like cauliflower rice could work for keto.
“At approximately $13.50 per meal, I think the price per meal is a bit steep. It’s fun to make these, but if I was going to budget that much per meal, I would opt for the convenience of eating out. However, if you want to cook at home more or don’t have convenient access to good fast-casual spots, this could be worth it.”

Meal type   prepared meals and a la carte items
Trifecta is a prepared foods meal service  designed to support  individual health and nutrition goals with four meal plans: Keto, Paleo, Whole30, Clean, and Plant-Based (vegan).
Its keto-friendly meals contain no more than 10 g of net carbs per meal. You can choose to receive 5, 7, 10, or 14 entrees per week. There’s also an option to add seven breakfasts to your weekly delivery and an à la carte option, which allows you to purchase individually prepared ingredients to build your own meals.
All meals are nutritionally balanced and feature high quality ingredients, earning it our pick as the best keto meal delivery for weight loss and fitness.
Unlike some other services, Trifecta recommends heating its meals on a stovetop, though some selections can be heated in an air fryer, oven, or microwave.
Rachael Ajmera , MS, RD, found Trifecta meals satisfying that hit all the right nutrition marks. “[The] meals were tasty, filling, and nutritious,” she said.
She noted that Trifecta recommend reheating meals on the stove, instead of using the microwave, something that helped maintain their texture. However, she found that a few required additional ingredients, such as spices or veggies, to make them more palatable.
“I think it is a good fit for people following certain diet patterns, including keto,” she said. “You can also choose your own meals or opt for a pre-selected menu with up to one ingredient excluded, making it a good option for picky eaters as well.”
We also had regular Healthline product tester Taylor Morelli try out the keto-specific menu. They tried seven meals for the week and found that while they offered a good level of variety, there was room for more.
“Overall, the portions seemed a little small in relation to the calorie counts, and I found myself needing a little snack afterward. The meals were all vacuum sealed which was easy to just toss in the microwave, although three of my meals had a plastic cup of guacamole under the film that I needed to remove prior to heating but this wasn’t mentioned in the instructions.”
They appreciated Trifecta’s packaging, saying that “t here didn’t seem to be an abundance of packaging, and I like how it included recyclable insulation and eco-friendly gel packs that can apparently be used as plant food!”
See what Taylor thought of the keto-friendly meals they received below, and  read our full review of Trifecta Nutrition .
Buffalo Chicken Pasta
“The chicken was a little dry here and I didn’t love the texture of the lupin pasta, but that’s probably more of a keto substitute issue than preparation.”
Teriyaki Chicken
“The chicken texture was much better than the buffalo chicken (seemed to be chicken thighs), but I didn’t love the addition of walnuts, almonds, and sesame seeds. I know keto is higher fat, but it felt like there were other options they could’ve included that were more fitting for the dish.”
Romesco Steak, Veggies with Guac
“The steak was a little chewy on this one but overall, this was my favorite of all the meals.”
Ground Beef BBQ with Mac N Cheese
“I did not like this meal at all. The BBQ beef tasted more like taco seasoning, and I didn’t taste any cheese at all in the ‘mac n cheese’.”
Brisket Burrito with Guacamole
“[This meal was] definitely on the smaller size and needed a little something extra in the burrito, like cheese and salsa. But the guacamole cup was a great addition. It also got a little soggy on the bottom as the juice from the meat seeped out during reheating.”

Best for families
Meal type   Meal kit
While HelloFresh doesn’t offer dedicated keto entrees, you can easily adapt many of the meals to fit a keto lifestyle. For this reason, it earns our vote as best for families, especially where one or more people eat keto, but others don’t.
SaVanna Shoemaker , MS, RDN, was impressed by how easy it was to choose keto-friendly substitutions.
“You can easily remove the carb source or replace it with a more keto-friendly one, such as cauliflower mash or zucchini noodles. The service also allows you to make ingredient substitutions, such as asparagus instead of potatoes for a side.
“I have done this myself with great success,” she said. “I eat a  keto diet , but my husband and children do not. If you choose this approach, try to avoid meals with sugary sauces, such as glazes, which can be more difficult to substitute on keto.”
Candice Abellon  has used HelloFresh off and on for a few years.  “I think it’s a great option for families and single people,” she said. “It’s definitely cheaper than eating out and in many ways more convenient than making a trip to a grocery store and the attention it takes to think of recipes and source the ingredients.”
She also likes how user-friendly it is. “The cooking instructions are pretty clear and easy to follow, which can make it easier to trade off cooking responsibilities for some meals regardless of the kitchen abilities of everyone in the household.”
McGrane recommends HelloFresh to people new to keto meal kits: “It’s relatively affordable, offers a good variety of meals to choose from, and the recipes are mostly beginner-friendly.”

The Good Kitchen specializes in fully prepared meals made by local chefs. The menu includes a range of keto-friendly options, which contain fewer than 15 g of net carbs per serving.
Each week, you can order 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 fresh meals per delivery and filter the menu to find options free of certain ingredients, specific meal types, or items that provide a set calorie or sodium range per serving.
Because The Good Kitchen uses regional and local chefs, the available meals can vary depending on your location. However, the menu generally provides at least five keto-friendly options each week.
Good Kitchen also uses some organic ingredients, and all meals are free of preservatives, refined oils, sugars, nitrates, and artificial colors or flavors.
Our tester, Emma McElroy, tried the keto menu as they have been interested in trying a keto diet. They reported that “w hen looking at The Good Kitchen’s menu, there were a decent amount of options for keto meals! I really liked how they had a description at the top of the Keto Friendly tab explaining why they identified these meals as keto-friendly.”
Emma appreciated the filtering options to help narrow down choices for the week,  which meant “you can exclude any ingredients you want to avoid and you can sort the meals by amount of protein, carbs, calories, etc. It was nice that I could look at the keto-friendly meals and also add these filters on top of them .”
However, they went on to say that, “ I think there was a good variety of flavor combinations offered, but the variety of ingredients wasn’t the best. The majority of the meals offered chicken as the protein, either cauliflower rice or cauliflower mash as the main side, and green beans as the vegetable. They were able to change up the flavors by adding different sauces or spices, but there was not a wide variety of the main ingredients. “
Plus, it wasn’t clear if any Trifecta packaging was recyclable.
Learn about what Emma thought of their Trifecta meals below.
“Overall, these meals tasted pretty good! One thing that I prefer about meals I cook myself is that I can control my own level of seasoning/spice. I’m really sensitive to spicy food, and some of these meals were spicier than I would have liked. I specifically didn’t choose any of the meals that the website indicated were spicy, but I still felt like the Seasoned Ground Chicken was way spicier than I had expected. If you’re sensitive to spices, I would check the ingredients for things like jalapeño pepper or red pepper flakes before picking that meal.”
Lemon Dill Chicken
“The Lemon Dill Chicken was my favorite out of all the meals! The chicken tasted good and had a nice texture. I also really enjoyed the cauliflower mash. The cauliflower mash was a little thinner than traditional mashed potatoes but it tasted really good. The garlic spinach that came with this meal was a little soggy after being heated up, but still tasted very good. I also enjoyed the sauce that came with this meal — it provided a delicious dill taste that brought the whole meal together.”
Beef Stew
“Overall, the beef stew was pretty good! When it came out of the microwave, it smelled delicious, and I was really excited to try it. The one flaw of this meal is that it had way too much pepper for my personal preference. I felt like the real flavor of this meal was being masked by all of the pepper. The beef stew also came with cauliflower mash, which I enjoyed.”
Lemon Garlic Chicken
“The Lemon Garlic Chicken was good, but I wish they had made the vegetable selection more clear on the menu. The menu said it comes with “ peppers, onions and grape tomatoes,” but the majority of the vegetables were peppers. I don’t mind peppers, but I would’ve preferred if there was a more even mix of these vegetables. This was the only meal where I felt like the chicken had a texture that was slightly off. It wasn’t completely off-putting, but I definitely noticed that there was something different about it.”
Seasoned Ground Chicken Stir-Fry
“When I looked at the Chicken Stir-Fry on the menu, I didn’t notice anything that indicated that this meal would be particularly spicy. However, I was only able to eat about half of the meal before I had to give up because it was too spicy. I know I am very sensitive to spice, but I think most people would agree that this meal at least had a little kick to it. I wasn’t able to get a good idea of the taste of this meal because it was too spicy for me.
“Overall, the biggest pro of these meals was the convenience and healthiness. I often struggle to cook healthy meals for myself, so this was a great alternative option to many of the meals I make. One thing that I noticed was that after eating each meal, I was still hungry. Since all these meals were between 350 and 450 calories, I did not find them very filling and had to supplement them with additional snacks afterward. These meals would be best for a lunch, as I didn’t find them filling enough for a dinner.”

Provenance Meals is a New York City-based service that offers healthy prepared meals that are fresh and ready to eat. They’re delivered to your door throughout the contiguous United States. The company was founded in 2012 by holistic health coach and entrepreneur Caroll Lee, and is currently owned and operated by women.
Provenance Meals has a keto-friendly menu, with most meals containing less than 15 g net carbs, plenty of nonstarchy veggies, and moderate amounts of healthy fats and protein. Provenance also offers low carb, paleo, vegetarian, and vegan menus.
Meals are designed to require no cooking, just reheating in the microwave from 90 to 120 seconds.
The service values high quality, sustainable ingredients. Many meals include locally sourced organic produce, along with grass-fed beef and sustainably sourced seafood. All meals are free of gluten, dairy, and refined sugar.
You pick the meals you want from the online menu and then make either a single or repeating order from the rotating menu. The system is designed for twice-weekly deliveries, but you can pick single deliveries to suit your schedule.
A subscription is available but not required. In addition to individual meals, Provenance offers a:
2-day cleanse
6-day cleanse
weekly meal program
2-day chef’s tasting program
The website’s nutritional info and search filter options are extensive enough to satisfy even the most meticulous keto nutrition tracker. First, you can filter meals to include only those that are keto friendly. For each meal, the website discloses all ingredients, total nutrition info, and macronutrient ratios.
Then you can filter further by:
meal type
ingredients to avoid
protein sourcing
shelf life
nutrition info
You can also set the number of calories, total fat, sodium, sugar, total carbs, and protein you want in your meals.
Most menu items provide 1 serving, but there are some family-style options for multiple servings. A bundle of two packets of shelf-stable, long-simmered bone broth is also available.
Local chefs across the country prepare the meals through a partnership with Mealogic, a personalized nutrition and production company. Delivery packaging is recyclable cardboard made from renewed fiber. Each order contains instructions for how to dispose of meal containers, insulated liners, and ice packs.
Our tester, Siobhan DeRemer, appreciated the variety of proteins available in Provenance’s keto-friendly meals, but overall, the meal options were limited.
“I ordered about a week’s worth of meals and then revisited the site, and it’s still the same selection, so if I wanted to plan for this each week, I’d have the same choices. I appreciated the option for cooked and seasoned protein only, but the pricing was prohibitive (2 servings of chicken breast is $16).”
However, Siobhan felt that  “most of these would work best as lunch portions. Of course, this depends on someone’s preference, but I’d likely want a bit more for a dinner portion. I could see these being fine if someone eats smaller meals or is managing calories/portions, but even if you had two of these meals in a day (one for lunch, one for dinner), many wouldn’t equal 1,000 calories combined.”
Siobhan felt “the overall quality and taste of these prepared meals was high” and said that “the freshness and quality shined.”
Learn more about their experience and the meals they tried below.
Lemon Garlic Chicken and Vegetables
“I’m not a huge chicken thigh fan, but the texture here wasn’t bad. Portion size was decent, especially if used as a lunch option. I didn’t add seasonings/ingredients as the sauce was flavorful (and there was a good amount of it), though the chicken was a bit bland. I appreciated that the suggested heating time didn’t overcook the vegetables; the beans and peppers/onions were a good texture, though not super pretty. Overall, a filling and flavorful meal.”
Beef Stew with Rosemary Cauliflower Mash & Roasted Carrots
“This was surprisingly good. It isn’t winning any photogenic awards, but the texture of the beef, carrots, and mash was exactly what I’d expect, and the quality of the beef was better than I expected. I was also so happy with the seasoning. I grabbed my salt grinder preemptively for the cauliflower mash and found I didn’t need it at all. It was a bit heavy on the black pepper, so for some who may be sensitive to that, fair warning, but I enjoyed that it was flavorful straight from the package. The portion was also good as beef and mash tend to be heavier, but again may not be great as a dinner serving. As far as portion/quality to cost, this was a bit hefty at $16, but I do think the quality of the ingredients helps justify that investment.”
Arrabbiata Sausage and Peppers with Sauteed Zucchini
“This was a tasty one as well. I liked that the sausage was crumbled, making it a bit easier to heat and eat. I wouldn’t necessarily call this spicy, maybe more like mild, but the seasoning was good. If eating the zucchini side not mixed with the rest of the meal, it benefits from a bit of salt, but once again, I was impressed with the spice level of this meal.”
Turkey Taco Bowl
“Not beautiful, but yummy (definitely did not look like the picture on the website)! Needed a fair amount of seasoning (salt, hot sauce) but overall a tasty dish. Unfortunately, the sauce cup had cracked, so some of the sauce had baked into the meal, but was still a welcome addition. Texture was on point, and ingredients were fresh, even a week after arrival.”
Lemon Dill Chicken
“Likely my favorite of the bunch. Thankful this one was chicken breast so I could enjoy it. Mash needed a little salt, but the dill sauce was flavorful and added a good zing. The quality of the protein was great and not dry. Texture of all the items was spot on. I enjoyed that the spinach wasn’t overly garlicky and it wasn’t mush after heating it for 3 minutes in the microwave.”
Brodo Chicken Bone Broth
“Grabbed this as an add-on item to make six choices for delivery (since there were only five meals to choose from that are keto-friendly). I enjoy bone broth to sip, especially when it’s getting colder outside, and this one was good. I’ve always found bone broths to be bland but this one still had decent flavor. It’s THICK when you first pour it from the pouch to heat it, which wasn’t my favorite, but it does speak to the quality of the broth. It’s clearly meant for sipping since 1 serving is only a cup, but I heated them both and added some veggies for lunch. This brand isn’t proprietary to Provenance, so I searched for them online and found a larger variety of flavors that I may consider purchasing now that I’ve tried this one!”

Keto meal delivery services compared

How to choose a keto meal delivery service
Is it keto-friendly?  The most important consideration when choosing a keto meal delivery service is whether it offers keto-friendly options. Many meal delivery services offer paleo or  low carb options , but these are not necessarily low enough in carbs to suit a  keto diet .
How many keto options are available?  While some services offer a dedicated keto menu with several options to choose from, others simply offer a few keto recipes each week. Which one to choose depends on how important variety is to you. You’ll also want to choose whether you want fully prepared meals or delivery kits where you assemble and cook the meal.
Does it fit your budget?  It’s important to find a service available in your area that suits your budget. These services range drastically in price, from $9 per serving to $15 or more per serving. Make sure to factor in shipping costs as well.
Does it require a subscription?  If you need flexibility, consider choosing a service that doesn’t require a subscription.
Does it accommodate other dietary or ingredient preferences?  Check whether the service can accommodate your dietary preferences and whether the ingredient quality is up to your standards. Many options on our list use high quality meats and some organic produce.
