Title: The 20/20 Diet: A Comprehensive Review

The 20/20 diet is a weight loss diet created by television star Dr. Phil prioritizing 20 “power foods” along with psychological tips claimed to help you lose weight quickly.
Despite Dr. Phil’s long run as a celebrity, you may wonder if a former psychologist has the secret to weight loss and whether this diet is something you should try.
This article tells you all you need to know about the 20/20 diet, including whether it helps with weight loss, its benefits and downsides, and instructions on following it.

What is the 20/20 diet plan?
In 2015, Dr. Phil McGraw — better known as Dr. Phil — released a book,  “The 20/20 Diet: Turn Your Weight Loss Vision Into Reality,”  to help struggling dieters achieve successful weight loss.
Dr. Phil has a PhD in clinical psychology and has hosted the daytime television show “Dr. Phil” since 2002.
The 20/20 diet is based on the  thermic effect of food (TEF) , which is the  number of calories your body uses  to digest, absorb, and utilize nutrients from food.
According to the book, 20 “power foods” require a lot of energy (calories) to process. So, the more calories you burn from eating these foods, the fewer net calories your body ends up taking in.
The diet includes four phases that gradually reintroduce foods restricted in the earlier phases. Along with this, it encourages various psychological tricks to  prevent overeating , such as brushing your teeth when you’re hungry.
Collectively, the long list of food restrictions paired with psychology tips and regular exercise is believed to help you lose weight.
Created by Dr. Phil McGraw, the 20/20 diet is a four-phase diet that emphasizes eating from a list of 20 power foods believed to encourage weight loss.

How it works
The 20/20 diet consists of four main phases: the 5-day boost (phase 1), the 5-day sustain (phase 2), the 20-day attain (phase 3), and management (phase 4).
In addition, the diet encourages at least 3–4 hours of  moderate intensity  and 2–3 hours of high-intensity exercise per week, totaling around 5–7 hours of exercise per week during all phases.
Phase 1 is considered the most difficult phase of the 20/20 diet. During this phase, you’re only allowed to eat 20 power foods believed to help kick-start the weight loss process.
These include  almonds, fruit like apples, yogurt, tofu, and more. You must follow this phase for at least 5 days. Additionally, you must eat every 4 hours during waking hours.
Phase 2 allows for some additional flexibility, though arguably is still very strict. During this phase, you may stray from the list of 20 power foods but must include at least two at every meal and  snack .
Recommended foods to add include blueberries, cashews, and tuna. You must follow this phase for 5 days.
During phase 3, you’re allowed to introduce most foods back into your diet, though eating  highly processed foods  and foods high in simple carbohydrates is still discouraged.
You may also introduce two “sensible splurges” per day to avoid cravings and overeating. According to the diet, a “sensible splurge” is any food you enjoy eating. However, you must keep it under 100 calories.
Ideal foods to introduce during this phase include  avocados , raspberries, and potatoes.
After completing the first three phases, you enter the management phase to sustain any weight loss and lifestyle changes.
This phase is meant to occur indefinitely unless you  gain weight , at which point you would return to phase 1.
Ideally, you would still follow the same eating patterns as phase 3 while also monitoring your weight regularly, avoiding  emotional eating , and preventing a busy schedule from affecting your eating habits and exercise regimen.
During the four phases of the 20/20 diet, you start by eating solely from a list of 20 power foods and gradually reintroducing other foods. In addition, you learn psychological tips to prevent overeating and exercise regularly.

Foods to eat and avoid
Though the first two phases are quite strict, there are fewer food restrictions in the third and fourth phases. Here are common foods allowed and discouraged:
Any of the 20 power foods:  You’re encouraged to eat two foods from this list at every meal and snack.
Fruit and vegetables:  You can reintroduce most fruits,  non-starchy vegetables , and starchy vegetables in the third and fourth phases.
Meat and poultry:  You may introduce lean beef and chicken after Phase 1.
Dairy:  Yogurt is included in the list of 20 power foods. You may include cheese, milk, and other dairy products in moderation during phases 3 and 4.
Fish and seafood : Cod is one of the 20 power foods allowed during Phase 1. After this, you may add other fish and seafood due to their high nutritional value.
Healthy fats : Avocados, nuts, seeds, and oils are permitted during most phases of the diet.
Beverages : Drink 8–10 glasses of  water daily . Enjoy other beverages in moderation.
Simple sugars and refined carbs : These should be considered “sensible splurges” and kept to a minimum.
Processed foods : Foods commonly found in boxes, wrappers, or bags should be limited. Examples include chips, crackers, and pastries.
Fast food and takeout : The diet advises against any habit that previously led to weight gain. It advises limiting ready-made food and takeout to rare occasions.
Ultimately, the goal of the 20/20 diet is to stick with foods that are filling, low in calories, and minimally processed.
The first two phases of the diet have a number of food restrictions. However, few foods are off-limits during the last two phases.

Does it lead to weight loss?
Though you may lose weight on the diet, it’s not for the reasons the book claims.
The main idea of the diet is to eat foods with a high thermic effect. In turn, this should lead to fewer net calories being consumed.
While the TEF contributes to roughly  6-10%  of total daily calories burned for people who are sedentary, there’s  no evidence  that the 20-power foods advised specifically lead to greater  calorie expenditure .
In fact, some foods included later on in the diet would actually have a  higher TEF , including high protein foods like chicken and beef and high fiber vegetables and whole grains.
It is more likely for people to lose weight on the diet because they’re consuming more whole, high-satiety  foods  that are lower in calories, and they’re simultaneously increasing their physical activity.
Collectively, this results in the calorie deficit necessary for weight loss.
The 20 power foods are based on the premise that they have a high calorie-burning effect. Despite this claim, most people lose weight on the diet by achieving a calorie deficit.

Does it have any benefits?
In addition to weight loss, there may be a few other benefits to the 20/20 diet.
Helps reduce cravings:  After the first 10 days, the 20/20 diet allows all foods to be enjoyed in moderation. This may help reduce the likelihood of bingeing.
Encourages  regular exercise :  This is an  important component  of good health and weight loss success. By emphasizing movement that you enjoy, it increases the likelihood that you’ll stick with it long term.
Focuses on emotional eating:  In his book, Dr. Phil dives into the psychology of eating, such as emotional eating and environmental influences that drive people to eat. The 20/20 diet includes various tips to help you better  manage your eating habits . These may help you better understand the reasons behind your food choices and how to change your eating habits.
Benefits of the diet include eating food in moderation, paying attention to the reasons behind food choice, and encouraging regular exercise.

What are the downsides?
Despite some benefits, there are numerous downsides to the 20/20 diet.
Unnecessary restrictions:  Though the diet allows for flexibility past phase 2, the first two phases of the diet are unnecessary. Considering both phases in total last 10 days, any weight loss achieved is  most likely  water weight than actual fat loss. Practicing moderation from the get-go while getting regular exercise can create healthy long-term habits with v  unnecessary food restrictions .
May not be sustainable:  Recommending to return to phase 1 if you regain any weight suggests that the diet  may not be sustainable  long term.
May cause disordered eating:  This diet involves cutting out large groups of food and slowly adding them back in. For some, this  can lead  to a  negative relationship with food .
Contradictory messaging:  Despite claiming to embrace  intuitive eating  (eating based on your physiological hunger), the diet has strict rules that entirely go against the premise of intuitive eating.
One-size-fits-all approach:  Despite  research  suggesting weight loss is highly individual, this diet is a blanket approach to weight loss.
Major downsides of the 20/20 diet include its long list of food restrictions, problematic diet messaging, and one-size-fits-all approach.

Bottom line
The 20/20 diet is a weight loss diet created by television star and psychologist Dr. Phil.
There are some positive aspects of the diet, such as eating  mostly minimally processed foods , paying attention to your reasons for eating, and regular exercise. Collectively, these may help you lose weight.
However, the diet is very restrictive for the first two phases, which may lead to a disordered relationship with food. Further, it limits treats to 100-calorie servings, which may not be satisfying or sustainable.
Instead of trying the 20/20 diet, you may be better off focusing on sustainable healthy lifestyle habits like eating whole, nutrient-dense foods, exercising regularly,  managing stress , and developing a positive relationship with food.
