Title: 6 Health Benefits of CBD Oil — and a Look at Side Effects

Cannabidiol oil, or CBD oil derived from cannabis, is a popular natural remedy for many ailments. CBD oil benefits include pain relief and relaxation without any mind-altering effects.
People make CBD oil by extracting it from  the cannabis  plant and diluting it with a carrier oil like coconut oil or hemp seed oil. It’s one of more than  100 chemical compounds  called cannabinoids that are found in the cannabis plant,  Cannabis sativa .
Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)  is the main psychoactive cannabinoid found in cannabis, which means it causes the sensation of getting high that’s often associated with cannabis. However, unlike THC, CBD is not psychoactive.
CBD can be found in various products online and in stores, including dietary supplements, bath soaks, drinks, and food.
We’ve partnered with  Medterra  to bring you this article covering six evidence-backed health benefits of CBD.

1. May relieve pain
Cannabis has been used to treat pain since  2900 B.C ., with use originating in Chinese medicine. Researchers believe that components like CBD may be responsible for these effects.
The  endocannabinoid system  is involved in regulating functions like pain sensation. The body produces neurotransmitters called  endocannabinoids  that bind to cannabinoid receptors.
Studies  show that CBD may help  reduce chronic pain  by targeting endocannabinoid receptor activity, reducing inflammation, and interacting with neurotransmitters. Preclinical evidence also suggests that it may be effective  rheumatic diseases like  fibromyalgia , per  research from 2021 .
CBD may be effective for reducing certain types of pain associated with conditions such as fibromyalgia. Still, more research is needed to investigate its potential use in pain management.

2. Could reduce symptoms related to some mental health disorders
CBD oil has shown promise as a treatment for some  mental health disorders  leading many people who live with these conditions to become interested in this natural treatment approach.
A  2020 literature review  on CBD and mood disorders found that multiple studies suggest CBD has properties that may help reduce  symptoms of depression , anxiety, and even  psychosis .
A small  2019 study  also found that CBD was effective in reducing PTSD-related symptoms, including  nightmares , in adults.
That said, the available research has not been sufficient for doctors to recommend CBD as an actual treatment for such conditions.
CBD use has been shown to improve some symptoms related to mood disorders. Researchers are currently investigating how CBD may be used in the treatment of other mental health disorders.

3. May alleviate certain cancer-related symptoms
CBD may help reduce some cancer-related symptoms and side effects related to cancer treatment, such as nausea, vomiting, and pain, according to  research published in 2022 .
However, more research is needed to determine whether CBD should be used more regularly in cancer symptom management.
Though CBD may improve certain cancer-related symptoms in some people, research findings are currently mixed. More studies are needed to assess its effectiveness and safety.

4. May have neuroprotective properties
CBD may provide  benefits for those with neurological disorders . A  2022 study  suggests that nabiximols (Sativex) spray containing both CBD and THC may help reduce pain and  muscle spasticity  in people living with  multiple sclerosis  (MS).
Research from 2017  indicated that CBD oil helped reduce seizure activity in children with Dravet syndrome, but it also caused some adverse reactions.
The  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has approved one CBD product,  Epidiolex , for the treatment of several  seizure disorders  and seizures caused by tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). TSC is a rare genetic disease that causes  benign tumors  to grow in the brain and other body areas.
There’s also some limited evidence that CBD  may also be effective  in improving the symptoms of other neurological conditions, such as:
Parkinson’s disease
Huntington’s disease
autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
motor disorders like cerebral palsy
CBD may be effective for treating seizures related to several health conditions. The prescription CBD product Epidiolex has received FDA approval to treat seizures related to rare, seizure-causing conditions such as Dravet syndrome.

5. May benefit heart health
High blood pressure  is linked to higher risks of several health conditions, including stroke, heart attack, and metabolic syndrome.
Research indicates that CBD  may be beneficia l for people with high blood pressure because it can influence the contractions of the heart muscle and help widen blood vessels.
For example,  one study from 2020  that included 26 healthy men found that treatment with 600 milligrams of CBD for 7 days led to significant reductions in blood pressure in the short term compared with a  placebo  group. However, the effect was lost after 7 days.
While these findings are encouraging, more research into the potential benefits of CBD treatment on  heart health  is needed.
Though more human studies are needed, CBD may benefit heart health in several ways, including by reducing blood pressure and improving artery function.

6. Other potential benefits
CBD has been studied for its role in treating a number of health issues other than those outlined above.
Though more research is needed, CBD is thought to potentially provide the following health benefits:
Substance misuse treatment:  CBD  may be helpful  for relieving anxiety and depression in people who have a  dependence  on certain drugs, including  heroin , per preclinical evidence.
Possible extension of life in those with glioblastoma:  Treatment with a combination of CBD and THC  may help extend  the life of some people with an aggressive form of cancer called  glioblastoma , yet research is limited.
Possible improvement in sleep:  CBD  might help improve  sleep in people with certain  sleep disorders , though more research is needed.
Some research suggests that CBD may help with substance misuse disorders, sleep, and certain types of cancers. However, we need more research involving humans to find out more about these potential effects.

What are the drawbacks of CBD oil?
CBD is considered generally safe, but it  may cause  adverse reactions like diarrhea, changes in appetite and weight, and fatigue in some people.
Other side effects, including abnormal  liver function test  results,  drowsiness , sedation, and  pneumonia ,  have been reported  in childhood  epilepsy  research.
But these effects could stem from CBD interacting with other medications, such as clobazam, as it  can interact  with various drugs. It’s always a good idea to speak with a qualified healthcare professional about the right dosing for you and your risk of experiencing side effects.
Low quality CBD products are common in the marketplace, so it’s important to choose products that have been third-party tested for quality and purity.
NuLeaf Naturals  and  Bluebird Botanicals  are two examples of brands that sell CBD products that undergo testing by accredited third-party laboratories and offer batch reports on their websites.
