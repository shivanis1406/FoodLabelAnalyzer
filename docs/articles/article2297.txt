Title: What Is Meratrim, and Does It Work for Weight Loss?


Losing weight  and keeping it off can be difficult, and many people try to find quick solutions to their weight problem.
This has created a booming industry for weight loss supplements that are claimed to make things easier.
One to hit the spotlight is a natural supplement called Meratrim, a combination of two herbs that are said to block fat from being stored.
This article reviews the evidence behind Meratrim and whether it’s an effective weight loss supplement.

What is Meratrim, and how does it work?
Meratrim was created as a weight loss supplement by InterHealth Nutraceuticals.
The company tested various medicinal herbs for their ability to alter the  metabolism  of fat cells.
Extracts of two herbs —  Sphaeranthus indicus  and  Garcinia mangostana  — were found to be effective and combined in Meratrim in a 3:1 ratio.
Both herbs have been used for traditional medicinal purposes in the past ( 1 ,  2 ).
Interhealth Nutraceuticals claims that Meratrim can ( 3 ):
make it harder for fat cells to multiply
decrease the amount of fat that fat cells pick up from your bloodstream
help fat cells burn stored fat
Keep in mind that these results are based on test-tube studies. The human body often reacts quite differently than isolated cells.
Meratrim is a blend of two herbs —  Sphaeranthus Indicus  and  Garcinia mangostana . Its producers claim that these herbs have various positive effects on the metabolism of fat cells.

Does it work?
One study funded by InterHealth Nutraceuticals investigated the effects of taking Meratrim for 8 weeks. A total of 100 adults with obesity participated ( 4 ).
The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, which is the gold standard of scientific experiments in humans.
In the study, participants were split into two groups:
Meratrim group.  The people in this group took 400 mg of Meratrim, 30 minutes before breakfast and dinner.
Placebo group.  This group took a 400-mg placebo pill at the same time.
Both groups followed a strict 2,000-calorie diet and were instructed to walk 30 minutes per day.
At the end of the study, the Meratrim group had lost 11 pounds (5.2 kg), compared with only 3.3 pounds (1.5 kg) in the placebo group.
People taking the supplement also lost 4.7 inches (11.9 cm) from their waistlines, compared with 2.4 inches (6 cm) in the placebo group. This effect is significant, as belly fat is strongly linked to many diseases.
The Meratrim group also had much greater improvements in body mass index (BMI) and hip circumference.
Although losing weight is often primarily viewed as a benefit for your physical health, some of the most rewarding benefits of weight loss are related to quality of life.
People taking the supplement reported significantly improved physical function and self-esteem, as well as reduced public distress, compared with the placebo group.
Other health markers improved as well:
Total cholesterol.  Cholesterol levels went down by 28.3 mg/dL in the Meratrim group, compared with 11.5 mg/dL in the placebo group.
Triglycerides.  Blood levels of this marker decreased by 68.1 mg/dL in the Meratrim group, compared with 40.8 mg/dL in the control group.
Fasting glucose.  Levels in the Meratrim group went down by 13.4 mg/dL, compared with only 7mg/dL in the placebo group.
These improvements may lower your risk of heart disease,  diabetes , and other serious diseases in the long run.
Though these results are impressive, it’s important to keep in mind that the study was sponsored by the company that produces and sells the supplement. The funding source of a study can often affect the outcome ( 5 ,  6 ).
One study indicates that Meratrim can cause significant weight loss and improve various health markers. However, the study was paid for by the company that produces and sells the supplement.

Side effects, dosage, and how to use it
No studies have reported any side effects when Meratrim is taken at the recommended dose of 800 mg per day, divided into 2 doses. It appears to be safe and well tolerated ( 4 ).
Possible side effects of higher doses have not been studied in humans.
Safety and toxicological evaluation in rats concluded that no adverse effects were detected at a dose lower than 0.45 grams per pound (1 gram per kg) of body weight ( 7 ).
If you plan on trying this supplement, be sure to choose 100% pure Meratrim and read the label carefully to ensure the spelling is correct.
Meratrim appears to be safe and without side effects at the recommended dosage of 800 mg per day.

The bottom line
Meratrim is a weight loss supplement that combines extracts of two medicinal herbs.
One 8-week study that was paid for by its manufacturer showed it to be highly effective.
However, short-term weight loss solutions don’t work in the long term.
As with all weight loss supplements, taking Meratrim is unlikely to lead to long-term results unless followed by permanent changes in lifestyle and  dietary habits .
