Peloton is a fitness equipment brand that makes stationary bikes favored by fitness enthusiasts for its:
ergonomic design
live classes
convenient built-in screen
Despite the brand’s popularity, its bikes may not fit everyone well.
For one, the Peloton Bike only works with the Peloton’s All-Access membership, which costs $44 per month (unless you select “Just Ride” through the bike’s system).
If you already have a subscription to a different fitness app or would prefer to  stream classes using your own device , you may want to consider an alternative.
Some indoor cycling bikes offer a similar set of features to the Peloton Bike and Bike+ for a much more affordable price. Others also have additional features, including dual-sided pedals and rotating touch screens.
This guide explores the best Peloton alternatives, offering comparable features at various price points.

The NordicTrack S22i Studio Cycle is our pick for the best Peloton Bike alternative overall. It’s a great bike for people who want to bring the experience of a boutique fitness studio into their living room.

This high end bike is equipped with:

24 digital resistance levels
dual water bottle holders
a pair of 3-pound (lb) [1.4-kilogram (kg)] dumbbells
a rotating 22-inch (in) [56-centimeter (cm)] smart HD touch screen

It’s also one of the few smart bikes to offer motorized incline and decline controls.

Like other NordicTrack machines, the bike includes  iFit integration  for streaming live and on-demand classes.

The app also offers automatic incline and resistance adjustments as well as global workouts, which allow you to travel virtually to destinations around the world.

NordicTrack includes a 30-day family iFit membership with every purchase, which grants you access to hundreds of classes, including:

cycling
yoga
boot camp
strength training

After 1 month, you can choose to continue your subscription, which costs $39 per month for a family plan or $180 per year for an individual account, or cancel at any time.

You can learn more about the bike’s features and how it compares with other smart bike options in our  in-depth review of the NordicTrack S22i .

Echelon is one of Peloton’s biggest  competitors  — and for good reason.
When considering Peloton vs. Echelon, there are a few unique features of both bikes to keep in mind.

The Echelon Smart Connect EX-5 is a great option if you want the performance of a Peloton but don’t want to pay for some of Peloton’s high tech features.

The EX-5 retails for $699 and prices are prone to fluctuate. An Echelon membership is a little cheaper than a Peloton All-Access membership.

Instead of an integrated touch screen, the EX-5 has a rotating mount for your smart device, allowing you to stream classes using the  Echelon Fit app . There are three additional EX-5s Connect models with higher prices that come with built-in screens.

In addition to offering unlimited live and on-demand cycling classes, the Echelon Fit app keeps track of your performance during your ride.

Just keep in mind you need an Echelon Fit app membership. There are currently three membership options:
$39.99 for a monthly Premier subscription (or $11.99 per month for an off-equipment Fit Pass)
$399 for a yearly subscription
$699 for a 2-year subscription

The bike has 32 resistance levels. It also features adjustable handlebars and a narrow competition seat, which is designed to allow for a wider range of motion.

If you’re just getting into indoor cycling and are unsure where to start, check out the Schwinn IC4 Bike, which boasts 100 microadjustable resistance levels.

In addition to being easy to use, the bike is priced under $1,000, so it’s a great option if you’re not ready to invest in a higher end model.

The IC4 features a 40-lb (18-kg) flywheel and dual-sided pedals, which allow you to use SPD clips or your standard athletic shoes.

It also boasts:
a ventilated race-style seat
padded handlebars
an LCD console that displays metrics like speed, number of calories burned, time, and distance

Plus, it comes with a Bluetooth heart rate monitor armband.

While it doesn’t offer a built-in screen like the Peloton Bike, it’s Bluetooth enabled and can provide a media rack so you can use your device to access fitness apps — including the Peloton digital app.

Purchase of the bike includes a free 1-year subscription to the  JRNY app , which offers on-demand studio classes and virtual rides to destinations around the world.

Once your trial is up, the JRNY app costs $149 per year, which is about $12.42 per month.

You can learn more about how the Schwinn IC4 compares with competitors in our  full review .

This simple, no-frills stationary bike is our pick for the best Peloton Bike alternative under $500. The Fitness Pro II is a great option for people on a  tight budget  who want to get an effective workout at home.

It has a resistance knob to modify the intensity of your workout and a four-way adjustable seat to maximize comfort.

The bike also features a pulse sensor to track your heart rate and a digital monitor that displays the metrics of your ride.

While it doesn’t include programmed workouts or a touch screen, the Fitness Pro II has an integrated device holder for streaming classes on your smartphone or tablet.

You can also access workouts through the SunnyFit app, which offers roughly 500 free classes for subscribers. These don’t integrate with your bike the way smart bike classes do, but it’s nice to have the option for free, high quality classes.

While it’s similar in price to the Peloton Bike+, the Bowflex VeloCore features a unique design you won’t find in other smart bikes: It leans from side to side.

In addition to providing a more realistic biking experience, the bike’s swinging motion offers a serious  core workout .

The bike also has 100 levels of magnetic resistance to help create a smooth, quiet, and adjustable ride.


As a bonus, the bike includes a Bluetooth heart rate armband and a pair of 3-lb (1.4-kg) dumbbells. Your purchase also includes a 1-year JRNY membership, which you can continue for $149 per year after your trial ends.

The Bowflex VeloCore features dual-sided pedals and an adjustable seat. Just keep in mind that the seat doesn’t have much padding. You can buy a more comfortable seat cover if you prefer.

It’s also important to note that the HD touch screen is available in two sizes: 16 or 22 in (40.6 or 56 cm). The 22-in (56-cm) model costs about $400 more, but it comes with free shipping.

Like Peloton, Stryde is a studio-first company. Stryde teamed up with some of the best indoor cycling studios across the country to provide home cyclers with studio-style classes.

The Stryde bike is a high quality, sturdy indoor cycling bike with a 22-in (56-cm) HD screen. It integrates with the  Stryde app , where users can access hundreds of on-demand studio cycling classes from various high quality studios and instructors.

Keep in mind that you need an app membership to access the Stryde workouts. It’s not required to use the bike, but it’s the ticket to getting the most out of your bike. The app costs $29 per month and includes up to four profiles to track workout history and other performance metrics.

If you want a bike with a large touch screen for streaming workouts, the ProForm Studio Bike Pro 22 is a great option.

The 22-in (56-cm) HD touch screen can rotate, so you can see your workout easily whether you’re on the bike or doing a  strength workout  on the floor.

The bike features 24 levels of resistance, which iFit instructors can adjust automatically during classes.

Purchase of the bike includes a 30-day iFit membership, which costs $39 per month after the trial ends.

The bike also features a water bottle holder, a pair of 3-lb (1.4-kg) dumbbells, and an adjustable seat and handlebars.

However, because the max user weight is lower than that of many other options on the market, this bike isn’t a good fit for all users.

Do you like biking but also want to do  cross-training  exercises? The BODi Bike Studio (also known as MYX II Plus) provides everything you need.

In addition to the MYX II Bike, this package includes:

5 sets of dumbbells
a kettlebell
a 24-in (61-cm) EVA foam roller
a resistance band
a heart rate monitor
an exercise mat
a bike mat

Because the touch screen can swivel, it’s possible to do exercises both on the bike and while standing on the exercise mat nearby.

Another thing about the BODi Bike Studio’s MYX II bike is that it uses friction resistance, which is slightly louder and requires more maintenance than magnetic resistance.

Wondering how to choose between the MYX II and the BODi Bike Studio (also known as MYX II Plus)? See whether Healthline writer SaVanna Shoemaker felt the BODi Bike Studio was worth the higher price tag in her  hands-on review .

Does your workout data matter to you? If so, you’ll want to make sure the numbers are accurate and the information is stored so you can access it later. The Keiser M3i stands out in both these areas.

The M3i passed the  EN957-10 European Standard  for accuracy and safety because its power meter is so accurate.

Keiser’s  M Connect display  can be used with a wide range of popular apps (including Peloton’s) as well as free  Keiser apps . It tracks your:

speed
power
calories
heart rate
ride time

The M3i can also transmit to multiple Bluetooth devices at once. This means you can transmit your workout data to your cellphone or tablet at the same time the information is going to any other Bluetooth device you want.

The bike comes with the M Connect display, a tool kit for assembly, and a floor mat. There are also additional optional accessories, like a  Polar heart rate monitor .

Keep in mind, this technology comes with a higher cost and the M3i does not include a touch screen.

How to choose the best stationary bike
You might consider several factors when shopping for a  stationary bike .
First, because bikes are available in a variety of shapes and sizes, you can select one that’s adjustable and suits your:
height
weight
available space
It’s also a good idea to look for a bike with those small transportation wheels at the front or back to make it easier to move.
Look for a bike that allows you to set different workout levels and easily modify the resistance.
Finally, you may want to look into the type of:
seat
pedals
streaming capabilities
Magnetic resistance:  Magnets create tension against the flywheel without actually making contact. This resistance style is quiet, doesn’t require much maintenance, and can offer a high degree of resistance with the simple twist of a knob.
Friction (contact) resistance:  A felt or leather pad applies pressure to the flywheel. Slightly louder than magnetic resistance, friction resistance also requires more maintenance, as you’ll need to replace the pads when they wear down.
Air resistance:  Bikes with  air resistance  feature a large fan and are noisier than magnetic or friction bikes. Resistance is created by the blades pushing against the air and depends on how fast you pedal. These are popular for sprint and interval training.
Race-style/competition:  These seats are slimmer and allow for a wider range of motion.
Oversized:  This type provides extra cushioning for a comfortable ride.
Gel:  With plenty of cushion and padding, these seats help distribute your weight evenly and support your sit bones.
Standard:  This type of seat has a similar design to a basic road bike seat. Some brands offer standard seats that are slightly more padded than others.
Many beginning Peloton riders complain of the seat being uncomfortable and even painful at first. They often get used to it over time, though, usually after 10 to 20 rides during the first couple weeks of regular riding.
This was the case for our hands-on reviewer Morgan Blount, former RVO Health employee, who said, “I’ve had my bike for 3 years. At first, the seat hurt, but I got used to it.”
If you’re looking for comfort from the get-go, you may prefer a wider or more padded seat over a standard or competition-style saddle.
NOTE: Although cycling cleats link to what are called “clipless” pedals, they can be misleading. To clarify, the shoes are “clip-in” — the pedals are “clipless.”
Clipless refers to the old-school toe-clip-pedal and shoe-strap combo riders used to leverage to keep feet in place. Here’s a visual of the present-day cleat and pedal options:
SPD pedals:  These pedals hold your shoes in contact with the pedal and require compatible two-bolt cleats.
Look Delta pedals:  Also a type of clipless pedal, these use a three-hole design to hold your shoes in contact with the pedals. You need Delta-compatible cleats, which attach to any pair of three-bolt bike shoes.
Toe cages:  To avoid buying new shoes, some people prefer bikes with toe cages (or toe straps). Although clipless cycling shoes provide a more balanced and efficient pedal stroke, using your  athletic shoes  can make indoor cycling cheaper and more convenient.
Dual-sided pedals:  Several home exercise bikes offer pedals with clipless pedals on one side and toe cages on the other, allowing you to choose whether you want to invest in cycling cleats.
If you’re willing to spend a bit more, several home exercise bikes offer streaming capabilities for access to live and on-demand workouts.
While some models have touch screens, others include Bluetooth capabilities and tablet holders, which allow you to stream classes using your own device.
Unlike bikes that include device holders, smart bikes integrate with at least one  fitness app , such as the  Peloton App  or  iFit .
This is beneficial because app integration allows you to view your performance data, such as the distance or resistance level, on the app as you ride.
Many apps offer additional features such as automatic resistance control and live leaderboards during classes.
Just keep in mind that these apps require an additional monthly or yearly fee, though many brands include a free 30-day or 1-year trial with your purchase.
So if you’d rather watch TV, read a book, or listen to music while you ride, you’re better off buying a less expensive bike without these features.

Benefits of smart exercise bikes
Working out at home on an exercise bike offers  many health benefits .
For starters, because you don’t have to worry about the weather or time of day, a stationary bike can offer you a way to get consistent exercise conveniently.
Cycling can help strengthen your leg muscles without placing a lot of pressure on your joints. A  2019 research review  found that, in combination with a nutrient-rich diet, regular exercise on a stationary bike may also help:
lower cholesterol
lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease
promote and maintain weight loss
increase bone mineral density in older people, reducing the risk of a fracture
A  2020 research review  found that indoor cycling may help relieve pain and improve function in people with knee osteoarthritis.
Exercising on a bike can also help improve your mood and ease symptoms of:
stress
depression
anxiety
According to a  2018 study  including more than 1.2 million U.S. adults, regular exercise of any kind is associated with improved mental health — and team sports, cycling, and aerobic and gym activities seem particularly beneficial.
Smart bikes have the added benefit of making it easier to:
track your performance over time
follow along with trainer-led classes from the comfort of your home
join a virtual fitness community
Exercising with others and being able to record your progress can help boost motivation and enjoyment, according to a  2020 study .

In fact, for a hands-on review of enjoying the Peloton app with an alternative bike, you can read Healthline Multimedia Editor  Kristin Currin-Sheehan’s DIY Peloton hack here .
In the digital app, you can select classes based on various filters, such as:
instructor
popularity
music type
mood
body focus
difficulty
class duration
In the app, you can also:
see milestones
track your workout streak
bookmark and preload classes to take at a later time

Yes, you can use your Peloton Bike without a subscription by selecting the “Just Ride” mode, which allows you to use the bike like a regular indoor cycling bike without the interactive classes.
That said, the app is a big part of the Peloton experience, so if you’re not interested in using the app, a Peloton Bike may not be worth the cost.
For those seeking the best exercise bike without a subscription, consider options like the Schwinn IC4 or the Sunny Health & Fitness SF-B1995, which offer robust features without mandatory ongoing fees.

The bottom line
Although the Peloton Bike and Bike+ are two of the most popular indoor bikes on the market, they may not work for everyone.
If you’re looking for something different, there are alternative  exercise bike options for home  workouts. Some of these bikes are less expensive, and others provide features not offered on either Peloton bike.
When selecting a stationary bike, you can check the available features carefully and look for a product that suits your:
height
weight
budget
exercise goals
