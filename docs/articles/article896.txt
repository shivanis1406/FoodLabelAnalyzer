Title: Brown Vs. White Rice —Is One Better for Your Health?

Brown rice is a whole grain while white rice has had some parts of the grain removed. Each type provides a slightly different amount of nutrients.
Rice is a versatile grain consumed by people around the world. It serves as a staple food for many people, especially in countries like China, Japan, India, Indonesia, and South Korea.
There are more than 7,000 varieties of rice and several colors, shapes, and sizes. The most common varieties in the United States are white rice and brown rice. White rice is the most commonly consumed type, but brown rice is also a popular option.
This article looks at the benefits and drawbacks of both white rice and brown rice.

The difference between brown rice and white rice
All rice  consists primarily of carbs, with small amounts of protein and practically no fat.
However, brown rice is a whole grain. That means it contains all parts of the grain — including the fibrous bran, the nutritious germ, and the carb-rich endosperm. It’s chewy and takes a while to cook due to its tough bran exterior.
White rice, on the other hand, has had the bran and germ removed. Because these are the most nutritious parts of the grain, white rice is left with very few essential nutrients. However, white rice is softer and tends to cook quicker.

Brown rice benefits
Brown rice has several advantages from a health perspective.
Brown rice has a slight advantage over white rice when it comes to nutrient content. It has more fiber and antioxidants, as well as more vitamins and minerals. However, these differences aren’t hugely significant.
For comparison, 100 grams (3.5 ounces) of cooked brown rice provide  1.6 grams  of fiber, whereas 100 grams (3.5 ounces) of white provide only  0.4 grams  of fiber.
In  the US and 5 other countries , white rice is required to be fortified with iron following the milling process, which is why white rice is shown below to have more iron than brown rice.
The list below compares other vitamins and minerals in terms of their percentage of a person’s recommended  Daily Value (DV) :
Brown rice is  high in magnesium  and fiber, both of which help control blood sugar levels.
Research suggests  that regularly eating whole grains, like brown rice, helps  lower blood sugar levels  and decreases the risk of type 2 diabetes. Even just replacing white rice with brown has been shown to lower blood sugar levels and decrease type 2 diabetes risk.
On the other hand, eating lots of white rice has been  linked to  an increased risk of diabetes.
This may be due to its high glycemic index (GI). The GI measures how quickly a food increases your blood sugar.
Brown rice has an average GI of  about 65  and white rice has an average GI of  about 73 , meaning that white rice increases blood sugar levels faster than brown. Still, both are very high in carbs, which will cause your blood sugar levels to rise.
However, you can lower the GI of white rice by cooling it. This forms  resistant starch , which moves through your digestive tract unchanged and works similarly to soluble fiber.
If you can, cook your rice the day before you want to consume it. Then, store it in the refrigerator overnight. Reheat when you are ready to eat it.
You can also combine rice with foods like vinegar or oil, which  can lower the GI . Furthermore, you can try other varieties of rice with lower GIs, such as:
basmati
red
black
wild
Studies  suggest that eating brown rice instead of white rice helps reduce several risk factors for heart disease .
An  analysis  of 45 studies found that people who ate the most whole grains, including brown rice, had a 16–21% lower risk of heart disease than people who ate the fewest whole grains.
Whole grains like brown rice  may also lower  total and LDL (“bad”) cholesterol. Brown rice has even  been linked to  an increase in HDL (“good”) cholesterol. But these findings aren’t consistent across all populations.
The bran of brown rice contains many powerful  antioxidants , which can help neutralize harmful free radical compounds and reduce inflammation in the body.
Studies  show that due to their antioxidant levels, whole grains like brown rice may help prevent chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes.
Eating brown rice instead of white  may also  significantly reduce weight, body mass index (BMI), and circumference of the waist and hips.
In  one study  including 29,683 adults and 15,280 children, researchers found that eating more whole grains was linked to moderate body weight in both adults and children.
A recent  meta-analysis  of 13 clinical trials found brown rice reduced weight, BMI and waist circumference when compared to white rice.  Another study  compared to those mentioned in this section that found white rice, but not brown rice, was associated with an increased risk of weight gain.

White rice benefits
White rice is a staple in many traditional types of cuisine and has been for many centuries — so it’s not without its benefits.
Antinutrients  are plant compounds that may reduce your body’s ability to absorb certain nutrients. Brown rice contains an antinutrient known as phytic acid, or phytate, that makes it more difficult to digest.
While  phytic acid  may offer some health benefits, it also reduces your body’s ability to absorb iron and zinc from food. Soaking rice before cooking can help retain some of the nutritional value.
Over the long term, eating phytic acid with most meals may contribute to mineral deficiencies. However, this is very unlikely for people who eat a varied diet.
Brown rice tends to be higher in arsenic than white rice.
Arsenic is a toxic heavy metal that is naturally present in the environment, but it has been increasing in some areas due to pollution. Significant amounts have been  identified  in rice and rice-based products.
Long-term consumption of arsenic may increase your risk of chronic diseases including cancer, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes.
However, this should not be a concern if you eat rice in moderation as part of a varied diet. A few servings per week should be fine.
If rice is a big part of your diet, you should take some steps to minimize the arsenic content. There are several effective tips  in this article .

The bottom line
While white rice and brown rice are high in starch, brown rice contains more fiber, nutrients, and antioxidants. When eating white rice, add legumes and vegetables to ensure that you are having a more nutrient dense meal.
That said, either type of rice can be part of a healthy diet — as evidenced by the long history of white rice in the traditional cuisine of many cultures. Brown rice may have a more favorable nutrition profile, but there’s nothing wrong with having white rice as a part of a balanced diet.
