Title: The 8 Best Meal Replacement Products

Eating a balanced and nutritious diet is the best way to stay healthy, but sometimes a busy lifestyle or other circumstances make it hard to prepare a full meal.
Meal replacement systems are meant to help you get a meal’s worth of nutrients when you don’t have the time or access to enjoy a proper meal.
The most popular alternatives include shakes, bars, and powders. Products high in protein and fiber help increase fullness and satiety, so we focused on products that prioritize these.
You may want to incorporate meal replacement products into your diet to either gain, lose, or maintain your weight. Because they are pre-measured portions in terms of calories, carbs, fat, and protein, they make reaching these goals easier to track.
However, just as everybody has different nutritional needs, not all meal replacements are created equal. Therefore, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to replacing a meal.
Still, some alternatives may provide you with added energy and nutrients to get you through the day.

Comparing meal replacement brands

How to choose
When shopping for a meal replacement, make sure to get one that provides a good  ratio of macronutrients  — protein, carbs, and fat — that best fits your lifestyle.
Generally, try to go for an option containing at least 15–25 grams of protein, 10–15 grams of fat, over 10 vitamins and minerals, and over 3 grams of fiber per serving — and avoid those with added sugars.
What’s more, look for high quality brands that use whole food ingredients and third-party quality testing to ensure you’re getting the best possible alternative to a nutritious meal.
Also, consider the product’s packaging to ensure it’s convenient enough to fit your needs, and consider complementing it with nutrient-rich foods if going for an option that’s below 400 calories per serving.
Still, remember that meal replacement systems are meant to be a convenient way to get your nutrients when you’re short on time, on the go, or don’t have access to high quality foods.
They may also come in handy if you’re having a hard time getting a high number of calories into your day or doing endurance activities, such as biking or hiking.
However, they shouldn’t replace your everyday meals. Instead, aim to eat whole, nutritious meals the majority of the time and only opt for meal replacements every once in a while.
Lastly, though meal replacements may be a  successful weight loss strategy  for adults, there’s not enough evidence to support this practice among children and adolescents ( 1 ).
Making lifestyle modifications would be the best approach for sustainable, long-term weight loss.

What to know about meal replacement products
Aside from being convenient for when you just can’t enjoy a proper meal, meal replacement products offer multiple benefits.
For starters, since they provide fixed and known amounts of calories and nutrients, they’re a helpful strategy that aid with portion management for weight loss ( 2 ,  3 ).
Additionally, a 2018 study of 200 people showed that meal replacement products may help long-term adherence to weight loss programs because their simple structure and convenience make weight loss easier to follow ( 4 ).
They may also help improve metabolic markers such as blood pressure, fasting blood sugar and insulin, and blood cholesterol levels ( 5 ,  7 ).
Similarly, a 2015 study of 1,767 participants showed that people who consumed meal replacement products in combination with conventional foods tend to make dietary choices that improve dietary quality ( 6 ).
These choices include consuming more fruits, vegetables, and yogurt and reducing fat and sweets intake ( 6 ).
Studies also found a greater vitamin and mineral intake in people who include meal replacement products as part of their weight loss diet than those following a low calorie diet made exclusively of conventional foods ( 4 ,  6 ).
Lastly, meal replacement products can be a healthier alternative to fast foods while helping satisfy cravings for sweets and other unhealthy starchy meals ( 2 ).
Regardless of their multiple benefits, meal replacement products also have some disadvantages.
One of the primary downsides discussed by nutritional professionals is that they only offer a temporary solution for weight loss rather than encouraging permanent changes in eating habits ( 8 ).
This means that if consumed for weight loss purposes, they may not be effective in the long run.
In fact, one 2020 study of 260 participants found that in people who completed a meal replacement-based weight loss program, significant initial weight loss was followed by substantial weight regain ( 8 ,  9 ).
What’s more, evidence suggests that meal replacement products may even promote unhealthy relationships with food.
Since some provide as little as 130 calories per serving, they might be used to compensate for calorie overconsumption after indulging in a rewarding or palatable food — meaning that they may promote disordered eating habits such as binge eating in some people ( 10 ).
Finally, there are cases of products being contaminated with heavy metals or containing higher amounts of caffeine than reported on the label ( 11 ).

Frequently asked questions about meal replacements
Since meal replacement products are primarily meant to provide a meal’s worth of nutrients whenever life gets in the way, their intake frequency can vary significantly from one person to another.
However, if you have a busy schedule or are part of a supervised weight loss program, you could have them daily.
Choosing one type of product over the other depends greatly on your personal needs.
For example, if you need to have a quick lunch during or between work meetings, then sipping on a shake will most likely be the most convenient option. However, suppose you need one on a hike.
In that case, it’s probably more practical to eat a protein bar since its packaging is easier to save for later disposal.
Furthermore, consider your appetite and whether you’re trying to lose weight when choosing between a shake or a bar.
This is because chewing your food increases appetite-related gut hormones. Thus, solid or chunkier foods such as protein bars produce higher feelings of fullness than liquid foods — leading to a reduced food intake ( 12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ).
Like their intake frequency, deciding which meal is best to replace with a shake will most likely be influenced by your schedule or needs.
However, research suggests that replacing breakfast and/or afternoon snacks may improve your diet quality ( 2 ).
Breakfasts are often comprised of foods rich in saturated fats and high glycemic index (GI) carbs, which spike your blood sugar levels.
Therefore, by swapping it for a shake, you may enjoy a more nutritionally balanced meal. This is especially important for people with type 2 diabetes ( 2 ,  16 ).
Replacing your afternoon snack with a shake or bar may help control cravings for sweets and other processed foods ( 2 ).
Filling your nutritional needs based solely on meal replacement products may lead to an insufficient daily caloric intake, as many products provide very few calories to make up a whole meal. In fact, some may be two to three times lower in calories than an average meal ( 17 ,  18 ).
Consuming too few calories can be detrimental to your health because your body will have a hard time maintaining normal bodily functions. It can also directly affect your mental capacities and concentration ( 19 ).
Moreover, while meal replacement products can be nutritionally balanced, they lack other nutrients or bioactive compounds such as antioxidants and phytochemicals present in fruits and vegetables that are also needed for optimal health ( 20 ).
Therefore, it would be best to pair your meal replacement shakes with other foods to increase your caloric intake and complete your meal’s nutritional profile.
Yes. In fact, studies have found that partial meal replacement plans — which consist of two meal replacements per day combined with additional meals made from conventional foods — are a successful strategy for weight loss ( 6 ).
However, it may be deficient in calories and nutrients for weight maintenance. Thus, it isn’t recommended for extended periods of time ( 6 ).
On the contrary, keep in mind that drinking two meal replacement shakes per day in addition to your meals, the extra calories can easily lead to weight gain by creating a calorie surplus.

The bottom line
Meal replacement systems are designed to help you fit a meal’s worth of nutrients whenever enjoying a  wholesome meal  isn’t an option.
You may find them as bars, shakes, and powders in a variety of flavors and comprising various nutrient compositions.
When shopping for meal replacements, choose high quality brands that use wholesome ingredients and consider which nutrient ratio and packaging work best for you.
