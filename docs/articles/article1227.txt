Healthline’s picks for the 7 best healthy chips

Pros:  made with a handful of ingredients, certified organic, low in sodium

There’s a lot to love about Barnana plantain chips.
First, these chips are made with just three ingredients: organic plantains, organic coconut oil, and  Himalayan pink salt . They’re also vegan, paleo-friendly, certified organic, and kosher ( 2 ).
What’s more, the Himalayan Pink Sea Salt flavor is low in sodium, with just 75 mg per 1-ounce (28-gram) serving, so these chips a good alternative for those watching their sodium intake.

Jackson’s Honest sweet potato chips are a great choice when cravings for crunchy, salty snacks hit.
These chips are made with just three ingredients:  sweet potatoes , coconut oil, and sea salt. Coconut oil is an excellent choice for frying chips because of its stability at high temperatures ( 3 ).
Many popular chips are fried in canola oil. Although it’s stable at high temperatures, canola oil is high in omega-6 fats, which can increase inflammation in your body when consumed in excess ( 4 ,  5 ).
Because modern diets tend to be high in omega-6 fats and low in anti-inflammatory omega-3s, it’s best to reduce your intake of refined omega-6-rich oils such as canola oil.
These chips are also slightly higher in fiber and lower in sodium than traditional potato chips ( 6 ,  7 ).

Many cheese puff products contain a number of ingredients that aren’t good for overall health, including artificial flavors, artificial coloring, and flavor enhancers like  monosodium glutamate (MSG) .
They also tend to be high in sodium and calories, which can make them a less-than-ideal snack choice ( 10 ,  11 ).
Still, there are healthier cheese puff choices on the market, including Lesser Evil Paleo Puffs.
The “No Cheese” cheesy flavor comes from nutritious ingredients such as coconut oil, sweet potato powder,  nutritional yeast , and ground mustard. These puffs don’t contain any artificial colors, flavorings, or flavor enhancers.

They’re made with limited ingredients and come in a variety of flavors — including Nacho, Ranch, Sea Salt, and Jalapeño Lime — so there’s an option for even the pickiest chip lover.
Siete uses avocado oil to make these chips, which is a healthier alternative to highly refined oils like canola and soybean oil ( 14 ).

How to choose
When shopping for healthy chip options, it’s important to choose products based on their ingredients and nutritional profile.
Generally, the fewer ingredients, the better. However, some healthy chips may contain more ingredients than others if they’re flavored. Spices, nutritional yeast, and salt are examples of healthy flavoring ingredients that may be listed on the back of chip bags.
Look for chips that aren’t made with artificial coloring or flavoring, and don’t contain added sugar. Added sugar can be listed  in many ways  on ingredient labels, including high fructose corn syrup and cane sugar.
Another factor to consider is the calorie and macronutrient content of the product.
Choose chips that deliver 150 calories or fewer per 1-ounce (28-gram) serving to maintain healthy snacking portions.
Also, because most chips are typically low in protein and fiber, it’s a good idea to pair them with a protein- and fiber-rich dip like  hummus  or black bean dip to make your snack more nutritionally complete.
Additionally, if you have any food restrictions, it’s important to choose chips that fit into your dietary pattern.
