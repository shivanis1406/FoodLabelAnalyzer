If you’ve discovered you have a deficiency in vitamin D, you’re not alone. It’s particularly common among people who get limited sun exposure, as well as people with dark skin, people over age 65 years, and people who smoke. Breastfed infants and children with certain medical conditions are also susceptible to vitamin D deficiency.
If a healthcare professional has recommended a vitamin D supplement for calcium absorption, bone health, or muscle growth and development, we’ve vetted and narrowed down our recommendations to eight supplements for when vitamin D from sun exposure is not enough or inaccessible.

If you have a severe vitamin D deficiency, a healthcare professional will likely recommend taking a high dose supplement — at least 10,000 international units (IU) daily. This may be followed by a maintenance dose of  up to 6,000 IU  once your levels normalize.
Pure Encapsulations Vitamin D3 gets our pick as the best high dose vitamin D option because it’s third-party tested and provides 10,000 IU per serving.
Plus, unlike other products on the market, it’s hypoallergenic, non-GMO, and  gluten-free , so it’s a great choice for people with food allergies or dietary restrictions.
Keep in mind that this product is not suitable for vegans since it contains vitamin D3 derived from lanolin, a type of fat secreted from sheep’s wool.
However, Pure Encapsulations also offers a lower dose vegan-friendly  alternative , which is made with vitamin D3 sourced from algae.

Thorne Vitamin D/K2 Liquid wins our vote because it’s one of the few vitamin D supplements that also provides  vitamin K2 , which  works together  with vitamin D and is necessary for heart and bone health.
This supplement also offers a convenient way to take your dose of vitamin D, especially if you dislike taking capsules or have difficulty swallowing. These drops can be mixed into any food or beverage.
It’s one of the most affordable options on our list and is free of soy, gluten, dairy, and artificial flavors and additives. Plus, it’s vegetarian-friendly, as it contains vitamin D derived from lanolin and vitamin K2 from  geraniol , a plant-based compound found in many essential oils.

For people who prefer getting their nutrient supplements in chewable form, NOW’s budget-friendly, sugar-free offering packs 5,000 IU of vitamin D3. This product is easy to find at many retailers and online.
Sweetened with the  sugar alcohols  sorbitol and  xylitol , it also contains natural vanilla and peppermint flavors. Additionally, it’s kosher, soy-free, and gluten-free.
Note that because this product is made with  cellulose , the vitamin D it contains is  less absorbable  than the vitamin D in oil-based capsules.

Mindbodygreen vitamin D3 potency+ contains a blend of vitamin D3 and organic  medium-chain triglycerides (MCT)  from coconut, which can help improve absorption and potentially make it easier to digest. This is because vitamin D is a  fat-soluble vitamin  and requires dietary fat in order to be absorbed.
This product contains organic flaxseed oil, avocado oil, extra virgin olive oil, and omega-3 and omega-9 fatty acids. It’s also non-GMO, dairy-free, soy-free, and gluten-free. There is gelatin in the product, though, so it’s not suitable for vegans.

Mindbodygreen products are third-party tested, but the names of the labs aren’t disclosed.

Healthline editors Candice Abellon and Kelli McGrane both tested mindbodygreen’s Vitamin D3.
“I’d recommend these vitamin D capsules based on the fact that they were easy to swallow,” Abellon commented. She also noted the high quality packaging and the substantial feel of the brown glass bottle, highlighting its aesthetic and protective qualities.
That being said, she cautioned, “It’s nice that the D3 for this vitamin is derived from a plant or algae, but the capsule has bovine gelatin, so it’s not vegetarian or vegan.”
McGrane appreciates the brand’s commitment to quality and third-party testing, finding the product easy to use daily with its one-a-day formulation.
“With that said,” she added, “the company’s products aren’t cheap, and some ingredients seem like they’re there more for advertising purposes than because there’s substantial research to back up their effectiveness.”
McGrane continued, “While I do like the product, I’m debating continuing with it because I have to purchase it from mindbodygreen’s website.”
Lastly, as a registered dietitian, McGrane also raised a concern about the high dosage of this product, advising that it is best suited for those specifically directed by a healthcare professional to take 5,000 IUs of vitamin D.

Refresh on vitamin D
Vitamin D is not common in food
Sun exposure is the main source of vitamin D.
There are two forms of vitamin D
Vitamin D2 is found in plants, and vitamin D3 is found in animal-sourced food, like fish oil.
Many benefits of vitamin D
It helps with calcium absorption, bone health, immune function, and disease prevention.
Vitamin D  is an essential nutrient that plays a key role in  many aspects of health .
Because vitamin D is found naturally in very few  food sources  and is mostly obtained through sun exposure, many people have an increased risk of deficiency.
Vitamin D supplements can help ensure that you’re  getting the amount of vitamin D you need . They come in two forms:  vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 . While both forms can increase blood levels of vitamin D, vitamin D3 can raise vitamin D levels higher and for longer than vitamin D2.

How to choose the best vitamin D supplement for you
Before you decide on a vitamin D supplement, getting your nutrient levels checked is wise. A blood test is the only way to find out whether you are deficient, insufficient, sufficient, or optimal in any nutrient.
A healthcare professional can order blood work and help you determine an appropriate dosage if a supplement is necessary for you.  At-home testing kits  may also be useful to measure your vitamin D levels.
