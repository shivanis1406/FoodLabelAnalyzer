Best organic protein powder
Protein type   pea, rice
Certifications   USDA organic, certified vegan, third-party tested for purity and potency
Available flavors   Chocolate, Vanilla, Vanilla Chai, Unflavored
*Price may vary.

This Ora Organics vegan protein powder features a variety of plant-based ingredients, including peas, rice, sprouted quinoa,  amaranth , and hemp seed.

It’s not only suitable for those following vegan or vegetarian diets but also a great option for people who are lactose intolerant or follow a gluten-free diet.

Additionally, this vegan protein powder is certified organic and tested for heavy metals by third-party labs to ensure safety. However, the name of the third-party testing lab is not disclosed.

It’s also free of artificial ingredients and sweetened with stevia,  monk fruit , and brown rice syrup. However, it does contain coconut, which some people may need to avoid.

“I’ve tried a handful of plant-based protein powders on the market, and Ora Organics is my favorite vanilla-flavored powder. Specifically, it lacks the cloyingly sweet, artificial vanilla flavor that many other powders have.
“I also appreciate that the powder mixes easily in a shaker bottle and actually feels refreshing to drink. I primarily use it in my overnight oats for a boost of protein in the morning, but it’s also delicious blended into a green smoothie with a frozen banana, strawberries, and a handful of spinach.”

“[Ritual Essential Protein Daily Shake Pregnancy] blends well into a simple smoothie with fruit, and I feel reassured that the ingredients are traceable and high quality.
“My only complaint is that I wish it came in a tub. It can be messy to scoop out of the bag each time (always gets on my hands), and the seal isn’t the easiest to re-close.”

“As a registered dietitian, I appreciate the company’s commitment to traceable ingredients, and that the Daily Shake 18+ is third-party certified.
“I found the powder easy to mix and didn’t experience any clumping. However, the consistency was a bit too thick for my taste. I also found the vanilla flavor to be artificial-tasting and too overpowering compared to other powders I’ve tried.”

Gainful  is a subscription-based service that creates customized protein blends formulated just for you, which are sourced from ingredients, such as peas, brown rice, oat powder, or whey.

The brand’s online quiz collects information about your health goals, lifestyle habits, exercise routine, and dietary restrictions and recommends a protein powder designed to fit your needs.
For this reason, Gainful may be a great option for those interested in a customized protein blend to support muscle growth.
All Gainful protein powders are free of gluten, soy, and artificial flavors and sweeteners. They’re also unflavored and can be combined with the brand’s Flavor Boosts, which are available in eight unique varieties.

Although it’s more costly than other protein powders, each Gainful subscription includes personalized nutrition and fitness advice and access to a registered dietitian.

Nutrition stats vary as products are customized. Most formulations contain 19 g–26 g per scoop (30 g).


“My blend was a keto-friendly protein powder made with whey protein isolate and MCT oil that provided 140 calories and 19 g of protein per scoop.
“While it smelled a bit like coconut because of the MCT oil, there wasn’t a noticeable coconut flavor once it was mixed. I particularly enjoyed the powder prepared with unsweetened vanilla almond milk and the Chocolate Peanut Butter Flavor Boost.
“Overall, I was really impressed with Gainful and would consider Gainful again if I became more serious about my training. However, for right now, I’ll probably stick with a less expensive alternative.”
— SaVanna Shoemaker, MS, RDN, LD, Healthline contributor

Other protein powders to consider
In addition to the protein powders listed above, we also considered several other products derived from various protein sources, including collagen peptides, egg whites, rice, and hemp.
These might be a good option if you have certain dietary restrictions or food allergies and need to limit specific ingredients commonly found in protein powders, such as casein or whey.
Some protein sources may also offer additional health benefits, such as collagen for  bone  and  joint  health.
Here are a few of our other top picks to consider:
Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides
NOW Sports Egg White Protein
BulkSupplements Organic Rice Protein
Navitas Organic Hemp Powder

Best protein powder comparison
Here’s a quick look at how our top picks compare:
*”Third-party tested” refers to whether the product is third-party tested to confirm purity and potency.
**”Safe for sport” refers to whether the product is certified by a third-party organization, such as NSF or Informed Sport, to confirm that it’s free of substances banned in competitive sports.
Note that the price per serving in the table above may vary depending on where you shop, the container size, and the flavor.

How we chose the best protein powders
Healthline’s dietitians determined the best protein powders using the following criteria:
Ingredient and nutrient quality:  We looked for products that are made from high quality ingredients and contain minimal amounts of added sugars and artificial additives.
Quality testing:  We prioritized products that are third-party tested for quality, accuracy, and purity. We also looked for products that are third-party certified to be safe for competitive athletes.
Reviews:  The protein powders listed below either have been tried and recommended by Healthline editors or have mostly positive online reviews.
Price:  We included options to suit a variety of budgets.
Additionally, every brand and product on our list has been  vetted  to ensure that it aligns with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being. Each product in this article meets the following criteria:
FDA compliance:  All brands and products adhere to allowable health claims and labeling requirements, per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. Additionally, products are manufactured in facilities that adhere to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices established by the FDA.
Medical and business standards:  Products are produced by medically credible companies that follow ethical, legal, and industry best standards. Companies also provide objective measures of trust, such as having their supplements validated by third-party labs.
Health claims:  Products don’t make outlandish health or medical claims, and any claims that are made align with Healthline’s approach to well-being.

How each type of protein powder works
The type of protein powder you choose depends on your dietary needs, health goals, and personal preferences.
Whey:  Whey is a milk-based protein that’s quickly and easily digested and absorbed. When combined with resistance training,  whey protein  may help  increase  muscle mass,  support  growth, and  speed  up post-workout recovery, so it’s a great choice for athletes.
Casein:   Casein  is a protein in milk that’s  digested and absorbed slowly , which can help you feel full longer, so it may help reduce your appetite. The slower digestion and absorption rate  may also support  muscle growth and recovery over longer periods.
Egg white:  Egg white protein  is a great alternative to whey or casein protein, especially for people with an allergy to dairy products.
Collagen powder:   Collagen  is a component of muscles, and supplementing with it may have benefits for  bone  and  joint  health. However, collagen is not a complete protein and doesn’t build and repair muscles optimally like other sources of protein, such as whey, pea, and egg.
Plant-based:  People following a vegan lifestyle  should opt  for plant-based protein sources, such as pea or brown rice. These can also be suitable for people who follow a dairy-free diet or have trouble digesting dairy or lactose.
Whey protein, in particular, is available in concentrate, isolate, or hydrolysate form, although many supplements contain a combination of the three.
Although whey concentrate and isolate offer similar benefits, whey protein isolate undergoes processing methods that result in a higher concentration of protein and lower amounts of fat, carbs, and lactose.
Meanwhile, whey hydrolysate, or hydrolyzed whey, has been  partially broken down  to ease digestion and speed absorption.

The benefits of using protein powder
Protein powder can be a quick and convenient option to increase your protein intake.
This may be especially beneficial for people who have increased protein needs, have difficulty meeting their needs through food sources alone, or have certain dietary restrictions, such as a vegan or vegetarian diet.
Many athletes take protein powder after exercising, which  may help enhance  muscle growth and speed up post-workout recovery.
Additionally, enjoying a  protein shake  or high protein snack may even  support  weight loss by increasing feelings of fullness between meals.

How to choose a protein powder
Protein source:  Protein powders contain either animal-based or plant-based protein sources. Examples of animal-based proteins include  casein , whey,  collagen , and egg.  Plant-based protein powders  often contain pea, rice, soy, or hemp protein. Some vegan blends also contain whole grains, nuts, and seeds.
Additional ingredients:  Look for protein powders that have as few ingredients as possible. Always check the labels carefully, and consider avoiding products containing artificial sweeteners, colors, and flavors.
Quality testing:  Because the FDA doesn’t evaluate the safety, quality, or effectiveness of protein powders, it’s best to choose products that are third-party tested to ensure purity and potency.
“Safe for sport” designation:  Competitive athletes may want to choose a protein powder that has been tested for banned substances by an organization such as  NSF International  or  Informed Sport .
Flavors and texture:  Protein powders come in a variety of flavors, and some mix more easily than others. Online reviews, ingredient lists (specifically the type of sweetener[s] used), and single-serving packets can all help with deciding whether a product will suit your palate or not.

How to use protein powder
Keep in mind that protein powder shouldn’t be used to replace healthy sources of protein in your diet because  high protein foods  also provide other valuable nutrients, such as fiber, vitamins, and minerals.
Still, supplements can be an easy and convenient way to increase your protein intake, as there are many ways to use protein powder.
The simplest way is to mix it with a beverage, such as water or milk, or blend it with other ingredients, such as fruits and veggies, to create a smoothie.
You can also mix protein powder into simple foods, such as yogurt, oatmeal, or dips.
If you feel like getting creative, you can experiment with using protein powder as an addition or substitution in your usual recipes. For example, you can use protein powder in soups, veggie burgers, pancakes, and baked goods.
To save time, make a larger portion of smoothie mixture and freeze it to make individual ice pops.
The  best time to take protein powder  depends on your health goals. You may want to have one large portion or several small portions of protein per day.
To lose weight:  Try incorporating more high protein foods throughout the day, as  studies show  that increasing your intake of protein could help reduce appetite and cravings.
To improve athletic performance or endurance:  When to consume protein powder  largely depends on your overall fitness goals. While research suggests that the amount of protein you consume throughout the day is  more important  than the timing, many experts still  recommend  consuming protein post-training or post-competition.
To build muscle:  It’s generally recommended to consume protein powder  within 2 hours  of a weightlifting session.  Some research  also suggests that taking protein powder before you go to sleep may help your muscles recover overnight. But research shows that daily protein intake is the most important factor in muscle building.
To prevent muscle loss:  Focus on eating moderate amounts of protein throughout the day to  help prevent  muscle loss in older adults.

Frequently asked questions
Protein powders are generally well tolerated and have few side effects, so they’re safe for most adults.
However, certain types of protein may affect you, especially in terms of digestion. Certain types of protein can cause gas, bloating, or stomach cramps. Skin reactions are also possible.
Some supplements could contain contaminants, such as yeast or bacteria, which  can cause  foodborne illness.
They may also contain heavy metals, which can  negatively affect  the health of your kidneys, brain, thyroid gland, and reproductive system if consumed in large amounts.
Choosing a high quality product that has undergone third-party testing for purity and potency can help minimize the risk of contamination with these harmful compounds.

However, certain types of protein may affect you, especially in terms of digestion. Certain types of protein can cause gas, bloating, or stomach cramps. Skin reactions are also possible.
Some supplements could contain contaminants, such as yeast or bacteria, which  can cause  foodborne illness.

Plant-based protein can be a great option for vegans and people who are unable to tolerate dairy. However, whey and plant-based protein powders offer a similar set of health benefits.
For example,  some research  suggests that whey protein and pea-based protein can be  equally effective  at increasing muscle growth and strength, as long as they contain the same amount of protein and branched-chain amino acids — a group of amino acids that boost muscle building — per serving.

The bottom line
When trying a new protein powder, pay attention to how your body responds. As with any supplement, you may wish to take a break every so often or alternate between different products.
Many people get plenty of protein from the foods they eat.
However, if you’re trying to increase your protein intake, having a protein shake or adding protein powder to foods, like oatmeal and yogurt, can help you meet your needs.
Finally, try to consume plenty of whole, fresh foods, including natural sources of protein and fiber, as well as plenty of water.
