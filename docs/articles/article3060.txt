age-related macular degeneration

diabetic retinopathy

Mark Mauceri, partner of a Healthline employee, tried Throne’s multivitamin for longer than a month and found that it was helpful for him. “After I finished the 180-count bottle, my takeaway was YES, I do feel (and look) a bit better.
“The recommended dose is 3 to 6 capsules a day, which is a lot of pills. I experimented with the full 6 at first and then tapered down to 3 and ultimately 2 a day. Do I really need 588% of the FDA’s recommended daily amount of vitamin B6? Probably not. Ditto 1787% of vitamin E.”
“The comfort factor in taking a daily multivitamin is that on any given day, you’ve covered your basic needs regardless of what you had to eat. …
“I’d recommend experimenting with the number of daily capsules, factoring in what you’re already getting from the foods you eat regularly. Like other things in life, your mileage may vary.”

How we chose
We chose the top supplements for men over 50 based on the following criteria:
Expert recommendation:  The supplements below were selected and reviewed by registered dietitians.
Ingredients:  We selected multivitamins that are made with high quality ingredients and free of additives, fillers, and artificial sweeteners.
Nutritional value:  We selected products containing specific nutrients that are most important for men over 50. We also looked for multivitamins containing highly absorbable forms of these nutrients.
Quality testing:  We prioritized products that are thoroughly tested for purity, potency, and quality, ideally by third-party organizations.
Every brand and product on our list has been  vetted  to ensure that it aligns with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being. Each product in this article:
adheres to allowable health claims and labeling requirements, per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations
is manufactured in facilities that adhere to the current good manufacturing practices established by the FDA
is produced by a medically credible company that follows ethical, legal, and industry best standards
is made by a company that provides objective measures of trust, such as having its supplements validated by third-party labs

How to choose a multivitamin
There are several factors you may want to consider when selecting a multivitamin:
Nutritional content:  Check the ingredients label carefully and look for a supplement that provides the vitamins and minerals that matter most to you. A doctor or registered dietitian can provide personalized recommendations on which nutrients and doses you should look for or avoid, depending on your health goals and needs.
Form:  Multivitamins are available in a variety of forms, including capsules, tablets, gummies, and chews. Consider which form you’re most comfortable with to find a product that works for you.
Dosage:  If you have trouble remembering to take your multivitamin each day, a convenient once-daily supplement might be your best bet.
Quality:  Select products that are manufactured by well-known brands. It’s also a good idea to look for a seal from an organization such as NSF or USP, which often indicates that a supplement has undergone third-party testing for quality and safety.
Dietary restrictions:  If you have any food allergies or dietary restrictions, be sure to select a supplement that meets your needs.
Budget:  Multivitamins are available at a wide range of prices. Calculate the price per serving to find a product that fits your budget.
For healthy adults, multivitamins are likely safe when used as directed. However, it’s best to check with a healthcare professional before starting supplementation, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking other supplements or prescription medications.

Which nutrients are particularly important for men over 50?
Micronutrient needs can vary based on several factors, including your age, sex, and health status.
However, certain vitamins and minerals may be especially important for men over 50,  including :
Vitamin A:  supports immune function
B vitamins:  involved in energy production
Vitamin B12:   important for bone health , brain health, and mood
Vitamin C:  enhances wound healing, skin health, and immunity
Calcium and magnesium:  supports  bone strength
Vitamin D:  required for bone health, immune function, and prostate health
Vitamin K:   improves  blood clotting and wound healing
Choline:  involved in maintaining brain function
Selenium:   promotes  immune function and brain health
As you age, your body’s ability to absorb specific nutrients — including calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B12 — may decline. Therefore, getting enough of these vitamins and minerals in your diet is important to prevent deficiencies.
While more studies are needed,  research  suggests that supplementing with high doses of vitamin E could potentially increase the risk of prostate cancer in healthy men.
For this reason, it’s best to steer clear of supplements with high doses of vitamin E unless advised by a doctor. A healthcare professional can also address any concerns about the safety of multivitamins that contain vitamin E and provide personalized guidance.

Do men over 50 need a multivitamin?
Though multivitamins are not necessary for everyone, they may be beneficial in certain cases, such as:
Dietary restrictions:  If you have a more restricted diet, a multivitamin may be useful for bridging gaps in your diet.
Health concerns:  Nutritional needs often vary for people with certain medical conditions or health concerns, and some people may need a multivitamin to help meet their unique nutritional needs. Additionally,  some conditions  can make nutrient absorption more challenging.
Lack of access to nutritious foods:  If you find it difficult to consume enough nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, a multivitamin might be worth considering.
Older age:  Research  suggests that your body’s ability to digest and absorb certain nutrients declines as you age. Additionally, nutritional deficiencies appear to be more common after age 65. For this reason, a doctor might recommend taking a multivitamin to  support adequate nutrient intake .
Before adding a multivitamin to your routine, it’s best to talk with a health professional such as a doctor or registered dietitian. This is especially important if you have any health conditions or are taking any medications.
Also keep in mind that combining multivitamins with other supplements or fortified foods that contain high doses of specific nutrients  may lead  to overconsumption of nutrients. This can negatively affect your health.

When to talk with a doctor
It’s best to talk with a healthcare professional before adding a multivitamin to your routine, especially if you have any health conditions or are taking any medications.
A healthcare professional can provide personalized supplement recommendations depending on your needs.
If your diet lacks only a few nutrients, a healthcare professional may recommend single-nutrient supplements instead.
Alternatively, a doctor or dietitian may recommend that you try to meet your nutritional needs by making changes to your diet before adding a supplement.
