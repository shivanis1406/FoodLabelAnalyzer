Title: Are Veggie Straws Healthy? How They Compare with Other Chips

Veggie straws are a popular but controversial packaged snack.
They’re marketed as a healthy snack, a fun way to consume vegetables, and a better alternative to potato chips.
But although “veggie” is in its name, this snack may not be all that it’s worked up to be.
This article explains whether veggie straws are healthy, how they compare with other chips, and fun ways you can meet your daily vegetable intake.

What are veggie straws?
Veggie straws are a packaged snack that is crunchy, salty, and often compared to potato chips.
While there are several brand options, the original is the  Garden Veggie Straws, Sea Salt  produced by Sensible Portions in 2005.
They’re a certified gluten-free, kosher product that boasts of having no ingredients from genetically modified organisms and no artificial flavors or preservatives.

How are they made?
Based on the ingredient listing on the product package, these chips are made from:
potato starch
potato flour
expeller pressed canola oil or safflower oil or sunflower oil
spinach powder
tomato  paste
salt
cane sugar
corn starch
potassium chloride
turmeric
beetroot powder
sea salt
Ingredients are listed in order of quantity. So, the first ingredient listed is the one used in the highest amount.
Therefore, potato starch, potato flour, and a combination of vegetable oils — as the first three ingredients — make up most of this snack.
The chips are deep-fried to produce an airy, crunchy, and flavorful product.

Fun ways to meet your daily vegetable intake
Packaged snacks, like veggie straws, aren’t the ideal way to meet your daily vegetable intake.
Here are easy and simple homemade vegetable snacks:
Raw veggies with a dip.  You can also try carrots with hummus or celery with peanut butter.
Air-fried veggies.  You get the same crispy texture with real vegetables rather than vegetable powders. Try these  pumpkin fries  or  herb and lemon cauliflower  snacks.
Baked chips.  If you don’t have an air fryer, you can bake your chips to achieve a similar outcome. Check out this baked  beetroot, sweet potato, and potato  snack.
Smoothies.  Another fun way to boost your veggie intake is to add some to your smoothies or even make  fruit and vegetable freezer pops .
Roasted chickpeas.  These  crispy snacks  can be made in the oven or air fryer.
Packaged snacks shouldn’t be used to replace vegetables. Homemade veggies and dip, air-fried or baked veggies, and smoothies or freezer pops are fun ways to meet your daily vegetable intake.

The bottom line
Veggie straws are a packaged snack that is often marketed as a healthier alternative to potato chips.
However, this snack is primarily made from potato starch, potato flour, and a combination of vegetable oils that make it nutritionally similar to regular potato chips and tortilla chips.
It’s a fun snack that can be enjoyed in moderation, but it shouldn’t replace your regular intake of whole vegetables.
