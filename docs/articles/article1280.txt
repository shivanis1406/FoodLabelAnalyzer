Title: What Are Grits, and Are They Nutritious?

While grits are incredibly popular, many people wonder whether they’re good for you. This article reviews grits, including their nutrition, benefits, and whether they’re healthy.
Grits are a popular dish widely consumed across the Southern United States.
They’re made from dried, ground corn ( Maize ) cooked in various liquids — including water, milk, or broth — until the mix reaches a thick, creamy, porridge-like consistency. The consistency of grits varies. Some people prefer runny grits, while some prefer theirs creamy and thick.

What are grits?
Grits are a popular dish in the American South, made from crushed or ground  corn . They originated in Native American culture.
They’re most commonly served as a breakfast or side dish and usually made from a variety of corn called dent corn, which has a softer, starchy kernel ( 1 ).
The crushed corn granules are typically cooked in either hot water, milk, or broth until they reach a thick yet creamy consistency that is similar to porridge.
Grits are often paired with flavorful ingredients, such as butter, sugar, syrups, cheeses, and meats like  bacon , shrimp, and catfish.
You can purchase several varieties of grits, including:
Stone-ground.  These are made from whole, dried corn kernels that are coarsely ground in a mill. This type is becoming easier to find in grocery stores. They have a shelf life of up to one year and take 30–60 minutes to cook on the stove ( 2 ).
Hominy.  These are made from corn kernels soaked in an alkali solution to soften the tough pericarp (outer shell or hull). The pericarp is rinsed, then removed, and the corn kernels undergo further processing to make hominy ( 3 ).
Quick and regular.  These types undergo processing, which involves removing the pericarp and germ (nutrient-rich embryo), so they have a longer shelf life. Regular versions are medium ground while quick are finely ground ( 2 ).
Instant.  This precooked, dehydrated version has had both the pericarp and germ removed. They’re widely available in grocery stores.

Grits nutrition facts
Grits contain a variety of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
One quarter cup (41 grams) of cooked, regular grits provides the following nutrients ( 4 ,  5 ):
Calories:  182
Protein:  4 grams
Fat:  1 gram
Carbs:  38 grams
Fiber:  2 grams
Folate:  18% of the Daily Value (DV)
Thiamine:  18% of the DV
Niacin:  13% of the DV
Riboflavin:  11% of the DV
Iron:  8% of the DV
Magnesium:  4% of the DV
Zinc:  4% of the DV
Phosphorus:  4% of the DV
What’s most impressive about grits is that they’re high in  iron , which is essential for red blood cell production. They also include many B vitamins, such as folate and thiamine, as well as trace amounts of potassium, pantothenic acid, calcium, and vitamin E ( 6 ).
However, regular versions contain fewer vitamins and minerals — like calcium and vitamins A and C — than the stone-ground varieties made from whole corn kernels ( 4 ).
That’s because they undergo several stages of processing, which removes nutritious parts of the corn like the pericarp and germ ( 2 ).
Grits provide a variety of nutrients and are especially high in iron and B vitamins. Stone-ground varieties are more nutritious, as they don’t have the pericarp and germ removed.

Health benefits of grits
Because grits are highly nutritious, eating them may offer some impressive health benefits.
Hominy grits are prepared using a process called nixtamalization, a technique of cooking corn kernels in alkaline water.
Nixtamalization increases calcium and iron content, and makes the niacin and amino acids in the corn easier for the body to absorb ( 7 ,  8 ).
Antioxidants are substances that protect your cells against free radical damage.
Free radicals are highly reactive molecules that can interact with your cells and cause damage that has been linked to chronic conditions, including heart disease and certain cancers ( 9 ).
Grits contain powerful antioxidants — including lutein, zeaxanthin, caffeic acid, 4-OH benzoic acid, and syringic acid — which have been linked to powerful health benefits ( 10 ).
Gluten is a family of proteins found in grains like wheat, barley, spelt, and rye.
Most people can eat gluten-based foods without adverse effects. However, people with  celiac disease  or non-celiac gluten sensitivity may experience side effects, such as bloating, diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain, and fatigue ( 11 ,  12 ).
Grits are naturally  gluten-free , which means they’re a suitable carb alternative for people who have to avoid this family of proteins.
Still, if you have celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, read the label for warnings of gluten contamination. Some manufacturers process corn in the same facilities as gluten-based products.
Grits contain  lutein and zeaxanthin  — important antioxidants for  eye health .
Human studies show that lutein and zeaxanthin may protect against degenerative eye disorders like cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), as well as protect your skin from sun damage ( 13 ,  14 ,  15 ).
Both are found in high concentrations inside the retina — the part of your eye that converts light into signals your brain can understand ( 16 ).
What’s more, these antioxidants may protect your eyes against damage by potentially harmful  blue light  ( 17 ).
Blue-wavelength light helps your body know it’s daytime by suppressing the production of melatonin — a hormone that helps your body relax so it can get deep sleep.
However, too much blue-wavelength light exposure can damage the cornea — your eye’s outermost layer ( 18 ).
Anemia is a condition in which your muscles and tissues don’t receive enough oxygen to work effectively. Symptoms include fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath ( 18 ).
A common cause of anemia is  iron deficiency . Without iron, your body cannot make enough hemoglobin — a substance that helps red blood cells carry oxygen ( 19 ).
Grits may help protect against iron-deficiency anemia. They’re a great source of plant-based iron, with one cup (257 grams) providing around 8% of the DV ( 4 ,  5 ).
A folate deficiency can also cause anemia, as folate helps your body make red blood cells. Grits are high in folate — offering 18% of the DV per cup (257 grams) ( 4 ,  5 ,  21 ).
Grits may help combat anemia and protect against several degenerative eye disorders. They’re also naturally gluten-free and a good source of antioxidants.

Considerations of grits
While grits offer some impressive potential benefits, keep some things in mind.
For starters, the widely available varieties — such as quick, regular, or instant — are made by a process that removes the corn kernel pericarp (outer skin) and germ (embryo). This leaves just the endosperm, the starchy component ( 2 ).
The pericarp and germ are loaded with nutrients, so quick, regular, or instant varieties don’t include all the nutrients you would expect from the stone-ground versions, which are made from whole corn kernels ( 2 ).
For example, processed grits contain less fiber than whole corn kernels, as they’re made from corn with the pericarp removed. The pericarp is a major source of fiber.
Fiber is a type of indigestible carbohydrate that has been linked to  health benefits  like improved digestion, lower blood cholesterol, increased feelings of fullness, and weight loss ( 22 ).
While stone-ground versions are a more nutritious choice, they’re more difficult to find in grocery stores — especially if you live outside the Southern United States.
The nutritional profile of grits can vary, since they’re typically made with or served alongside high-calorie ingredients, such as milk,  butter , cheese, syrups, bacon, and fried catfish.
Quick, regular, and instant grits have fewer nutrients than the stone-ground variety. Additionally, they’re typically paired with high-calorie ingredients, which may lead to weight gain if eaten too frequently.

Different ways to prepare grits
Though grits are typically paired with calorie-rich ingredients, you can prepare them in many nutritious ways.
For more fiber, stone ground grits or add vegetables to your dish. For a balanced meal add your favorite protein like catfish to your grits.

The bottom line
Grits are a staple dish in the American South, made from ground, dried corn and particularly rich in iron and B vitamins.
Stone-ground varieties are more nutritious, as they undergo less processing than quick, regular, or instant types.
Though grits are fairly healthy, they’re typically served with high-calorie ingredients. These may include milk, cheeses, syrups, sugar, bacon, and other fried or processed meats.
Choosing healthy, lower-calorie alternatives, such as  fresh fruit , in place of sugar and syrups or using more water and broth instead of whole milk is a simple way to cut back on calories.
