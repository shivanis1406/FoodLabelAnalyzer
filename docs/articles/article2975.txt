Healthline’s picks for the best vegan protein powders

Best overall
Protein type   plant-based blend
Number of servings   19 per container

Nutrition stats per serving   (Vanilla) Calories: 160, Total carbs: 7 g, Added sugar: 0 g, Fat: 3 g, Protein: 30 g
Price   $$
Garden of Life Sport Organic Plant-Based Protein Power is our pick for the best overall vegan protein powder thanks to its high quality ingredients and nutritional profile.
It includes protein derived from a variety of sources to help balance its amino acid profile, including peas, navy beans, lentils, garbanzo beans, and cranberry.
In addition to 30 grams (g) of protein per serving, the powder packs 2 g of fiber and is free of added sugars.
It’s certified organic and comes in two flavors (Vanilla and Chocolate). While it’s not the easiest to mix with water or  plant-based milk , it works great in a smoothie.
What’s more, this product is  NSF Certified for Sport , which means it’s undergone third-party testing to ensure that it doesn’t contain unsafe levels of contaminants or substances that are banned by competitive sports organizations. It’s also  Informed Choice certified .
But it’s worth noting that this product contains a few proprietary blends. Some people prefer to avoid proprietary blends because the exact amounts of the ingredients included in these blends aren’t disclosed.
“I tried the Chocolate flavor and thought it was pretty good. I’m not much of a fan of stevia, but it wasn’t as noticeable in this protein powder compared to similar ones I’ve tried. While it definitely tastes sweet, it wasn’t overly sweet in my opinion. The Chocolate flavor is mild and enjoyable.
“It has 30 grams of protein per serving, but to get that amount, you have to use two full scoops. That felt like a LOT of powder to me, especially when mixed with the suggested 12 ounces of liquid. It was pretty clumpy until I used a blender. That made it smooth, though it’s still pretty thick.
“I will say the 30 g of protein made this pretty filling  —  I couldn’t finish a whole serving. I’ll probably end up just having one scoop at a time as I work my way through the container.”

This Ora Organic protein powder is certified organic by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), so it’s a good option if you prefer to  eat organic .
The powder boasts 22 g of protein and a variety of organic greens in each serving, making it easy to squeeze more micronutrients into your daily diet.
It also includes a proprietary blend of nutrient-rich foods and greens, including organic pea protein, rice protein, cranberry, blueberry,  turmeric , pomegranate, and kale. But keep in mind that the specific amount of each ingredient in the blend is not listed.

“Ora Organics is my favorite vanilla-flavored powder as it lacks the cloyingly sweet, artificial vanilla flavor that many other powders have.
“I also appreciate that the powder mixes easily in a shaker bottle and actually feels refreshing to drink.
“I primarily use the powder in my overnight oats for a boost of protein in the morning, but it’s also delicious blended into a green smoothie with a frozen banana, strawberries, and a handful of spinach.”

This protein powder has a smooth, chocolaty flavor thanks to ingredients like organic cacao, organic coconut milk, and  monk fruit .
Each serving contains 20 g of protein and contains all nine essential amino acids, which are sourced from a blend of pea protein, flaxseed, quinoa, pumpkin seeds, and chia seeds.
While Chocolate is the crowd-favorite flavor (according to Amazon reviews), KOS offers its organic plant-based protein in several other flavors, including Vanilla, Chocolate Peanut Butter, Blueberry Muffin, and Peanut Butter. There’s also an unflavored variety if you prefer an option that’s less sweet.
KOS doesn’t include any third-party testing information on its website.
Additionally, note that it contains inulin, a type of prebiotic fiber that  can cause  digestive issues for some people.
“I was curious to try KOS as it has rave reviews for its flavor. I found that the chocolate powder lived up to the hype: It was rich and chocolaty without any lingering aftertaste.
“While it’s a bit clumpy when combined with just water in a shaker bottle, I found the texture to be pleasantly thick and creamy when blended into a smoothie.
“I really liked the flavor. However, I found that after a day or two of drinking KOS I regularly felt bloated and had slight pain from the pressure. The product does contain inulin, which can be tricky for some people, like myself, with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).”
—  Kelli McGrane , MS, RD, Healthline nutrition editor
“I tried both the Chocolate and Chocolate Peanut Butter flavors. Both tasted too sweet to me, though the Chocolate Peanut Butter is less sweet compared with the Chocolate.
“They do taste pretty flavorful, though, so I’d still recommend this protein powder to those looking for a sweeter option, or anyone who doesn’t mind the taste of stevia.”

Price   $
For those seeking a simple plant-based protein powder made without artificial flavors, sweeteners, or colors, this product from Naked Nutrition is worth a try.
It’s sourced exclusively from raw yellow  peas  and contains 27 g of protein per serving. It also contains between 2.85 milligrams (mg) [16% daily value (DV)] and 9 mg (50% DV) of iron per serving, making it a good choice for people who menstruate. It’s estimated that  30% of women  will experience  iron deficiency  during their reproductive years.
The protein powder is also certified vegan and gluten-free and produced using environmentally friendly farming practices.
Plus, it’s certified by Informed Choice, a quality assurance program that tests sports supplements to ensure they’re free of impurities, contaminants, and banned substances.
However, while pea protein  contains all  nine essential amino acids, note that it is  relatively low  in methionine. Therefore, it’s best to enjoy this protein powder as part of a balanced diet alongside other protein-rich plant foods.
“Since Naked Pea is sweetened with coconut sugar instead of stevia or monk fruit, I was excited to give them a shot. I bought the sample packets so that I could try all three flavors.
“Normally I’m a chocolate person, so I expected to like the Chocolate flavor the best, but it was just so-so in my opinion. It didn’t have a very strong flavor, though it was still good blended with almond milk and a half a frozen banana. I did notice that they have a flavor called Double Chocolate, so that may be more up my alley.
“Of the three I tried, though, Vanilla was my favorite. It was flavorful without being too sweet, and it had a nice mellow vanilla flavor  —  not artificial at all.
“The Unflavored is a good basic option if you’re looking for something to mix with other flavor profiles. I wouldn’t drink it just mixed in water or almond milk, but in a smoothie, it was enjoyable, and again, not too sweet.”

For athletes looking to boost their post-workout protein intake, this Vega Sport protein powder is a great option because it’s also formulated with  tart cherry  extract, an ingredient that’s been  studied  for its ability to boost post-workout recovery.
It features 30 g of protein per serving, which is made from a blend of plant-based sources like peas,  pumpkin seeds , sunflower seeds, and alfalfa.
What’s more, the protein powder is NSF Certified for Sport, so it’s worth considering for competitive athletes.
“I tried the Peanut Butter flavor of Vega Sport. It kind of reminds me of the powdered peanut butter PB2  —  it has a pretty mild peanut taste and is lightly sweet. Compared to other Vega protein powders, it has a less noticeable stevia taste in my opinion.
“It blends fairly well in almond milk without needing to use a blender. Like Garden of Life’s Sport protein powder, it takes a pretty hefty amount of powder to reach the full serving size. At 30 grams of protein, it felt really filling, and I wasn’t able to finish the whole thing.”

The best vegan protein powders compared

Other vegan protein powders we tried
Ritual Essential Protein Daily Shake 18+ :  This powder is third-party tested, Informed Sport certified, and made from traceable ingredients, including organic pea protein sourced from U.S.-grown peas. Plus, at just 115 calories, 0 g of sugar, and 3 g of fiber per serving, it may be a good choice for those looking to lose weight. However, our tester wasn’t impressed with the flavor, which she felt tasted artificial, or the thick texture.
Gainful Personalized Protein Powder :  We were intrigued by Gainful’s customization options (you can add flavor boosts to create your own mix), but the texture fell short for us. It remained somewhat grainy mixed with almond milk and in a smoothie. With only 10 servings in a container, it has a high price per serving compared with other options on our list.
Orgain Simple Organic Plant-Based Protein Powder :  This protein powder contains 35% of the daily value (DV) for iron, making it a good choice for people who menstruate. It’s also organic and free of sugar substitutes. However, in testing, we found it to be a little too sweet, with 5 g of added sugar (from coconut sugar) per serving. Additionally, while Orgain says on its website that all of its products have been third-party tested, it doesn’t disclose any information about the testing organization.

My experience with protein powders:  Despite my best efforts to eat a balanced diet, between being a full-time working mom with two toddlers and not always having the best appetite, I often fall short of meeting my nutrient needs for the day.
While I occasionally drink protein powder with just oat milk in a shaker bottle after a hard workout, I primarily use protein powders in smoothies, along with leafy greens, frozen fruit, and hemp or chia seeds.
I’ve easily tried more than 15 protein powders over the years, and I almost always have containers of both chocolate and vanilla powders in my pantry.
Name:  Chelsea Logan
Role:  Healthline senior editor
My experience with protein powders:  I eat a pretty balanced diet, but I like to supplement with protein powders from time to time to ensure I’m getting enough protein. I was vegetarian for over 20 years before transitioning to fully vegan 2 years ago.
I’ve probably tried around 10 protein powders over the years. I generally prefer unflavored and unsweetened varieties, though sometimes I’ll switch it up and use a flavored option. With flavored protein powders, I prefer something that’s not too sweet, and I’m more likely to choose something with sugar than a sugar substitute.
I usually consume protein powder mixed into a smoothie with almond milk, frozen fruit, and sometimes other ingredients like ground flaxseed.
Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the products on this page, we considered all the protein powders that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further.

How to choose the best vegan protein powder
Below are several factors to consider when shopping for a  vegan protein powder .
If you have any food allergies, restrictions, or intolerances, be sure to carefully read ingredient labels and consider opting for products that are certified vegan or allergen-free.
You may want to avoid products that contain high amounts of added sugars or  artificial sweeteners , flavors, fillers, and preservatives. If you prefer to eat organic, look for products that are certified organic by the USDA.
Ideally, look for products that have undergone third-party testing by an organization, like NSF International or Informed Choice, to ensure that the contents of the powder match the label. These organizations also test for heavy metals and contaminants.
If you’re a competitive athlete, you’ll want to choose a product that’s  NSF Certified for Sport  or  Informed Sport certified  to avoid consuming substances that are banned by most competitive sports organizations.
With so many protein powders available, you’re sure to find one that fits your budget. Remember to consider the number of servings per container when deciding what price you’re comfortable with.
Some vegan protein powders are available in a variety of flavors, while others are unflavored. Consider your preferences and how you plan to use your protein powder.
For example, if you prefer to combine your powder with milk or water, you may want to choose a flavored product. But if you plan on mixing the powder into smoothies or food items, an unflavored powder might be best.
It’s also worth reading customer reviews to see what people have to say about the powder’s texture. For example, is it easy to blend in a shaker bottle, or do you need an electric blender to avoid clumps?
Depending on your goals, some vegan protein powders may be better than others. For example, if you’re looking to lose weight, a low calorie powder may be suitable.
Alternatively, if you’re working to  build muscle , a vegan protein powder that contains a blend of plant-based sources  may be more effective  than a single-source product.

Potential risks of vegan protein powders
Vegan protein powders are generally well tolerated and aren’t known to have serious negative side effects.
It’s worth noting, however, that plant-based protein powders may contain more heavy metals than other protein powders because plants take in heavy metals from the soil, air, and water.
Research  has found that the amounts of heavy metals found in protein powders aren’t large enough to cause any adverse effects at typical intakes of 1 to 3 servings per day.
Generally, it’s a good idea to opt for products that have been third-party tested for the presence of heavy metals and other contaminants.

Frequently asked questions about vegan protein powder
While more research is needed,  some studies  suggest that products containing a blend of plant-based proteins may have higher amounts of  leucine  and may be more effective for muscle building than single-source vegan protein powders.
While more research is needed,  some studies  suggest that products containing a blend of plant-based proteins may have higher amounts of  leucine  and may be more effective for muscle building than single-source vegan protein powders.
You can mix any vegan protein powder into liquid to form an easily drinkable shake. We recommend adding it to a blender or shaker cup with your desired liquid, like water or oat milk, to get a smooth consistency.

Complete protein sources include all nine essential amino acids. However, most plant-based protein sources are low in one or more amino acids. If you eat a plant-based diet, it’s important to combine plant protein sources in order to get all nine amino acids.
For example, our top choice, Garden of Life Sport Organic Plant-Based Protein Power, blends peas, navy beans, lentils, garbanzo beans, and cranberry to contain all essential amino acids.

The bottom line
Whether you follow a vegan lifestyle or simply prefer plant-based products, there are several vegan-friendly protein powders to choose from.
To narrow down your options, be sure to consider factors, such as the type of protein used, available flavors, nutritional profile, and cost.
You may also want to choose a product that’s free of fillers, preservatives, and artificial flavors or sweeteners.
Look for products that have undergone third-party testing. If you’re a competitive athlete, be sure to select protein powders that are certified safe for sport.
Regardless of which product you choose, be sure to talk with a healthcare professional before adding any new supplements to your wellness routine.
