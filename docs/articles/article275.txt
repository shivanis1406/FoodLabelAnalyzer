Title: 10 Supplements to Help Lower Blood Sugar

Certain supplements, including cinnamon and aloe vera, may help lower blood sugar.
Some supplements may have a beneficial effect on blood glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes. However, research into supplement efficacy in managing the condition is often mixed.
Here are 10 supplements that may help lower blood sugar.

1. Cinnamon
Cinnamon supplements are either made from whole cinnamon powder or an extract. Many studies suggest it helps lower blood sugar and  improves diabetes control .
Cinnamon  may help your body’s cells better respond to insulin. In turn, this allows sugar into your cells,  lowering blood sugar .
The common Cassia variety of cinnamon contains more coumarin, which may harm your liver in high amounts.

2. American Ginseng
American ginseng, a variety grown primarily in North America, has decreased post-meal blood sugar by  about 20%  in healthy individuals and those with type 2 diabetes.
American ginseng may improve your cells’ response to and  increase  your body’s insulin secretion.
Ginseng can decrease the effectiveness of warfarin, a blood thinner, so avoid this combination. It may also stimulate your immune system, which could interfere with immunosuppressant drugs.

3. Probiotics
Damage to your gut bacteria — such as from taking antibiotics —  is associated  with an increased risk of several diseases, including diabetes.
Probiotic supplements , which contain beneficial bacteria or other microbes, offer numerous health benefits and  may improve  your body’s handling of carbohydrates.
Animal studies suggest that probiotics may decrease blood sugar by reducing inflammation and preventing the destruction of pancreatic cells that make insulin. Several other mechanisms may be involved as well.
Probiotics are  unlikely to cause harm , but in certain rare circumstances, they could lead to infections in people with significantly impaired immune systems.

4. Aloe Vera
Aloe vera may also help those trying to lower their blood sugar.
Supplements or juice made from the leaves of this cactus-like plant  could help lower  fasting blood sugar and A1C in people with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.
Mouse studies indicate that aloe  may stimulate  insulin production in pancreatic cells, but this hasn’t been confirmed. Several other mechanisms may be involved.
In a review of nine studies in people with type 2 diabetes, supplementing with aloe for  4–14 weeks  decreased fasting blood sugar by 46.6 mg/dl and A1C by 1.05%.
Aloe can interact with several medications, so check with your doctor before using it. It should never be taken with the heart medication digoxin.

5. Berberine
Berberine isn’t a specific herb but rather a bitter-tasting compound taken from the roots and stems of certain plants, including goldenseal and Phellodendron.
A review of 27 studies in people with type 2 diabetes observed that taking  berberine  in combination with diet and lifestyle changes reduced fasting blood sugar by 15.5 mg/dl and A1C  by 0.71%  compared to diet and lifestyle changes alone or with a placebo.
Berberine may improve insulin sensitivity and enhance sugar uptake from your blood into your muscles, which helps lower blood sugar.
Berberine may cause digestive disturbances, such as constipation, diarrhea, or gas. Berberine may interact with several medications, so check with your doctor before taking this supplement.

6. Vitamin D
Vitamin D deficiency  is considered a potential  risk factor  for type 2 diabetes.
In one study, 72% of participants with type 2 diabetes were deficient in vitamin D at the start of the study. After two months of taking a  4,500-IU  supplement of vitamin D daily, both fasting blood sugar and A1C improved.
Vitamin D  may improve the function of pancreatic cells that make insulin and increase your body’s responsiveness to insulin.
Vitamin D may trigger mild to moderate reactions with several types of medications, so ask your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.

7. Gymnema
Gymnema Sylvestre  is an herb used as a diabetes treatment in the Ayurvedic tradition of India.
Gymnema Sylvestre  may reduce sugar absorption  in your gut and promote cells’ sugar uptake from your blood.
This herb can enhance the blood sugar effects of insulin, so use it only with a doctor’s guidance if you take insulin injections.

8. Magnesium
Low blood levels of magnesium are common in people with type 2 diabetes and are more common in those who don’t have their blood sugar under good control.
Magnesium  is involved in normal  insulin secretion and insulin action  in your body’s tissues.
Avoid magnesium oxide, which can  increase your risk  of diarrhea. Magnesium supplements may interact with several medications, such as some diuretics and antibiotics, so check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking it.

9. Alpha-Lipoic Acid
Alpha-lipoic acid , or ALA, is a vitamin-like compound and powerful antioxidant produced in your liver and found in some foods, such as spinach, broccoli, and red meat.
Taking ALA alongside prescription diabetes treatment may help decrease fasting blood sugar and A1C.
ALA may improve insulin sensitivity and your cells’ sugar uptake from your blood, though it may take a few months to experience these effects. It may also protect against oxidative damage caused by high blood sugar.
ALA may interfere with therapies for hyperthyroid or hypothyroid disease. Avoid very large doses of ALA if you have vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency or live with an alcohol use disorder.

10. Chromium
Chromium deficiency  reduces  your body’s ability to use carbs — converted into sugar — for energy and raises your insulin needs.
Chromium  may enhance  the effects of insulin or support the activity of pancreatic cells that produce insulin.
Certain drugs — such as antacids and others prescribed for heartburn — can reduce chromium absorption.

The Bottom Line
Many supplements — including cinnamon, ginseng, other herbs, vitamin D, magnesium, probiotics, and plant compounds like berberine — may help lower blood sugar.
Remember that you may experience different results than what studies have found based on factors such as duration, supplement quality, and your individual diabetes status.
Discuss supplements with your doctor, especially if you’re taking medication or insulin for diabetes, as some of the above supplements may interact with medications and raise the risk of blood sugar dropping too low.
Sometimes, your doctor may need to decrease your diabetes medication dose at some point.
Try only one new supplement at a time and check your blood sugar regularly to follow any changes over several months. Doing so will help you and your doctor determine the impact.
