Title: Top 10 Vegan Sources of Calcium

If you don’t eat animal products or dairy, there are many vegan foods that have enough calcium to help you maintain healthy levels of this important mineral. We discuss them here.
Calcium plays crucial roles in your body.
It’s well known for its ability to build and maintain your bones. Yet, this mineral is also important for muscle contraction, blood pressure regulation, nerve transmission, and blood clotting.
The Daily Value (DV) is  1,300 mg  per day. Still, a large percentage of people don’t meet these recommendations. This includes many who avoid eating animal products and dairy — though many plant foods contain this mineral.
Here are the top 10 vegan foods high in calcium.

1. Soy foods
Soybeans are naturally rich in calcium.
One cup ( 172 grams ) of cooked soybeans provides 13% of the DV%.
Foods made from soybeans, such as tofu, tempeh, and natto, are also rich in this mineral. Tofu made with calcium sulfate contains  683 mg , or 53% of the DV, per 3.5 ounces (100 grams).
Tempeh and natto — made from fermented soybeans — provide good amounts as well. One 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of tempeh covers around  7%  of the DV, whereas natto offers about  17% .
Minimally processed soy foods are also a great source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Plus, they’re one of the rare plant foods considered a complete source of protein.
That’s because — while most plant foods are low in at least one of the nine essential amino acids —  soybeans  offer good amounts of all of them.

2. Beans, peas, and lentils
In addition to being rich in fiber and protein,  beans  and lentils are good sources of calcium.
The varieties providing the highest levels of this mineral per cooked cup (about 175 grams) include:
winged (goa) beans:   19%  of the DV
white beans:   12%  of the DV
navy beans:   10%  of the DV
black beans:   8%  of the DV
chickpeas:   6%  of the DV
kidney beans:   4%  of the DV
lentils:   3%  of the DV
Moreover, beans and lentils tend to be rich in other nutrients, including iron, zinc, potassium, magnesium, and folate. However, they also contain antinutrients like phytates and lectins, which lower your body’s ability to absorb other nutrients.
Soaking, sprouting, and fermenting beans and lentils can  reduce antinutrient levels , making them more absorbable.
What’s more, diets rich in beans, peas, and lentils lower LDL (bad) cholesterol, and decrease your risk of conditions like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and premature death.

3. Certain nuts
All nuts contain small amounts of calcium, but  almonds  are especially rich — providing 96 mg per 1/4 cup, or about  7%  of the DV.
Brazil nuts are second to almonds, providing around  4%  of the DV per 1/4 cup.
Nuts are also good sources of fiber, healthy fats, and protein. What’s more, they’re rich in antioxidants and contain good amounts of B vitamins, magnesium, copper, potassium, and selenium, as well as vitamins E and K.
Eating nuts  regularly may help you lose weight, lower your blood pressure, and reduce risk factors for metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.

4. Seeds
Seeds and their butters are also good sources of calcium, but the amount they contain depends on the variety.
Tahini — a butter made from sesame seeds — contains the most, providing 128 mg per 2 tablespoons (30 g) — or  10%  of the DV. In comparison, 2 tablespoons of raw  sesame seeds  provides  14%  of the DV.
Chia seeds also contain decent amounts, providing around  14%  of the DV per ounce (28.35 grams).
Like nuts, seeds provide fiber, protein, healthy fats, vitamins, minerals, and beneficial plant compounds. Plus, they’re  linked to health benefits , such as  reduced inflammation , blood sugar levels, and risk factors for heart disease.

5. Some grains
Grains aren’t typically thought of as a source of calcium. Yet, some varieties contain significant amounts of this mineral.
For example, amaranth and teff — two  gluten-free ancient grains  — provide around  9%  of the DV per cooked cup (250 grams).
Both are rich in fiber and can be incorporated into a variety of dishes.
Teff can be made into a porridge or added to chili, while  amaranth  provides an easy substitute for rice or couscous. Both can be ground into a flour and used to thicken soups and sauces.

6. Seaweed
Adding seaweed to your diet is yet another way to increase your calcium intake.
Wakame  — a variety typically eaten raw — provides around 120 mg, or  9%  of the DV per cup (80 grams). You can find it in most Asian supermarkets or in sushi restaurants.
Kelp, which can be eaten raw or dried, is another popular option. One cup (80 grams) of raw kelp — which you can add to salads and main dishes — provides around  10%  of the DV. Dried kelp flakes can also be used as seasoning.
That said, seaweed may also contain high levels of heavy metals. Some varieties, such as kelp, can contain excessively large amounts of iodine per portion.
While iodine is needed for the proper function of your thyroid gland, getting too much can be harmful. For these reasons,  seaweed  shouldn’t be consumed too often or in large quantities.

7. Certain vegetables and leafy greens
Some vegetables — especially bitter ones like  dark leafy greens  and cruciferous vegetables — are rich in calcium.
For instance, spinach, as well as turnip, mustard, and collard greens provide  83 – 164  mg per cooked 1/2 cup (70–135 grams, depending on the variety) — or 6–13% of the DV.
That said, vegetables also contain variable levels of antinutrients, such as  oxalates . Oxalates can bind to calcium in your gut, making it more difficult for your body to absorb.
This is why low- and moderate-oxalate vegetables like turnip greens, broccoli, and kale are considered better sources than higher-oxalate vegetables, such as spinach, beet greens, and Swiss chard.
Boiling is one way to reduce oxalate levels by  30–87% . Interestingly, it appears to be more effective than steaming or baking.

8. Some fruit
Some varieties of  fruit  contain good amounts of calcium.
For instance, raw figs provide  18 mg  — or close to 1% of the DV — per fig. Dried figs offer slightly less at around  14 mg  per fig.
Oranges are another somewhat high-calcium fruit. One navel orange contains around  60 mg , or 5% of the DV per medium-sized fruit.
Blackcurrants, blackberries, and  raspberries  round off this list.
Blackcurrants pack around  62 mg  of calcium per cup (112 grams) — or around 5% of the DV — whereas raspberries and blackberries provide you with  31 – 42  mg per cup (123 grams and 144 grams, respectively).
In addition to calcium, these fruits also offer a good dose of fiber, vitamin C, and an array of other vitamins and minerals.

9. Fortified foods and drinks
Some foods and drinks have calcium added during the manufacturing process. They’re another good way to add this mineral to your diet.
Foods fortified in calcium include plant yogurts and some types of cereal. Flour and cornmeal are sometimes also enriched with this mineral, which is why some baked goods including breads, crackers, or tortillas contain large amounts.
Fortified drinks, such as  plant milks  and orange juice, can also add significant amounts of calcium to your diet.
For instance,  1 cup (249 g)  of fortified  orange juice  usually covers up to 28% of your daily requirements.
In particular, soy milk is a great alternative to cow’s milk, as it contains about the same quantity of protein — or  3.27  to  3.55  grams per 100 gram serving.
Just keep in mind that not all plant milks are fortified, so check the label before buying.

10. Blackstrap molasses
Blackstrap molasses is a sweetener with a nutritional punch.
It’s made from  sugar cane  that has been boiled three times. Unlike sugar, it contains several vitamins and minerals, including  191 mg  of calcium — or 15% of the DV — per tablespoon (21 g).
That said, blackstrap molasses remains very  high in sugar , so you should eat it in moderation.

The bottom line
Calcium  is important for the health of your bones and muscles, as well as your circulatory and nervous systems. Yet many people fail to get enough of this nutrient, including vegans.
Dairy is often thought of as the only source of this mineral. However, it’s also naturally present in an array of plant foods — from grains and legumes to fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. You’ll even find it in seaweed and blackstrap molasses.
What’s more, several foods are fortified with this nutrient. Thus, variety is key when trying to meet your calcium needs on a  vegan diet .
