Title: 42 Foods That Are Low in Calories


Reducing your calorie intake can be an effective way to lose weight.
However, not all foods are equal when it comes to nutritional value. Some foods are low in calories while also low in nutrients.
When limiting your calorie intake, it’s important to choose nutrient-dense foods, which contain ample nutrients for the number of calories they provide.
What’s more, a diet full of whole, nutrient-dense foods may help you feel more satisfied while cutting calories ( 1 ).
Here are 42 nutritious foods that are low in calories.

1–4. Meat and poultry
Because they’re high in  protein , lean meat and poultry are good foods to eat when you’re trying to cut calories.
Protein boosts feelings of fullness and may help you eat fewer calories throughout the day ( 2 ,  3 ).
Meats that are lowest in calories are the ones that are very lean. Fat is calorie-dense, so fattier cuts of meat have a higher calorie count.
There’s no reason you can’t still enjoy a steak while cutting calories. Beef is nutritious and a good source of vitamin B12 and iron ( 4 ).
Iron is an essential nutrient that helps transport oxygen throughout your body, while vitamin B12 is necessary to form red blood cells ( 5 ).
However, note that eye of round is a very lean cut of beef. Be sure not to overcook it, or it will be tough and dry.
Calories:  138 per 3-ounce (86-gram) serving
Chicken is a very versatile meat that is also an excellent  source of protein  ( 6 ).
You can keep the calorie content low by trimming all skin and visible fat.
Calories:  92 per 3-ounce (86-gram) serving
Turkey  breast is high in protein, vitamin B6, and niacin. B vitamins help your body break down the food you eat and metabolize it into energy ( 7 ).
Calories:  93 per 3-ounce (86-gram) serving
Tenderloin is one of the leanest cuts of pork, making it a great low-calorie option.
Pork is rich in several B vitamins and an excellent source of high-quality protein ( 8 ).
Calories:  122 per 3-ounce (86-gram) serving

5–8. Fish and seafood
Most  fish  and seafood are highly nutritious and excellent choices if you’re restricting calories.
Like meat, fish and seafood are high in protein. They also provide important nutrients like vitamin B12, iodine, and omega-3 fatty acids ( 9 ).
Omega-3 fatty acids have  numerous benefits , including reduced inflammation and improved heart health ( 10 ).
Cod is a lean, white fish that is high in protein but low in calories.
It’s also rich in vitamin B12, iodine, and selenium, and contains a decent amount of omega-3 fatty acids. Iodine is important for proper brain and thyroid function, but many people do not get enough of it ( 11 ,  12 ).
Calories:  70 per 3-ounce (86-gram) serving
Salmon is a fatty fish loaded with heart-healthy omega-3s. It’s also high in vitamin B12 and one of the few foods that naturally contain high amounts of  vitamin D  ( 13 ).
This is important, as  vitamin D deficiency  is a common problem around the world. It’s is associated with various health issues, such as osteoporosis, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and high blood pressure ( 14 ,  15 ).
Calories:  99 in a 3-ounce (86-gram) serving
Scallops are a low-calorie shellfish with a sweet, mild flavor ( 16 ).
Make sure to skip the high-calorie sauces and enjoy scallops steamed, broiled, or grilled.
Calories:  26 in 5 small scallops (30 grams)
Just 1 oyster provides over 100% of the daily value (DV) for vitamin B12 and over half of the DV for zinc and selenium ( 17 ).
An adequate intake of  selenium  may reduce the risk of prostate cancer in men ( 18 ).
Calories:  41 per oyster (50 grams)

9–17. Vegetables
Most vegetables are low in calories yet high in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants. This makes them excellent for  weight loss .
Many veggies are also high in both water and fiber, which help you feel full without consuming a lot of calories ( 19 ).
Starchy vegetables  like potatoes and winter squashes are higher in calories but still very nutritious.
Chinese cabbage, which includes napa and bok choy, ranks at the top of the list when it comes to nutrient density. This cabbage is high in vitamins C and K and contains a decent amount of  folate  ( 20 ).
Sautéing Chinese cabbage gives it an excellent flavor and retains its nutrients.
Calories:  12 per cup (75 grams)
Watercress  is a spicy, leafy green that’s one of the most nutrient-rich vegetables you can eat.
It’s very low in calories yet contains large amounts of vitamins A, C, and K. You can toss watercress into a salad or stir-fry it alongside other scrumptious vegetables ( 21 ).

Calories:  34 per cup (68 grams)
Spinach is high in folate,  manganese , and vitamins A, C, and K1. It’s also rich in cancer-fighting antioxidants like flavonoids and carotenoids ( 28 ).
Starting your meal with a salad made from spinach or other leafy greens might help you feel fuller and eat fewer calories overall ( 29 ).
Calories:  7 per cup (30 grams)
Bell peppers are naturally sweet and high in fiber, vitamin C, and carotenoids ( 30 ).
Carotenoids are cancer-fighting plant compounds that may also improve  eye health  ( 31 ,  32 ).
Calories:  37 per pepper (119 grams)
Mushrooms are fungi but often classified as vegetables. They contain  several B vitamins  and a good amount of potassium and selenium ( 33 ).
Certain edible mushrooms have been associated with health benefits, including a strengthened immune system, decreased inflammation, and a reduced risk of cancer ( 34 ,  35 ,  36 ).
Calories:  15 per cup (68 grams)

18–23. Fruits and berries
Fruits  tend to be higher in calories than vegetables. However, most fruits are nutrient-dense and deserve a place in your low-calorie diet.

Calories:  46 per cup (153 grams)
Blueberries  are a popular, highly nutritious fruit. They are particularly rich in antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin K1, and manganese ( 43 ).
These compounds have numerous health benefits, including a protective effect against heart disease ( 44 ,  45 ).
Calories:  84 per cup (147 grams)
Like many other citrus fruits,  grapefruits  are high in vitamin C. Red grapefruit also gets its color from the healthy plant compound lycopene ( 46 ).
Calories:  57 calories for half a fruit (136 grams)
Just one kiwifruit, without  the skin , contains all the vitamin C you need in a day. It also provides a good dose of fiber and vitamin K1 ( 47 ).
Calories:  46 per fruit (75 grams)

24–25. Legumes
Legumes are one of the best  plant-based sources of protein  and very high in nutrients.
Black beans are a versatile and inexpensive protein source.
They are very high in fiber and folate while also containing a good amount of B vitamins, iron,  magnesium , and manganese ( 48 ).
Calories:  114 calories per 1/2 cup (86 grams)
Compared to other legumes, lentils are quick and easy to prepare. They’re also high in protein, fiber, folate, thiamine, iron, potassium, and manganese ( 49 ).
What’s more, lentils contain  fiber  and protein. This makes them incredibly filling even though they’re low in calories ( 50 ).
Calories:  165 per 1/2 cup (142 grams)

26–29. Dairy and eggs
When it comes to  dairy products , the calorie count varies with the fat content.
If you’re trying to keep your calorie intake low, stick to low-fat or nonfat dairy options.
Skim milk is a low-calorie source of high-quality protein. Milk also contains calcium, and most milk manufacturers supplement their products with vitamin D ( 51 ).
Calories:  86 per cup (240 ml)
Yogurt is high in protein and calcium. Probiotic yogurts also contain live bacteria, which benefit your digestive health ( 52 ,  53 ).

Calories:  137 per cup (245 grams)
Cottage cheese  is a soft, creamy, fresh cheese that is low in calories and high in protein.

Calories:  72 per large egg (50 grams)

30–34. Grains
The healthiest grains are those that have not been processed or refined.
Fiber-rich  whole grains  may help you feel full for longer, which can help you eat fewer calories ( 50 ).
Popcorn  is a type of corn that expands and pops when it’s exposed to heat.
