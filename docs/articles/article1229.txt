Title: Methylcobalamin vs. Cyanocobalamin: What’s the Difference?

Both cyanocobalamin and methylcobalamin are forms of vitamin B12. Cyanocobalamin is synthetic while methylcobalamin is natural. But the body can convert synthetic forms into natural ones.
Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is an important water-soluble vitamin involved in red blood cell production, brain health, and DNA synthesis ( 1 ).
A deficiency in this key vitamin can cause serious symptoms, including fatigue, nerve damage, digestive issues, and neurological problems like depression and memory loss ( 1 ).
Therefore, many people turn to vitamin B12 supplements to help meet their needs and prevent a deficiency.
This article examines the main differences between methylcobalamin and cyanocobalamin — two of the most common sources of vitamin B12 found in supplements.

Synthetic vs. Natural
Vitamin B12 supplements are typically derived from two sources: cyanocobalamin or methylcobalamin.
Both are nearly identical and contain a cobalt ion surrounded by a corrin ring.
However, each have a different molecule attached to the cobalt ion. While methylcobalamin contains a methyl group, cyanocobalamin contains a cyanide molecule.
Cyanocobalamin is a synthetic form of vitamin B12 that’s not found in nature ( 2 ).
It’s used more frequently in supplements, as it’s considered more stable and cost effective than other forms of vitamin B12.
When cyanocobalamin enters your body, it’s converted into either methylcobalamin or adenosylcobalamin, which are the two active forms of vitamin B12 in humans ( 1 ).
Unlike cyanocobalamin, methylcobalamin is a naturally occurring form of vitamin B12 that can be obtained through supplements, as well as food sources like  fish , meat,  eggs , and milk ( 3 ,  4 ).
Cyanocobalamin is a synthetic form of vitamin B12 found only in supplements, while methylcobalamin is a naturally occurring form that you can get through either food sources or supplements.

May be absorbed and retained differently
Another major difference between methylcobalamin and cyanocobalamin is the way they’re absorbed and retained within your body.
Some studies suggest that your body may absorb cyanocobalamin slightly better than methylcobalamin.
In fact, one study found that people’s bodies absorbed about 49% of a 1-mcg dose of cyanocobalamin, compared to 44% of the same dose of methylcobalamin ( 5 ).
Conversely, another study comparing the two forms reported that about three times as much cyanocobalamin was excreted through urine, indicating that methylcobalamin may be retained better within your body ( 6 ).
However, some research suggests that differences in bioavailability between the two forms may be insignificant and that absorption could be influenced by factors such as  age  and genetics ( 7 ,  8 ).
Unfortunately, recent research directly comparing these two forms of  vitamin B12  is limited.
Additional studies are needed to measure the absorption and retention of methylcobalamin versus cyanocobalamin in healthy adults.
Research shows that cyanocobalamin may be absorbed better in your body, while methylcobalamin likely has a higher retention rate. Other studies have found that the differences in absorption and retention are minimal.

Both methylcobalamin and cyanocobalamin can be converted to other forms of vitamin B12
When you ingest cyanocobalamin, it can be converted to both of the active forms of vitamin B12, methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin.
Much like methylcobalamin, adenosylcobalamin is essential to many aspects of your health.
It’s involved in the metabolism of fats and  amino acids , as well as the formation of myelin, which creates a protective sheath around your nerve cells ( 9 ).
Deficiencies in both forms of vitamin B12 can increase your risk of neurological issues and adverse side effects ( 10 ).
Both cyanocobalamin and methylcobalamin are reduced to a cobalamin molecule that’s converted to the active forms of this vitamin within the cells of the body ( 11 ).
Some researchers recommended treating vitamin B12 deficiencies with either cyanocobalamin or a combination of methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin due to distinct properties of these latter two forms ( 9 ).
While they differ in some aspects, both cyanocobalamin and methylcobalamin can be converted to other forms of cobalamin within the body.

Both forms have health benefits
Although distinct differences exist between methylcobalamin and cyanocobalamin, both have beneficial effects on health and can prevent B12 deficiencies ( 12 ).
In fact, one study found that treating seven B12-deficient people with oral methylcobalamin normalized vitamin B12 levels in their blood within just 2 months ( 13 ).
Similarly, another study showed that taking cyanocobalamin capsules for 3 months also increased vitamin B12 levels in 10 people with  pernicious anemia , a condition caused by impaired B12 absorption ( 14 ).
Both types of the vitamin may also provide other health benefits.
One review of seven studies showed that both methylcobalamin and a  vitamin B-complex  containing cyanocobalamin were effective in reducing symptoms of diabetic neuropathy, a complication of diabetes that leads to nerve damage ( 15 ).
Additionally, several animal studies have found that each form could have neuroprotective effects and may be beneficial in treating conditions that affect your nervous system ( 16 ,  17 ).
Both methylcobalamin and cyanocobalamin can treat vitamin B12 deficiency. Animal and human studies have found that they could reduce symptoms of diabetic neuropathy and may have neuroprotective effects as well.

The bottom line
If you think you may have a vitamin B12 deficiency, talk to your doctor to determine the best course of treatment.
However, if you’re just looking to fill in the nutritional gaps in your diet, a vitamin B12 supplement may help.
Cyanocobalamin is a synthetic form of vitamin B12 that can be converted to the natural forms methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin.
The body may absorb cyanocobalamin better, while methylcobalamin has a higher retention rate.
Both can prevent B12 deficiency, but methylcobalamin should be combined with adenosylcobalamin for best results.
Regardless of which form of vitamin B12 you choose, be sure to combine it with a healthy,  well-balanced diet  to meet your nutritional needs and  optimize your health .
