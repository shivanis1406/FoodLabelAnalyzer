Title: Move Over, Beyond Burger: Fishless Fish is Making a Splash On Grocery Store Shelves

You probably remember the classic  Forrest Gump  scene where Bubba Blue hails shrimp as the ultimate versatile food of the sea.
You can barbecue it, broil it, bake it, sautee it, put it on shrimp kabobs…you get the point.
More and more these days, people are barbecuing, broiling, baking, and sauteeing fishless fish.
What was once a pie—or crab cake?—in the sky idea has hooked venture capitalists, sustainability experts, celebrities, and animal-cruelty advocates alike.
“[We’re] out to disrupt the fishing industry with plant-based seafood products,” says Jacek Prus, co-founder and CEO of  Current Foods , a plant-based seafood company founded in 2019.
Does fishless fish live up to its early hype in terms of health, taste, and sustainability? Read on to find out.

What is fishless fish?
Broadly speaking, fishless fish is seafood that doesn’t require fish farming or catching any fish.
Plant-based:  Plant-based fish is imitation fish that’s usually made from soy, gluten, or other plant-based ingredients.
Cell-cultivated:  There’s also cell-cultivated seafood made in a lab. No ocean required—just science and a recipe.
Jonathan Deutsch , Ph.D., CHE, CRC, professor and director at Drexel University’s Food Lab, says this lab-grown version involves cultivating fish in a lab by taking tiny, needle-sized samples of cells.
Scientists feed these cells liquid vitamins, amino acids, and sugars. The cells multiply and eventually become the fatty and lean parts of seafood.
It goes by many different names, including “cell-based” or “cell-cultured” seafood.
Apparently, the public likes the first option.  A 2021 study  suggests that “cell-based seafood” outperformed “cell-cultured seafood” based on the perceptions of 1,200 adult participants.
“It’ll be fascinating to see how cultural perceptions evolve,” says  Denneal Jamison-McClung, Ph.D ., director of the UC Davis Biotechnology Program and co-organizer of the Cultivated Meat Consortium
Robert Downey, Jr. and Leonardo DiCaprio are among the investors in  Wildtype , a pioneer in lab-grown fish. Additionally,  BluNalu’s $60 million  in funding turned heads in 2021.
Whether these seafood cultures are vegan or vegetarian or not is up for debate.
“I don’t think they are technically vegan, though, from a philosophical standpoint, vegans and vegetarians may find these products more acceptable than traditionally produced meat,” says Jamison-McClung.
Regardless, the aim of both is to satisfy more than seafood cravings.
“Fish is a high-value commodity that’s expensive to farm raise or harvest from the ocean,” Deutsch says.
Experts are concerned about the sustainability of fisheries because of climate change, over-fishing, and environmental contaminants—like microplastics—harming fish.

In 2018 , the World Economic Forum declared that almost 90 percent of the world’s fish stocks have diminished, citing overfishing as the primary culprit.
Fishless fish looks to fill these gaps, now and in the future.
“Companies are exploring alternatives to fish…including growing the tissue, making fish analogs from other proteins like plants, and even flavoring fruits and vegetables to provide an eating experience similar to eating fish,” Deutsch says. “For example, a tomato fillet can be infused with flavors and look and taste a bit like raw tuna in a sushi application.”

Ingredients in fishless fish
Different brands of plant-based fish have different recipes, but they may include:
In the case of cell-based seafood, the ingredients are simple: Cells from a fish, potentially with some plant-based protein for texture, says  Maddie Pasquariello , MS, RD.
Take a look at the nutrition facts and 27 ingredients in  Gardein’s f’ish filet .
Nutrition facts
Ingredients

What’s it taste like?
It depends on who you ask and your tastebuds.
One  Forbes  reviewer  shared that Wildtype’s sushi-grade salmon tasted like the real thing.
Lab-grown meat  first got the go-ahead from the FDA with brand Upside’s cell-cultured chicken. That said, lab-grown, cell-cultivated fish has not officially hit shelves, and Jamison-McClung said the best timeline she could give is “likely soon.”
However, plant-based options have already been tried and tasted by consumers.
Reviewers noted  that Quorn’s fishless fingers tasted similar to actual fish fingers.  Ditto for Aldi’s .  Tesco’s  fish-free cakes garnered similar comments.
Reviewers called Gardein’s plant-based fish filets  “delicious” and “full of flavor and texture.”
The  Battered Fish Goujons from M&S  had a more subtle flavor, though some reviewers said the mushy texture was a miss.
Each option had detractors who didn’t think the flavor was as spot-on as the other glowing reviews. In the end, it may be best to taste it and decide for yourself.

What are the health benefits of fishless fish?
Fishless fish is a relatively new commodity, but experts share that it can provide health benefits for consumers.
The potential health benefits of fishless fish may include:
fewer contaminants like high levels of mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls
a safe option for people allergic to fish
higher fiber
“Health-wise, the nutritional composition of cell-cultivated fish is similar [to fish] but is less likely to have environmental contaminants like high levels of mercury that can accrue in larger predatory fish,” Deutsch says.
Pasquariello says this benefit extends to plant-based fish, too. She adds that people can avoid polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), or toxic industrial contaminants that fish ingest, by consuming plant-based fish.
Pasquariello notes that PCBs are more common in bottom-feeding fish like striped bass and bluefish. Farm-raised fish like salmon, particularly those fed bottom-feeding fish, are more likely to have this contamination.
The  Environmental Protection Agency  banned PCBs in 1979, citing cancer and birth defects in exposed laboratory animals and potential carcinogenic effects in humans.
Still, Pasquariello and older  research from 2010 suggest  PCBs are still found in fish.
“They don’t break down for a long time in the environment and can remain in the water and sediment for years,” Pasquariello says.
Since cell-cultivated fish contain fish cells, people allergic to seafood would have reactions when consuming it. However, Deutsch says plant-based options are on the table.
And fish allergies are common.
A 2016 systematic review  of 61 studies indicated that fish allergy prevalence ranged from 0 to 7 percent of allergy types, with shellfish allergies ranging from 0 to 10.3 percent.
Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE) estimates  that fish allergies affect 1 percent of the U.S. population.
Fiber  is an important part of a healthy diet. However, fresh fish doesn’t contain any.
On the other hand, plant-based fishless fish does! For instance, Gardein’s frozen fishless fish filet mentioned above offers 2 grams, or 7 percent of the daily recommended value.

What are the sustainability benefits of fishless fish?
Sustainability is an oft-cited benefit of plant-based and cell-cultivated fish. Truthfully, the jury is still out on it.
“There are ongoing discussions about the energy, water, and natural resource requirements to produce different types of protein,” Jamison-McClung says. “However, we’ll only be able to validate sustainability models once cultivated meat facilities have been scaled up and are producing meat for consumers.”
Generally, plant-based diets are associated with environmental benefits. Fishless fish may be new, but animal protein substitutes are not.
A  2014 study  indicated dietary greenhouse gas emissions were two times higher in meat eaters than vegans. The authors indicated that reducing meat consumption would lower dietary greenhouse gas emissions.
However, dietary greenhouse gas emissions make up a relatively low percentage of overall emissions.
Research from 2021  indicates that seafood alternatives don’t contribute to overfishing, and  research from 2020  suggests that plant-based meat requires about 41 percent less land than fish farming.
Still, “vegan” and “vegetarian” don’t always equal “green” and “sustainable.”
Soy is commonly used in fishless fish, and while it may reduce carbon emissions, reports, an  older 2010 study  said that growing soybeans might be indirectly linked with deforestation in the Amazon.

What are the animal welfare benefits of fishless fish?
Jamison-McClung shares that, while cell-cultivated fish may blur the line between what’s vegan, it provides animal cruelty advocates with a more viable option. Ditto for plant-based fish, which is often vegan, but it may have eggs, and at least vegetarian.
“Many proponents of cultivated meat are concerned about animal welfare and would prefer not to eat meat that is derived from slaughtered animals,” Jamison-McClung says.
How much would depend on how quickly fishless fish catches on.
A  2021 Good Food Institute report  indicated that plant-based seafood made up 0.1 percent of the seafood market in the U.S.

Downsides to fishless fish
Fishless fish may be buzzy, but there are some factors to keep in mind.
Like meatless meat options, the quality of fishless fish varies. Some options may be highly-processed or not on par with regular fish from a health standpoint.
“If the goal is to avoid eating fish and eat healthfully and sustainably, the best way to do that is through eating sustainably-produced plants: fruit, vegetables, and whole grains,” Deutsch says. “If the goal is to have an experience similar to fish, but without the fish, there is likely to be a complexity of ingredients required to achieve that.”
He added that some products might include breading and frying to mask differences in taste and texture, which increases fat and cholesterol content.
Pasquariello adds that sodium content might be higher in fishless fish.
Deutsch says that the plant-based fish options are comparable to regular fish.
Gardein’s f’sh filets are  $7.81 a pound at Walmart  at the time of writing. Compare  whole tilapia  at $4.41 per pound or  skinless Atlantic salmon  at $9.97 per pound.
In other words, plant-based fish is a steal for people who may have otherwise gotten salmon but not so much if they would’ve preferred tilapia.
Further, it remains to be seen whether or not people will be priced out of cell-cultivated seafood.
Though fishless fish may have lower cholesterol and mercury,  Shena Jaramillo MS, RD  says it may also skimp on other important factors, like protein and omega-3 fatty acids.
For example,  3 ounces of salmon  has 17.3 grams of protein compared to Gardein’s 9 grams.
That’s just below what Pasquariello recommends.
“I always look for at least 10g protein per serving in these products,” she says.

Frequently asked questions about fishless fish
Have more questions? Get the facts below.
Like Bubba said about shrimp, there are countless variations of fishless fish, like fishless fish fingers, fishless fish cakes, and fishless fish filets. Fishless fish could be entirely plant-based or made from actual fish cells grown in a lab.
Wildtype is one of the pioneering brands in that space and counts Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert Downey, Jr. among its investors. Plant-based fish (think Beyond Burger for seafood) is made by brands like Gardein, Tesco, and Aldi.
Jaramillo says you can find plant-based fishless fish in chain stores, including Target, Aldi, Walmart, ShopRite, and Stop & Shop. Cell-cultivated fish is not available to consumers yet.
Fishless fish usually comes precooked and frozen. Cook it in the oven, on the stove, or in a microwave.
“Since most fishless fish is pre-cooked, the nice thing about fishless fish over regular fish is that it really just needs to be heated up,” Jaramillo says.
Fishless fish is a relatively new commodity.  In 2002 , scientists shared the results of an attempt to culture fish as a means of providing astronauts with a viable protein source. They concluded that cell-cultured fish fillets were a promising healthy option.
It depends on your individual taste. The cell-cultivated fish have not hit shelves yet, but experts believe brands like Wildtype and BluNalu are close to creating a product people can consume.
Other brands, like Current Foods, Bird’s Eye, and Gardein, have created products that some reviewers swear taste like real seafood.

Takeaway
Fishless fish refers to two separate seafood alternatives. The first is truly plant-based fish, which is usually vegetarian and even vegan. This fish often uses items like egg whites and soy to create a product that has a similar taste and texture to fish.
The second refers seafood grown in a lab using actual fish cells. It’s still being developed, but experts say companies like Wildtype are close to getting it on store shelves.
In both cases, fishless fish may be a win for health and sustainability, though not all options are created equally.
