Title: Benefits, Side Effects, and Dosage of TMG Supplements

TMG supplements may help improve heart health, boost athletic performance, and regulate insulin levels. Taking up to 15 grams per day may be safe, but some side effects may include diarrhea and vomiting.
Trimethylglycine (TMG), also known as betaine or betaine anhydrous, is an  important  anti-inflammatory and antioxidative compound that your body can produce by itself.
It’s found in foods like beetroot and is also available in supplements.
TMG consists of glycine with  three  attached methyl groups. It’s involved in a chemical process called  methylation , which is essential for DNA production.
It’s important to note that TMG may cause side effects, especially if used in high doses.
This article covers TMG benefits, side effects, dosage, and how to increase your intake with food.

Potential benefits
TMG supplements may be associated with several health benefits.
Some  research  shows that TMG could help convert homocysteine, a type of amino acid, into another compound called  methionine . This is beneficial since  high levels  of homocysteine  may increase  the risk of heart disease.
A  2021 review  found that taking up to 4 grams (g) of TMG per day helped lower homocysteine levels without negatively impacting other aspects of heart health, like blood pressure and triglyceride levels.
That said, other research found that TMG supplements may  slightly increase  total and  LDL (bad) cholesterol  levels in the blood, both of which are risk factors for heart disease.
Ultimately, more research is needed on how these supplements may affect heart health.
Many athletes use TMG supplements with the aim of enhancing exercise performance.
A  2021 study  in 29 soccer players found that taking 2 g of TMG supplements for 14 weeks improved muscular strength, running speed, and ability to repeat sprints.
Although the exact mechanisms are unclear, researchers from a  2014 review  speculate that TMG may:
reduce fatigue
boost protein production
increase the synthesis of  creatine , a compound that provides energy to your muscle cells
Despite the potential benefits of TMG supplements for athletic performance, research is mixed.
A  2017 review  of seven studies found that only two studies found benefits of TMG supplementation for muscle strength and power.
Similarly, a  2020 study  found no significant effects of taking TMG supplements for cross-fit training performance.
More studies are needed before experts can confidently recommend TMG supplements to boost athleticism.
Several studies have found that TMG supplements may improve  insulin resistance , a condition that  affects  your body’s ability to use the hormone insulin to regulate blood sugar levels.
A  2017 study  in nearly 2,400 people associated a higher intake of  choline  and betaine with decreased insulin resistance.
Plus, in a  2018 animal study , administering TMG supplements to mice on a high fat diet improved fat metabolism and decreased insulin resistance.
Still, more research is needed to better understand how TMG may affect insulin resistance in humans.
Some research shows that TMG supplements may improve how well certain types of  antidepressant medications  work.
In particular, TMG has  been shown  to increase the effects of  S-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe) , a type of medication used to treat mild to moderate depression.
In a  2015 study  including 64 people with  depression , those who took both SAMe and TMG for 12 months experienced greater improvement in their symptoms than those who took SAMe alone.
What’s more, TMG supplements may also help improve symptoms of depression and anxiety. These conditions may be  linked  with elevated homocysteine levels that TMG could help lower.

Potential side effects
The most common side effects associated with TMG supplements are digestive issues,  including :
diarrhea
indigestion
bloating
cramps
nausea
vomiting
These are more common if you’re taking higher doses of the supplement.
In rare cases, TMG could also significantly increase the amount of methionine in your blood, which could cause fluid buildup around the brain.
If you experience any side effects from taking this supplement, discontinue use and speak with a doctor.
TMG supplements are not recommended for children and people who are pregnant or nursing, as there’s limited research on their safety and long-term effects on health.

Dosage
There are no official dosage recommendations for TMG supplements, but most products provide 750 to 3,000 milligrams (mg) of TMG per serving.
TMG is considered safe when used in doses of up to  20 g per day .
Most studies on the potential benefits of TMG supplements in humans have used amounts of  500 to 9,000 mg  per day, typically divided into several smaller doses.
If you have any underlying health conditions or are taking other medications, talk with a doctor before taking a TMG supplement and use them only as directed.

Other ways to increase your intake
You can increase your intake of TMG naturally, as it’s found in many foods.
Here’s the amount of TMG found in a 3.5-ounce (100-g) serving of several foods, as per  research from 2004 :
Wheat bran:  1,339 mg
Wheat germ:  1,241 mg
Spinach:  600 to 645 mg
Quinoa:  390 mg
Beets:  114 to 297 mg
Shrimp:  219 mg
Wheat bread:  201 mg
Several factors may impact the amount of TMG in foods. Certain cooking methods, particularly boiling, significantly decrease the TMG content.

Frequently asked questions
TMG supplements may help improve heart health, athletic performance, insulin levels, and the effectiveness of certain antidepressants.
Research  suggests that TMG may have anti-inflammatory compounds.
Some  research  suggests low levels of TMG are associated with poor sleep quality. However, more research is needed to fully explore the link between TMG supplements and sleep.
No research recommends taking TMG specifically in the morning or at night. However, some  research  has shown potential benefits when taking TMG in divided doses, so it may have to be taken in the morning and evening.

Takeaway
TMG is a compound produced by your body and found in supplements and certain foods.
Although more research is needed, some studies in humans and animals suggest it may have anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties that could provide many benefits.
Remember, speak with a healthcare professional before taking TMG supplements if you have a medical condition like heart disease, depression, or insulin resistance. More research on the benefits is needed.
