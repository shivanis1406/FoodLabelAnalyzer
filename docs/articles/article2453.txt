How to follow the Korean Weight Loss Diet
The Korean Weight Loss Diet is based around an eating pattern that mostly comprises traditional Korean meals.
It promotes eating whole, minimally-processed foods while limiting your intake of overly processed ones. It also recommends avoiding foods containing wheat,  dairy , refined sugars, and excess fat.
Meals generally contain a variety of vegetables, rice, and some meat, fish, or seafood. You can also expect to eat plenty of kimchi, a fermented cabbage dish that’s a staple in Korean cuisine.
To succeed on this diet, you’re encouraged to follow a few additional rules:
Eat fewer calories.  This diet doesn’t specify portion sizes or a strict daily calorie limit. Instead, it suggests relying on Korean recipes, soups, and plenty of vegetables to  cut calories  without feeling hungry.
Exercise regularly.  K-pop workouts are provided for this purpose.
Eat less fat.  It’s recommended to limit oily foods and avoid sauces, oils, and seasonings whenever possible. Eating out should be limited as well.
Minimize added sugars.  You’re encouraged to replace  soda  with water and cookies, sweets, ice cream, and other baked goods with fresh fruit.
Avoid snacks.  Snacks are considered unnecessary on this diet and should be avoided.
The diet promises to be very flexible and sustainable. You’re encouraged to select whichever Korean foods you like best to tailor the diet to your taste.
The Korean Weight Loss Diet encourages eating Korean-inspired dishes based on minimally processed foods. To optimize weight loss, it minimizes your intake of wheat, dairy, added sugars, excess fats, and snacks.

Can it help you lose weight?
The Korean Weight Loss Diet likely aids weight loss for several reasons.
First, traditional Korean meals are naturally  rich in vegetables , which contain a lot of fiber. Fiber-rich diets can help you lose weight by reducing hunger and cravings while promoting feelings of fullness ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
Additionally, this diet limits snacking, fatty foods, and those containing added sugars, wheat, or dairy, further reducing your overall calorie intake. It also encourages regular exercise, which helps boost the number of calories you burn.
Finally, you’re encouraged to  reduce your portion sizes  by gradually eating less until you find the quantity of food that allows you to lose weight while still feeling full and satisfied.
All of these factors can help you eat fewer calories than you burn. Such calorie deficits have consistently been shown to help people lose weight, regardless of the foods they choose to eat ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
The Korean Weight Loss Diet is naturally rich in fiber, limits snacking, and reduces sugar- and fat-rich foods. It also encourages regular physical activity. Together, these factors are likely to help you lose weight.

Other benefits
The Korean Weight Loss Diet may offer several additional benefits.
The Korean Weight Loss Diet encourages you to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables — two food groups consistently shown to promote health and protect against chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease ( 8 ,  9 ).
What’s more, it includes a lot of kimchi, a popular Korean side dish made from fermented cabbage or other vegetables. Research indicates that kimchi may help lower blood pressure, blood sugar, and total and LDL (bad)  cholesterol levels  ( 10 ,  11 ).
Fermented foods like kimchi also benefit gut health by boosting your number of beneficial gut bacteria, also known as probiotics ( 12 ).
In turn, these probiotics may help prevent or treat a range of illnesses, including atopic dermatitis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), diarrhea, and obesity ( 13 ).
The Korean Weight Loss diet is said to  help fight acne  by limiting your intake of dairy. There may be some evidence to support this claim.
Dairy appears to stimulate the release of insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), both of which may play a role in the formation of acne ( 14 ,  15 ,  16 ).
One review noted that people whose diets were richest in dairy were around 2.6 times likelier to experience acne than those eating the least amount of dairy ( 17 ).
Similarly, another review suggests that adolescents and young adults consuming any form of dairy may be 25% more likely to experience acne than those eating dairy-free diets ( 18 ).
The Korean Weight Loss Diet puts a strong emphasis on making sustainable, long-term changes to the way you eat and exercise.
It generally promotes nutritious, minimally processed foods and limits your intake of calorie-dense yet nutrient-poor  junk foods .
It doesn’t have strict guidelines on how much to eat, nor does it suggest weighing or measuring your food portions. Instead, it encourages you to discover the portion sizes that are right for you.
It also offers a variety of Korean recipes to choose from, including vegetarian,  vegan , and gluten-free options, making this diet accessible to many.
All of these factors contribute to this diet’s high nutrient content and increase the likelihood that you’ll be able to stick to it long term.
The Korean Weight Loss Diet encourages making sustainable changes. It promotes nutritious and fermented foods that can benefit your health. It also limits dairy, which may offer some protection against acne.

Potential downsides
Despite its many positives, the Korean Weight Loss Diet comes with some downsides.
This diet puts a strong emphasis on losing weight to look like your favorite K-pop celebrities.
Using sociocultural appearance standards as weight loss motivation may put certain groups of people, such as young adolescents, at an increased risk of developing  disordered eating behaviors  ( 19 ,  20 ).
This diet offers very little guidance in terms of how to build balanced meals.
While some may view the flexibility to choose whichever meals appeal to them most as a benefit, others may find it difficult to distinguish nutrient-rich Korean recipes from nutrient-poor ones.
This may cause some people to select  overly salty recipes  or ones that fail to meet their daily nutrient needs.
The Korean Weight Loss Diet recommends you  avoid snacks , despite research showing that some people lose more weight when including snacks in their diet ( 21 ,  22 ).
What’s more, the meal plans and recipe suggestions offered on its website often contain foods or ingredients that the diet suggests avoiding, such as fried foods, wheat, and dairy.
The Korean Weight Loss Diet’s strong emphasis on external appearance, lack of guidance, and non-science-based and contradictory guidelines can be considered downsides.

Foods to eat
The Korean Weight Loss diet encourages you to eat the following foods:
Vegetables.  No vegetables are off-limits. You can eat them raw, cooked, or  fermented , such as in the case of kimchi. Soups are another great way to eat more vegetables.
Fruit.  All types of fruit are allowed. They’re considered a great natural substitute for sweets.
Protein-rich animal products.  This category includes  eggs , meat, fish, and seafood. Small portions should be added to most meals.
Meat substitutes.  Tofu, dried shiitake, and king oyster mushrooms are most often used to replace meat in Korean recipes. They can make Korean recipes suitable for vegetarian or vegan diets.
Rice.  White rice and rice noodles are included in many of the Korean recipes promoted on this diet.
Other wheat-free grains.  Dumplings, pancakes, or glass noodles made from mung bean, potato, or  tapioca  starch constitute great alternatives to rice.
You’re encouraged to determine your portion sizes based on the amount of food that helps you lose weight without feeling overly hungry or low on energy.
