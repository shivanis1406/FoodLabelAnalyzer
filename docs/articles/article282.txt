Title: Acidic Foods and their Health Effects

Eating acidic foods such as processed meats and citrus is unlikely to change your body’s pH balance. However, research shows that a balanced diet prioritizing plant-based foods is best for overall health.
Your body tightly regulates its  pH balance  through a variety of mechanisms that involve multiple organs like your kidneys and lungs.
Although your diet may affect the pH of your urine,  research  generally suggests that consuming acidic or alkaline foods is unlikely to affect the pH level of your blood significantly.
In fact, increased levels of acid in the blood  usually suggest  an underlying health issue like diabetes that’s not well managed, lung disease, or kidney problems.
Still, some people may choose to limit foods high in acid to reduce their  potential renal acid load (PRAL) , which refers to the amount of acid your body produces from the foods you eat. The higher the PRAL rating, the more acid you produce upon digestion.
Research has found  that reducing PRAL aids in preserving kidney function and also that the Western diet can exacerbate metabolic acidosis.

What is acidity?
The pH value tells you whether something is an acid, a base, or neutral.
A pH of 0 indicates a high level of acidity.
A pH of 7 is neutral.
A pH of 14 is the most basic, or alkaline.
The distance between two points on the pH scale represents a tenfold difference in the acidity or alkalinity of a substance. A pH of 6 is ten times more acidic than a pH of 7, and so on.
For example, battery acid is extremely acidic at 0, while liquid drain cleaner is very alkaline at 14. Pure distilled water is in the middle at 7. It’s neither acidic nor alkaline.
Just like different substances, different parts of the human body have different pH levels.
Your  ideal blood pH  is between  7.35 and 7.45 , which is slightly alkaline. Your stomach is typically acidic at a pH of 3.5, which helps to break down food properly.

High acid food and drink
Foods considered acidic generally have a pH level of 4.6 or lower.
But the pH of food before you eat it is less important than the amount of acid or alkaline produced with digestion and metabolism of that food.
Excessive phosphorus and proteins over a long period of time can contribute to the development of metabolic acidosis. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that protein should be  10-30%  of your total calories.
Foods that tend to cause more acidity in the body if consumed chronically and in excess  include :
certain  dairy products , including cheese
fish and  seafood
high sodium  processed foods
fresh meats and  processed meats , such as corned beef and turkey
certain starchy foods, such as brown rice, oat flakes, or  granola
carbonated beverages, such as soda, seltzer, or spritzers
high protein foods  and supplements with animal protein
In general, fruits and vegetables are more alkalizing. Including them in a diverse diet full of fruits and vegetables will help prevent the overconsumption of animal protein and prevent the risk of developing metabolic acidosis.

Fruits high in acid
Although most types of fruit are acidic, they’re considered alkalizing, meaning they actually help reduce acid levels in your body.
This also means that they have a negative PRAL. The more negative the PRAL, the more it reduces the amount of acid in your body during digestion.
Here is the PRAL for a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) portion of  several popular fruits :
limes : -0.4
blueberries : -0.6
blackberries : -1.0
pineapples : -1.1
peaches : -1.5
oranges : -1.6
plums : -1.7
apples : -1.8
tomatoes : -1.8
purple  grapes : -1.9
green grapes: -2.4
bananas : -5.2
pomegranates : -8.1
raisins : -9.0
Keep in mind that although these fruits are alkalizing in the body, their initial acidity could worsen symptoms for those with upper gastrointestinal issues like  reflux .
In fact, doctors often advise people with conditions like  gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)  to limit their intake of acidic foods,  including citrus fruits  like oranges, grapefruit, lemons, and limes.

Fresh vegetables
Like fruits, vegetables are also alkalizing and can help reduce acid levels in the body.
Here is the PRAL for a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of  some common vegetables :
shiitake mushrooms  (cooked): -0.2
artichoke  (cooked): -0.5
zucchini  (cooked): -0.6
arugula  (raw): -1.1
white  cabbage  (raw): -1.5
spinach  (raw): -1.5
potato  (cooked): -1.7
pumpkin  (cooked): -1.9
cucumber  (raw): -2.0
kale  (raw): -2.6
radish  (raw): -4.7
beets  (raw): -5.4

Drinks high in acid
You may choose to avoid drinks high in  phosphorus , such as beer or hot chocolate made from packets of cocoa mix. If you do wish to drink alcohol, go with lower phosphorus red or white wine.
Carbonic acid, which is present in all carbonated beverages, contributes to your total body acid. This includes not only soft drinks but also spritzers. The same acidity  can also damage  your teeth.
If you want to lower your acidity, regular or filtered tap water is best.

Low acid foods
When it comes to the benefits of a more alkaline diet,  current research  says it can be helpful to preserve bone and muscle, and is especially beneficial for individuals with reduced kidney function.
In addition, it  may help  limit muscle loss, strengthen memory and alertness, and help you live longer.
Some alkalizing (or neutral) foods and beverages you can incorporate into your diet include:
soy , such as  miso ,  soybeans ,  tofu , and  tempeh
yogurt  and milk
most fresh vegetables, including potatoes
most fruits
herbs and spices, excluding salt, mustard, and nutmeg
beans and  lentils
some whole grains, such as  millet ,  quinoa , and  amaranth
herbal teas
fats like  olive oil ,  avocados , nuts, and seeds

Effects of eating too many acid-producing foods
A diet that includes too many acid-producing foods, such as animal proteins, some cheeses, and carbonated beverages, can cause  acidity in your urine . This can cause  uric acid stones  (a type of  kidney stone ) to form.
Some experts  have speculated that too much acidity over a long period of time can also cause bone deterioration. This is because bones contain  calcium , which your body uses to restore your blood’s pH balance when it becomes too acidic.
However, keep in mind that research has turned up conflicting results on how acidic foods may affect bone health due to the variations in total diet among test subjects.
Some evidence suggests that  phosphoric acid , commonly found in darker sodas, is linked to lower bone density when it replaces milk, a calcium- and protein-rich beverage.
A  2017 research review  notes that long term intake of a overly acidic diet can contribute to low-grade  acidosis . The authors state even a small reduction in pH over long periods can have negative health effects, such as:
high blood pressure
type 2 diabetes
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
Other research suggests that too much acidity may also increase your it’s for  cancer  and  heart disease .

Prevention
You don’t need to eliminate acidic foods from your diet to safeguard your health.
Consuming moderate amounts of acid-producing foods as part of a  healthy, balanced diet  with plenty of alkalizing fruits and vegetables is unlikely to cause muscle and bone loss or increase your risk of chronic disease.
Consuming more alkaline foods may help you better achieve nutritional goals as established in the  2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans . According to  research from 2023 , people who consume a diet with a negative PRAL (meaning it’s more alkaline) meet more nutritional goals than those on a diet with a positive PRAL (more acidic).
Research from 2022  also recommends consuming less salt and carbonated beverages.

Frequently asked questions
A diet that’s too acidic often  doesn’t present any symptoms . Most of the potential negative health effects build up over the long term.
Symptoms of acidosis usually indicate an underlying health condition. Such symptoms  include :
rapid heart rate
headaches
fatigue
confusion
nausea and vomiting
Aim to  limit these foods  since they may affect your  acid-base balance  or your health in negative ways:
salt
high sodium condiments, such as soy sauce, steak sauce, barbecue sauce, and some salad dressings
soft drinks
highly processed meats
certain types of cheese, including mozzarella, Parmesan, and brie
Follow a well balanced diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, whole grains, lean meats (fish, poultry, unprocessed red meat) and plant based proteins.
Eating a balanced diet with a focus on low PRAL foods  may be better  for your overall health. But an  alkaline diet  can limit healthy foods while not having much effect on your body’s pH.

The bottom line
Because your body closely regulates its pH balance through a series of complicated mechanisms, following an alkaline diet is unlikely to significantly affect the blood pH levels of most healthy adults.
Still, eating a well-rounded diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats is a great way to help balance your dietary acid load and support overall health.
