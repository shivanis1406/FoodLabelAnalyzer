Title: Can Probiotics Help Treat Diarrhea?

Probiotics are beneficial microorganisms that have been shown to offer a wide array of health benefits.
As such,  probiotic supplements and probiotic-rich foods  have become popular natural treatments for a number of health conditions, including digestive issues like diarrhea.
Diarrhea has a number of  different causes , including bacterial or viral infections, certain medications, and exposure to different microorganisms from traveling.
Research  has shown that different types of diarrhea may respond well to probiotic supplements.
This article explains how probiotics may help combat diarrhea, reviews which strains are the most effective, and addresses the possible side effects associated with probiotic use.

Should I take probiotics when I have diarrhea?
In addition to being found in supplements and  certain foods , probiotics naturally reside in your gut. They  play  several important roles there, such as maintaining immune health and protecting your body from infection and disease.
Whether you should consider trying probiotics for diarrhea depends on the type of diarrhea you have and the advice of your doctor.
Generally, they’re more likely to help if the cause of your diarrhea is related to the bacteria in your gut—collectively known as the gut microbiota. These bacteria can be affected negatively and positively by various factors, including diet, stress, and medication use.
When  gut bacteria composition becomes imbalanced  and the normal population of probiotics is disrupted, it can lead to negative health effects, such as an  increased risk  of conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and digestive symptoms like diarrhea.
Supplementing with probiotics  may help  reduce this risk by repopulating and maintaining beneficial gut bacteria and correcting an imbalance.

Antibiotic-associated diarrhea
Antibiotics are medications used to treat an array of illnesses caused by bacteria. Diarrhea is a common side effect of antibiotics because they disrupt the gut microbiota. Taking probiotics may help prevent diarrhea associated with antibiotic use by repopulating beneficial bacteria in the gut.
A review of 17 studies in 3,631 people demonstrated that  antibiotic-associated diarrhea  was significantly more prevalent in those who were not supplementing with probiotics.
In fact, nearly  18%  of people in the control groups had antibiotic-associated diarrhea, while only 8% of people in groups treated with probiotics were affected.
The review concluded that probiotics — particularly  Lactobacillus rhamnosus  GG and  Saccharomyces boulardii  species — may reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea by up to 51%.
In addition, antibiotic-associated diarrhea and diseases that cause diarrhea are prevalent in infants and children.
For example,  Necrotizing enterocolitis  (NEC)  may be associated with  antibiotic treatment. This disease of the intestines occurs almost exclusively in infants and is characterized by intestinal inflammation that leads to an overgrowth of bacteria, which severely damages cells of the intestines and colon. it has a death rate as high as  50% .
Studies  have shown  that probiotics may help reduce the mortality or severity of this illness in the short term, though less so in the long run. More research is necessary to verify this.

Persistent or chronic diarrhea
Chronic diarrhea  involves at least three bowel movements daily and lasts for at least  four weeks  or longer. It may be caused by certain medications, foods, or diseases like diabetes. This also includes what’s known as functional diarrhea, which doesn’t have an identifiable cause.
Probiotics, specifically the strain Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM1143,  have been shown  to improve the symptoms and overall health of chronic diarrhea patients.
In another  research,  scientists found that supplementing with a probiotic formula for a month helped reduce gastrointestinal symptoms such as functional diarrhea.

Infectious diarrhea
This type of diarrhea is caused by microorganisms like viruses, bacteria, or parasites. It includes what’s known as  traveler’s diarrhea . Examples of microorganisms that can cause diarrhea include rotavirus, E.coli, and salmonella.
It can also include  acute watery diarrhea , which can be  caused  by diseases like cholera, or acute bloody diarrhea, which is caused by  dysentery.
Infectious diarrhea is  more common  in economically disadvantaged countries and can lead to death if not treated. Treatment includes preventing dehydration, reducing the time that a person is infectious, and shortening the duration of diarrhea.
The research on probiotics and infectious diarrhea is mixed. For instance, a  review of 11 studies found that preventive  treatment with probiotic supplements significantly reduced the occurrence of traveler’s diarrhea/
Another 2019 review of 12 studies showed that only treatment with the probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii resulted in significant reductions of up to  21%  in traveler’s diarrhea.
However, other  research  shows that probiotics are unlikely  to  help reduce  the symptoms or the risk of infectious diarrhea.

What is the best probiotic to stop diarrhea?
There are hundreds of types of probiotics, but research shows that supplementing with a select few is  most beneficial  when combating diarrhea.
According to the latest scientific findings, strains that may help with treating diarrhea include:
Lactobacillus rhamnosus  GG (LGG)
Saccharomyces boulardii
Bifidobacterium lactis
Lactobacillus casei
Note that probiotics  are measured  in Colony Forming Units (CFU), which indicate the number of beneficial bacteria concentrated in each dose. Most probiotic supplements contain between 1 and 10 billion CFU per dose.
While choosing a probiotic supplement with a high CFU is essential, the strains included in the supplement and product quality are equally important.
Given that the quality and CFU of probiotic supplements can vary widely, it’s a good idea to work with a qualified healthcare professional to choose the most effective probiotic and dosage.

Are there any side effects related to probiotic use?
While probiotics are generally considered safe for both children and adults and serious side effects are rare in healthy people, some potential adverse effects may occur in certain populations.
People who are vulnerable to infections, including individuals recovering from surgery, critically ill infants, and those who have indwelling catheters or are chronically ill, are  more at risk  of experiencing adverse reactions after taking probiotics.
For example, probiotics may cause serious systemic infections, diarrhea, excessive immune system stimulation, abdominal cramping, and nausea in immunocompromised individuals.
Less serious  probiotic side effects  can occasionally occur in healthy people,  including  bloating, gas, fever, and stomach pain.
While probiotics are generally considered safe for most people, it’s always a good idea to consult your healthcare professional before adding any supplement to you or your child’s diet.

The bottom line
According to the latest research, certain  types of probiotics  may help treat and prevent different types of diarrhea, including antibiotic-associated, infectious, and traveler’s diarrhea.
Although hundreds of strains of probiotics are available in supplement form, only a few have been proven to treat diarrhea, including  Lactobacillus rhamnosus  GG , Saccharomyces boulardii, Bifidobacterium lactis,  and  Lactobacillus casei .
If you’re interested in using probiotics to treat or prevent diarrhea, consult your healthcare professional for advice.
You can purchase probiotic supplements locally or  online . Be sure to search for the strains your healthcare professional recommended.
