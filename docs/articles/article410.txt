Title: What are greens powder (super greens) and are they actually good for you?

Greens powders are supplements from greens, vegetables, seaweed, probiotics, digestive enzymes and more. They may boost immunity and reduce chronic disease risk, but research continues on the long-term effects these could have.
It’s no secret that most people don’t eat enough vegetables.
Greens powders are dietary supplements designed to help you reach your daily recommended vegetable intake.
Product labels claim that greens powders can support your body’s immunity, energy levels, detoxification, and more — but you may wonder if science supports these purported benefits.
This article tells you whether greens powders are healthy.

What are greens powders?
Greens powders are dietary supplements you can mix into water and other liquids.
They typically have a green hue and can taste a bit grassy.  Natural sugar substitutes  are often added to improve flavor.
Greens powders generally contain  25–40 or more different ingredients , which vary by brand. These commonly include:
Leafy greens:  Spinach, kale, collards, parsley
Seaweed:  Spirulina, chlorella, dulse, kelp
Other vegetables:  Broccoli, beets, carrots, tomatoes, green cabbage
Grasses:  Barley grass, wheatgrass, oat grass, alfalfa grass
High-antioxidant fruits:  Blueberries, raspberries, goji and acai berries
Nutritional extracts:  Green tea extract, grape seed extract, ginkgo biloba extract
Probiotics:   Lactobacillus (L.) rhamnosus ,  L. acidophilus ,  Bifidobacterium lactis
Plant-based digestive enzymes:  Amylase, cellulase, lipase, papain, protease
Herbs:  Holy basil,  astragalus , echinacea, milk thistle
Mushrooms:  Maitake mushroom extract, shiitake mushroom extract
Natural sugar substitutes:  Stevia leaf extract,  monk fruit extract
Extra fiber:  Rice bran, inulin, apple fiber
The produce used in these supplements is generally dried and then ground into powder. Alternatively, some ingredients may be juiced, then dehydrated, or certain components of the whole food may be extracted.
A newer trend is sprouting or  fermenting ingredients , which increases vitamin levels and helps break down compounds that can interfere with mineral absorption.
The formulations are often vegan, non-genetically modified, and organic, but check the product label for these details.

What are the ingredients in greens powders?
Because the ingredients of greens powders vary by brand, the nutritional value often differs between products.
For example,  one scoop  (10.5 grams (g) or 2 tablespoons (tbsp)) of wheat grass green superfood pure powder contains:
Calories:  35
Fat:  0 g
Total carbs:  6 g
Dietary fiber:  4 g
Sugars:  1 g
Protein:  2 g
Sodium:  1% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI)
Calcium:  4% of the RDI
Iron:  15% of the RDI
The powders are generally low calorie, but mixing them with something other than water may add calories.
Greens powders don’t always list the content of all  vitamins  and minerals. They generally aren’t as complete as a standard multivitamin and mineral supplement.
In some cases, greens powders are formulated as  meal replacements , which makes the product more nutritionally complete and higher in calories.
Though not quantified on the label, greens powders are  generally high  in polyphenols and other plant compounds that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions.

What are the benefits of greens powder or super greens?
The nutrients and plant compounds in greens powders may support overall wellness when used in combination with a  healthy diet  and lifestyle.
For example, greens powders are typically high in  vitamins A  and  C , which help support immune function.
Additionally,  probiotics  added to greens powders may support immune function and  digestive health . However, the value of added plant-based digestive enzymes is  uncertain .
Greens powders have been tested in a few small studies, but results can vary by brand and supplement formulation.
Additionally, product manufacturers typically fund these studies, which increases the risk of bias. Therefore, it’s best to keep a healthy degree of skepticism.

The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions of plant compounds in greens powder may help reduce your risk of chronic diseases.
Preventing damage to blood proteins like enzymes is important, as they  perform functions  that help protect you from chronic diseases.
A  2019 study  showed that incorporating traditional and nontraditional green leafy vegetables (GLVs) can improve blood pressure and lipid metabolism in animals at risk for hypertension.
It may also prevent diseases like atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, and inflammation. These findings support the importance of dietary fibers, antioxidants, bioactive compounds, and fatty acids for overall health. That said, more human studies are needed to confirm these possible benefits.
Some greens powders claim to  boost your energy . Yet, they’re generally low in calories and, therefore, don’t necessarily supply much energy.
However, some of these powders contain compounds that may help you feel more alert and energetic, including  green tea extract , which contains caffeine and plant compounds that support the burning of calories.
A  2021 meta-analysis of 15 studies  involving 499 participants delved into the potential effects of substances in green tea known as catechins on metabolic rate. The results showed promise for supplements with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) doses ranging from 100 to 800 milligrams (mg), but there were conflicting findings for rest metabolic rate (RMR) and energy expenditure (EE).
Still, this is only one study that needs to be replicated. It’s also uncertain whether a greens powder without green tea extract would provide the same benefits.
Some greens powders claim to help with detoxification and make your body more  alkaline  — meaning higher on the pH scale of 0 to 14.
However, consuming greens powder won’t affect your blood pH, which your body tightly controls within a narrow range of  7.35 to 7.45 .
On the other hand, your urine pH fluctuates within a broader range of  4.5–8.0 . Eating greens and other vegetables  can slightly elevate  urine pH, making it more alkaline.
Eating greens powders may still support detoxification in other ways. For example, greens powders are rich in antioxidants, which  may help  combat these free radicals.

Is consuming greens powder the same as eating vegetables?
Eating a wide variety of whole  vegetables  and other produce as part of a well-rounded diet is the best way to achieve nutritional balance and avoid excesses of any nutrient.
In their whole form, vegetables  give you  the satisfaction of chewing and are high in water. Both of these aspects promote fullness and may help prevent overeating. In this regard, greens powders are less satisfying.
Note that greens powders are generally high in  vitamin K.  This vitamin interacts with certain medications, including blood thinners, and may interfere with treatment.
They  can also contain  harmful contaminants, such as lead and other heavy metals.
Finally, some greens powders warn that children, pregnant or nursing people, and those taking medications shouldn’t use them. They often contain herbs and concentrated extracts that pose potential risks or interactions.
It’s best practice to speak to your doctor before taking any new supplement — greens powders are no exception.

How do you use greens powder?
For best results, follow the instructions on the canister of the greens powder you purchase.
It’s common to stir the powder into water, juice, milk, or  milk substitutes  and smoothies.
For food safety, refrigerate all rehydrated greens powders if you don’t consume them right away.
If you’d rather not drink your greens powder, you can:
Add them to scrambled  eggs  or an omelet
Sprinkle them over roasted vegetables
Mix them into homemade salad dressing
Stir them into a vegetable dip
Add them to soup
However, when you heat greens powder, you may decrease or eliminate some nutrients, including vitamin C and probiotics.
If your vegetable intake tends to drop when you travel, consider taking greens powder with you to help maintain your nutrition.
There is limited research to support their effectiveness. That said, consuming greens powders on a daily basis isn’t likely to hurt you. Where you can, though, it’s always better to choose whole vegetables and fruits.

The Bottom Line
Greens powders are supplements from greens, vegetables, seaweed, probiotics, digestive enzymes and more.
They may boost immunity and reduce chronic disease risk, but results may vary based on ingredients. Studies on these products are limited, and though nutritious, they should not replace whole foods.
You should still eat plenty of fresh  greens , other vegetables, and a variety of healthy foods.
