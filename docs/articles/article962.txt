Title: The 9 Best Ways to Lose Arm Fat

You may be able to reduce arm fat by focusing on overall weight loss and doing cardio exercises.
Trying to shed body fat may be challenging, especially if it’s concentrated in one area of your body.
You can’t target one specific body part for fat loss, which is known as spot reduction.
However, several methods that may help you lose overall body fat could also help trim arm fat. And some exercises could help improve your body composition by increasing the strength, size, and shape of your arm muscles.
Here are nine ways to help decrease arm fat and promote overall weight loss.

1. Focus on overall weight loss
Spot reduction  is a technique for burning fat in a specific part of the body, such as the arms. Although it’s advertised in the fitness industry, most studies have found it to be ineffective.
Limited research has examined the effects of spot reduction on the arms specifically, but some older studies exist.
For instance, a  2007 study  of 104 people showed that completing a 12-week resistance training program using only the nondominant arm increased overall fat loss but had little impact on the specific area being exercised.
Similarly, a small  2013 study  over 12 weeks found that resistance training focusing on one leg effectively decreased overall body fat but did not reduce body fat in the leg being trained.
Therefore, it’s best to focus on overall weight loss and using exercises to build muscle.

2. Start lifting weights
Resistance training  involves working against a force to build muscle mass and increase strength.  Lifting weights  is a common example.
Weightlifting may not cause fat loss in your arms specifically.
However, a  2021 review  of 58 studies found that resistance training could help reduce body fat mass,  body fat percentage , and  visceral fat . This could help your arms look slimmer and more toned.
Some upper-body weightlifting exercises that could help you build muscle include:
biceps curls
triceps extensions
overhead presses
upright rows
bench press

3. Increase your fiber intake
Adding a few additional servings of  fiber  to your diet can jumpstart weight loss and help you lose excess body fat.
According to a  2022 review , fiber could help promote weight loss by:
increasing the amount of time it takes to empty your stomach
promoting feelings of fullness for longer
reducing hunger
Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes are some examples of nutritious,  high fiber foods  that can be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet.

4. Add protein to your diet
Increasing your  protein intake  is another way to  help curb cravings and keep your appetite under control.
Some  research  suggests that eating a high protein diet could help burn body fat and preserve muscle mass, which could help change body composition.
A high protein diet could also help promote weight loss by:
increasing feelings of fullness
decreasing levels of  ghrelin , the hormone that stimulates hunger
preventing weight gain after weight loss
Meat, poultry, seafood, legumes,  eggs , and dairy products are all  high protein foods  that may help you lose arm fat fast.

5. Do more cardio
Cardio  is a type of exercise that focuses on elevating your heart rate to burn calories. When trying to lose fat, including cardio in your exercise routine is essential.
A  2022 study  in 160 adults with obesity found that a combination of cardio, resistance training, and a well-balanced diet was more effective at burning visceral and subcutaneous fat than resistance training or dieting alone.
The authors of a  2023 review  suggest that cardio alone may also help preserve muscle during fat loss, but it’s best to combine it with resistance training for best results.
The  Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans  recommends doing at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate intensity exercise weekly or 75 to 150 minutes of high intensity aerobic exercise.
This may include activities like:
jogging
biking
rowing
swimming
jumping rope
walking
dancing

6. Cut down on refined carbs
Refined carbs are  carbohydrates  that have undergone processing, resulting in a final product that is lower in several key vitamins and minerals.
Typically,  refined carbs  are high in calories. They may  also cause  spikes in blood glucose and insulin levels, which are associated with increased hunger and fat gain.
On the other hand, whole grains are higher in fiber, which could help you manage your weight. A  2023 study  in 69,246 people found that consuming whole grains was associated with less weight gain after 4 years than refined carbs.
Pasta, white bread, breakfast cereals, and other prepackaged ingredients are examples of refined carbs that often lack nutrients.
Instead, select  whole grain foods  like quinoa, buckwheat, barley, oats, and sorghum.

7. Set a sleep schedule
Getting enough sleep each night is another key factor in losing arm fat.
Several  studies  have found that lower sleep quality, duration, and onset are associated with increased body weight and total fat mass.
Sleep also plays a role in regulating appetite hormones and may also  enhance weight loss .
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommends getting  7 to 9 hours  of quality sleep each night.
Some tips to help you sleep better include:
setting a regular  sleep schedule  by going to bed at the same time throughout the week
avoiding distractions before bed
minimizing exposure to stimulants like  nicotine and caffeine

8. Stay hydrated
Drinking  plenty of water  each day is touted as an effective weight loss remedy because it may help promote feelings of fullness and decrease the total number of calories you consume.
However, the research is mixed.
A  2019 review  found that increasing daily water intake, drinking water before meals, and replacing sugary beverages with water helped decrease body weight by an average of 5.15% after 12 weeks or more. The most effective water-based weight loss remedy was replacing sugary beverages with water.
A  2024 review  found that drinking more water had no effect on body fat, but replacing sugary beverages with water had an overall effect on weight loss.
As such, it’s important to select water or other unsweetened beverages instead of  sugar-sweetened drinks  like soda or juice.

9. Do bodyweight exercises
If you don’t have access to a gym or are running short on time, doing bodyweight exercises could help enhance muscle tone in your arms and keep them looking slim.
Bodyweight exercises involve using your body as a form of resistance to build up muscle mass and strength.
A  2018 study  in 88 people ages 70 years and older found that bodyweight exercises helped improve strength, mobility, and body fat distribution.
Exercises like triceps dips, planks, and pushups may help build muscle strength and tone your arms.
