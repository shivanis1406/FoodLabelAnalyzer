Title: 12 Simple Ways to Break Through a Weight Loss Plateau

While weight tends to come off fairly rapidly at first, at some point, it can seem as though your weight won’t budge. However, several strategies may help you begin to lose weight again.
Achieving your goal weight can be tough. The inability to lose more weight after initially successful  quick weight loss  is known as a weight loss plateau or stall, which can be frustrating and discouraging.
Here are 12 tips to break a weight loss plateau.

1. Cut back on carbs
Whether carb restriction leads to a “metabolic advantage” that causes your body to burn more calories is a question that  continues to be debated  among nutrition and obesity experts.
That said, there is  some evidence  that eating a  low carb diet  may help reduce hunger. This may lead you to subconsciously eat less, making it easier to begin losing weight again without hunger or discomfort.

2. Increase exercise frequency or intensity
Your metabolic rate  slows  as you lose weight. As weight declines, the progressive reduction in metabolic rate can make continued weight loss difficult.
However,  exercise  has been shown to help counteract this effect.
Research  suggests that when it comes to losing weight, fat, and belly fat, aerobic training is more effective than resistance training. That said, resistance training also has a lot of  health benefits , so a combination of the two might be best for overall health.
If you’re already exercising, working out an extra 1–2 days per week or increasing the intensity of your workouts may help  boost your metabolic rate .
In addition, your metabolic rate increases in response to fidgeting, changing posture, and similar types of physical activity.
These types of activity are known as  non-exercise activity thermogenesis , or NEAT. NEAT can have a  major effect  on your metabolic rate, although the amount varies significantly from person to person.
An easy way to increase your NEAT is by standing up more often, including using a  standing desk .

3. Track everything you eat
Research  suggests  people have a tendency to underestimate the amount of food they eat.
That’s why tracking your calories and macronutrients — protein, fat, and carbs — can provide concrete information about how much you’re taking in. This will allow you to modify your diet if needed.
In addition,  research  suggests that the act of recording your food intake alone may improve your weight loss efforts.
Here’s a review of several user-friendly  apps and websites  to track your nutrient intake.

4. Don’t skimp on protein
If your weight loss has stalled, increasing your  protein intake  may help.
First, protein boosts metabolic rate more than fat or carbs.
This has to do with the thermic effect of food (TEF) or an increase in metabolism that occurs due to the digestion of food. Protein digestion boosts calorie burning by  20–30% , which is more than twice as much as fat or carbs.
Second, protein  stimulates  the production of hormones that help reduce appetite and make you feel full and satisfied.

5. Manage stress
Stress can often put the brakes on weight loss.
In addition to promoting comfort eating and triggering food cravings, it also increases your body’s production of cortisol.
Cortisol is known as the “stress hormone.” While it  helps  your body respond to stress, it can also increase  belly fat  storage.
Producing too much cortisol can make weight loss difficult, but  research  has shown that learning to manage stress can help promote weight loss.

6. Try intermittent fasting
Intermittent fasting  has become very popular recently. It involves going for long periods of time without eating, typically between 16–48 hours.
The practice has been credited with promoting the loss of body fat and weight, though additional  research  may be needed to verify this.
That said, here you can learn about  six different methods of intermittent fasting .

7. Avoid alcohol
Alcohol  may be  sabotaging  your weight loss efforts.
Although one alcoholic drink (4 ounces (oz) of wine, 1.5 oz of hard liquor, or 12 oz of beer) contains only around 100 calories, it provides no nutritional value. In addition, you may have more than one drink at a sitting.
Another problem is that alcohol loosens inhibitions, which may lead you to overeat or make poor food choices.  One study of 283 adults  who completed a behavioral weight loss program found that reducing alcohol intake led to a reduction in overeating and greater weight loss among those with high levels of impulsivity.
What’s more,  research  has shown that alcohol can suppress fat burning and may lead to belly fat accumulation.
If your weight loss has stalled, it may be best to avoid alcohol or only consume it occasionally in small amounts.

8. Eat more fiber
Including more  fiber  in your diet may help you break through a weight loss plateau. This is especially true for soluble  fiber , the type that dissolves in water or liquid.
To begin with, soluble fiber  slows  the movement of food through your digestive tract, which can help you feel full and satisfied.
Another way that fiber may aid weight loss is by  decreasing  the number of calories you absorb from other foods.

9. Drink water, coffee, or tea
While sugary beverages lead to weight gain, some beverages may help reverse a weight loss stall.
Research  has found that plain  water  can boost metabolism, which may translate into weight loss over time, especially in those who consume water before meals, which may help reduce food intake.
Coffee and tea  may also help  your weight loss efforts.  Green tea , in particular,  contains  an antioxidant known as EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate) that may promote weight loss.
Moreover,  research  suggests that consuming caffeinated beverages can significantly enhance the metabolism-boosting and fat-burning effects of exercise.

10. Get plenty of sleep
Sleep is extremely important for good mental, emotional, and physical health.
It’s also becoming clear that not getting enough sleep  can lead to weight gain  by lowering your metabolic rate and altering hormone levels to drive appetite and fat storage.
To support weight loss and overall health, aim for 7–8 hours of sleep per night.

11. Eat vegetables at every meal
Vegetables are the ideal food for weight loss.
Most vegetables are low in calories and carbs, high in fiber, and loaded with beneficial nutrients.
In fact,  research  has found that diets that include lots of vegetables tend to produce the greatest weight loss.
Here is a list of  healthy, low carb vegetables  to include at mealtimes.

12. Don’t rely on the scale alone
Scale reading may not always accurately reflect your progress, such as changes in your body composition.
Rather than weight loss, your goal is actually fat loss. If you’re working out regularly, you may be building muscle, which is denser than fat and takes up less room in your body.
So if the scale weight isn’t moving, you could be building muscle and losing fat, yet maintaining a stable weight.
In addition, you may retain water for a number of reasons, including your dietary choices. However, the most common reason involves  changes in hormone levels  that affect fluid balance, particularly in females assigned at birth (FAAB).
Here are several strategies you can take to help  lose water weight .
