Title: What Are the Benefits and Side Effects of Motherwort?

Also called lion’s tail, motherwort has been used in ancient herbal medicine for anxiety, heart health, and more. However, there’s limited evidence to support these potential benefits.
The ancient Greeks used motherwort (Leonurus cardiaca) to reduce anxiety during childbirth. The prickly bush is native to Asia and Southeastern Europe, and it’s  primarily used  as a tea or tincture for its potential medicinal properties.
While some forms of herbal medicine claim that it has a range of health benefits, there has not been a significant amount of scientific evidence to back it up. There are also potential side effects to be aware of.

Potential benefits of motherwort
Motherwort has been used for thousands of years for heart disease, anxiety, and irregular menstruation.
Though many of its traditional uses have not been scientifically studied, some preliminary research suggests the herb may have some potential health benefits.
Motherwort  contains  numerous plant-based compounds with antioxidant properties, including flavonoids, sterols, triterpenes, and tannins.  Antioxidants  are compounds that protect your cells from damage caused by potentially harmful molecules known as free radicals.
While  research from 2019  suggests that motherwort’s antioxidant properties may be beneficial, more evidence is needed to confirm how effective it is and how it should be used.
One traditional use of motherwort is to help reduce rapid or irregular heart rate caused by  stress or anxiety .
A  2021 study  found that motherwort extract containing certain amino acids helped to reduce anxiety in animals.
In  older test-tube and animal studies , motherwort extract showed antiarrhythmic effects, suggesting it could help lower elevated heart rate. However, these effects have not been observed in humans.
Despite limited research, some European countries  have approved  the use of motherwort to support heart health and help treat hyperthyroidism, stress, and anxiety.
While research is limited, motherwort may offer other benefits, including:
Reducing postpartum blood loss:  Early  research from 2019  suggests that treatment with motherwort and oxytocin may reduce the risk of postpartum blood loss compared with oxytocin alone.
Relieving anxiety and depression:  While limited in scope,  2017 research in rats  found a reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression after taking motherwort or leonurine.

Possible side effects
Current research on motherwort’s effects on humans is limited. As a result, the herb’s safety and potential side effects are not fully understood.
Based on  2019 findings , the potential side effects of consuming excess motherwort include:
diarrhea
uterine bleeding
stomach pain
Because motherwort has the potential to affect heart rate and rhythm, you should avoid it if you’re taking heart medication. If you do want to try it, it’s a good idea to speak with a doctor first.
The herb  has been shown  to interact with the blood thinner  warfarin . Avoid taking motherwort if you’re on a blood thinner unless your doctor recommends it.
Due to a lack of research and its potential to stimulate uterine contractions, people who are pregnant or nursing are  also advised  to avoid motherwort.

Suggested dosage
As research in humans is limited, there’s currently no set recommended dosage for motherwort.
The  European Medicines Agency (EMA)  recommends consuming less than 3 grams of powdered extract per day to avoid potential side effects.
Motherwort can be purchased as loose-leaf tea or in tincture and capsule forms.
When consumed as a tea, motherwort is often combined with  honey ,  ginger , lemon, sugar, or other strong flavors to help mask its bitterness.

The bottom line
Motherwort is an herb that has been used for thousands of years by those looking to reap its potential health benefits, particularly those related to heart health and anxiety.
However, research on its effectiveness and safety in humans is lacking. More studies are needed before it can be recommended for health purposes.
If you want to try motherwort, it’s a good idea to speak with a healthcare professional first.
