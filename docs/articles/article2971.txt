The paleo diet can be an effective option to manage weight and support overall health. But because it avoids grains, dairy, and legumes, it can be challenging to come up with flavorful, nutritionally balanced, and unique paleo meals. A paleo meal delivery service may help.
Fortunately, many meal delivery services offer paleo menus, including fully prepared fresh or frozen meals and meal kits with ingredients and recipes to make on your own. Some of these services offer paleo meals alongside other menus to accommodate different eating styles in your household.
Here we review the services that we’ve found offer consistently delicious, healthy food, and a good user experience to make paleo meal planning a lot easier.

Not only does Trifecta provide fully prepared, high protein meals featuring organic ingredients, but it’s also one of the few services that offers an entire paleo-friendly menu. That’s a big reason why it made our list as the best overall paleo meal delivery service.
All meals are fully prepared and made without processed or refined ingredients.  You’ll just need to reheat, then enjoy.
Healthline writer  Rachael Ajmera , MS, RD, said, “I heated most meals like a stir-fry and mixed in other ingredients, like vegetables, chickpeas, or seasonings. For me, the meals were filling enough for a main course.”
Trifecta Nutrition uses organic ingredients, sustainably sourced seafood, and grass-fed meat.
Each week, you can choose your own meals or opt for a curated menu and select one ingredient to exclude, such as beef, pork, or dairy.
According to Ajmera, “Many of the meals were tasty and maintained their texture well. However, a lot of the meals featured spinach, which becomes somewhat slimy and unpalatable after reheating. A few also needed extra spices and seasoning.”
Additionally, most of Trifecta’s packaging materials are recyclable. They are not only curbside recyclable but also biodegradable (including the insulation material that lines the delivery boxes).
Sample menu items:
Curried Kale with Chicken Tenders
Mango Curried Yams with Salmon
Cilantro Almond Veggies with Beef

Green Chef provides organic meal kits that fit a variety of eating patterns and offers a wide variety of paleo-friendly entrées, making it one of the best paleo meal kits on the market.
“I found that all of the recipes were flavorful and bursting with vegetables,” said Kelli McGrane, Healthline nutrition and fitness market editor.
You can prepare most meals in 30 minutes or less. Orders include pre-portioned ingredients and a simple recipe card with step-by-step instructions. But McGrane noted, “I did find some of the proportions of ingredients to be a bit off (for example, too many chickpeas relative to the amount of couscous in the apricot chickpea couscous bowls).”
Green Chef uses fully recyclable packaging materials and is the only meal kit company that offsets 100% of direct carbon emissions and plastic packaging in each box.
Sample menu items:
Pork Chops with Glazed Carrots
Turmeric-Maple Chicken Strips
Sesame-Ginger Shrimp Bowls

Even though Sunbasket is mainly known for its extensive menu and organic, high quality ingredients, we also appreciate the wide selection of paleo-friendly meals that the service offers each week.
In fact, Sunbasket’s meal kits offer a variety of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options, with around 4-7 paleo dishes per week, earning it our pick as the best organic paleo meal delivery service on the market.
Healthline editor  Kelli  McGr ane , MS, RD, said that “of all of the meal kits I’ve tried, Sunbasket’s ingredients tasted the freshest, especially the seafood and meats. I found most of the dishes to be bursting with flavor and appreciated the wide variety of ingredients used, especially vegetables.”
If you prefer, you can also opt for Sunbasket’s prepared meals, which are single-serving.
Sunbasket says it uses mostly organic produce and source meat, fish, and poultry from suppliers that adhere to strict animal welfare standards. It also uses packaging that’s mostly recyclable, reusable, or compostable.
Sample menu items:
Braised Chicken With Mushrooms, Artichokes, and Almond-Olive Relish

Snap Kitchen aims to provide balanced meals that are high quality and healthy, including over 15 paleo entrees, proteins, sides, and desserts each week.
“For the price, I would expect to get more food in each meal,” said Healthline writer Lauren Manaker, MS, RDN. “But, they were easy to enjoy and I appreciate how quickly they are able to be consumed. There are many options for people following low carb or Paleo diets.
“For people who want more produce and plant-based meals, this might not be the best fit.”
All meals are fully prepared and easily heated, and you can order either 6 or 12 per week. Plus, Snap Kitchen uses packaging that’s fully recyclable.
