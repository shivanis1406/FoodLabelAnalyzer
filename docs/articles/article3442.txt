Title: 18 Foods That Pack More Potassium Than a Banana

Bananas may be known as potassium-rich foods, but you can also get potassium from avocados, sweet potatoes, spinach, coconut water, and other delicious food and drinks.
Potassium is a vital mineral and electrolyte that your body needs to maintain normal blood pressure, transport nutrients into your cells, and support healthy nerve and muscle function ( 1 ).
It’s considered an essential nutrient because your body can’t produce it. Therefore, you must get potassium from foods to meet your recommended daily needs, also known as the Daily Value (DV) ( 2 ).
However, most people don’t get enough potassium through their diets. It’s estimated that less than 0.015% of American adults meet their daily potassium needs ( 3 ).
Since a medium banana contains around 9% of the DV for this mineral, most people consider it the go-to food to increase their potassium intake. However, bananas are not the only good source of potassium ( 4 ).

A list of high-potassium foods
Here are 18 foods that pack more potassium than a banana.
Avocados  are packed with  healthy fats , vitamin K, and folate.
Half an avocado without the skin and seed (68 grams) contains 345 mg of potassium, or 7% of the DV. If you eat a whole avocado, you’ll get almost 15% of the DV at once ( 5 ).
What’s more, avocados may benefit people with  high blood pressure , who often need to increase their potassium and  reduce their sodium intake . Like most other fruits, avocados are low in sodium, with half an avocado providing just 0.2% of the DV ( 1 ,  3 ,  5 ).
Avocados are packed with nutrients, and one avocado provides roughly 15% of your daily potassium needs. They’re also rich in vitamin K and folate.
Sweet potatoes  are often used as an alternative to white potatoes.
They’re an exceptionally nutritious way to support your potassium intake. A 1-cup (328-gram) serving of mashed sweet potato boasts 16% of the DV ( 6 ).
What’s more,  sweet potatoes  are low in fat, offer a small amount of protein, and are a good source of  complex carbs  and  fiber .
They’re also an excellent source of  vitamin A , which is critical for vision. The same serving of sweet potatoes provides more than 200% of the DV of vitamin A ( 1 ,  6 ,  7 ).
For a balanced and filling meal, you can pair these delicious root vegetables with a protein source such as beans or meat, some dark greens or colorful vegetables, and a little fat.
Sweet potatoes boast 16% of the DV for potassium in just 1 mashed cup (328 grams), plus some protein, fiber, and vitamin A.
Spinach  is one of the most  nutrient-dense  vegetables.
Just 1 cup (190 grams) of frozen spinach packs 12% of the DV for potassium. Similarly, about 3 cups (90 grams) of raw spinach contain roughly 11% of the DV ( 8 ,  9 ).
It’s also loaded with other nutrients. The same serving of frozen spinach contains 127% of the DV for vitamin A, 857% for  vitamin K , 58%  for folate , and 37% for  magnesium  ( 1 ,  8 ).
Spinach provides about 12% of the DV for potassium per 1 cup (190 grams) frozen or 3 cups (90 grams) fresh. This vegetable also offers folate, magnesium, and vitamins A and K.
Watermelon is a large, delicious fruit with  high water content .
Just 2 wedges (about 1/8 of a melon, or 572 grams) provides just under 14% of the DV for potassium ( 1 ,  10 ).
The same serving also contains 44 grams of carbs, 3.5 grams of protein, 0.8 grams of fat, and 2.2 grams of fiber. What’s more, this lush,  red melon  is a great source of magnesium and vitamins A and C ( 10 ).
Watermelon is a tasty summertime fruit that provides about 14% of the DV for potassium in just 2 wedges. It also offers several other vitamins and minerals.
Coconut water  is a particularly  hydrating  drink.
It’s an excellent natural alternative to sports drinks, as it contains  key electrolytes  that help draw water into your cells. Its natural sugars also provide energy during exercise and help replenish lost glycogen stores afterward ( 11 ).
Just 1 cup (240 mL) of coconut water contains 13% of the DV for potassium. Plus, it’s a good source of magnesium, sodium, and  manganese  ( 1 ,  12 ).
Coconut water is very refreshing when served chilled with ice after a sweaty workout. Just make sure to avoid varieties with added sugar.
Coconut water is not only a great hydrating drink but also an excellent source of potassium, containing 13% of the DV in just 1 cup (240 mL). It’s also a good source of magnesium, sodium, and manganese.
Beans  are a nutritious source of complex carbs and plant-based protein.
Just 1 cup (179 grams) of white beans has twice as much potassium as a banana, clocking in at a whopping 21% of the DV. The same serving of  black beans  provides 13% of the DV ( 1 ,  13 ,  14 ).
While black beans contain  phytates  — an  antinutrient  that may reduce your body’s mineral absorption — you can soak dried beans overnight to help  reduce their phytate content , as this compound will leach into the water ( 15 ).
Both white and black beans are incredibly versatile and easy to add to  salads , burritos, and stews.
Beans are a terrific source of potassium. While white beans pack more potassium than black beans, both are delicious ways to add more of this mineral to your diet.
Aside from beans,  the legume family  includes  lentils ,  chickpeas ,  soybeans , and  peanuts  — all of which are high in potassium.
For instance, a 1-cup (198-gram) serving of lentils packs 15% of the DV for the mineral, while the same serving of chickpeas, soybeans, and peanuts provide 10%, 19%, and 23% of the DV, respectively ( 16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  19 ).
Certain legumes, such as lentils and chickpeas, contain phytates. Therefore, remember to soak them overnight to reduce their phytate content. You can also try  sprouting them  ( 15 ).
Legumes such as lentils, chickpeas, soybeans, and peanuts are rich in potassium. Soaking or sprouting them before eating them may improve mineral absorption.
Tomato paste is made from cooked tomatoes that have been peeled and seeded.
Just 3 tablespoons (50 grams) contain more than 10% of the DV. Tomato paste is also a good source of vitamin C and  lycopene , a potent antioxidant with cancer-fighting properties ( 1 ,  20 ,  21 ).
This concentrated  condiment  adds flavor to all tomato-based sauces and dishes, but watch out for products that have  added sugars , additives, or preservatives. You may want to pick the product with the fewest ingredients.
Tomato paste not only enriches the taste of your food but also provides ample amounts of potassium. Just 3 tablespoons (50 grams) pack around 10% of the DV.

Just 1 cup (205 grams) provides 12% of the DV for potassium. It’s also a great source of vitamins A and C and has smaller amounts of B vitamins,  vitamin E , and magnesium ( 1 ,  22 ).
You can easily roast, boil, steam, or chop butternut squash for dishes such as baked  veggies  or hearty soups.
Butternut squash is a great source of potassium, boasting 12% of the DV in a single cup (205 grams).
Potatoes are a starchy  root vegetable  that remains a staple food in numerous countries.
One medium boiled  potato  (167 grams) offers 12% of the DV for potassium ( 1 ,  23 ).
However, there are many varieties of potatoes, and their potassium content may depend on the soil in which they’re grown.
Potatoes are rich in potassium and are a staple in many households. One medium spud typically provides 12% of the DV for this mineral.
Dried  apricots  have a  long shelf life  and are usually pitted. Just 1/2 cup (65 grams) provides 16% of the DV for potassium ( 1 ,  24 ).
These fruits are also a  good source of fiber  and vitamins A and E ( 24 ).
Dried apricots are delicious mixed into  muesli  or as a  healthy snack  for hikes or camping trips.
Dried apricots are a great alternative to bananas for a potassium boost. Just 1/2 cup packs 16% of the DV, as well as fiber and vitamins A and E.
Swiss chard, also known as silverbeet or simply chard, is a  leafy green vegetable  with a thick stalk that ranges from red to orange to white in color.
It’s also highly nutritious. Just 1 cup (175 grams) of cooked chard offers 20% of the DV for potassium — more than double the potassium in a banana ( 1 ,  25 ).
The same serving packs 476% of the DV for vitamin K and 60% of the DV for vitamin A, all while being low in calories and  high in fiber  ( 25 ).
Swiss chard  makes a delicious base for salads and is easy to steam or saute with a little oil.
Swiss chard contains more than twice as much potassium per cooked cup (175 grams) as a banana — about 20% of the DV.
Just 1 cup (170 grams) of boiled  beets  gives you 11% of the DV for potassium ( 1 ,  26 ).
Plus,  this root vegetable  contains  nitrates , which have been shown to support blood vessel function and overall  heart health  when converted into  nitric oxide  in your body ( 27 ).
Beets are also an excellent source of folate — a vitamin needed for DNA synthesis and repair — with 1 boiled cup (170 grams) providing 34% of the DV ( 26 ,  28 ).
You can eat  beets  boiled, pickled, or raw.

Pomegranates  are an extremely healthy, many-seeded fruit that vary in color from red to purple. One whole fruit (282 grams) gives you 14% of the DV for potassium ( 29 ).
Moreover, pomegranates are packed with  folate  and vitamins C and K. They also pack more protein than most other fruits, at 4.7 grams per fruit (282 grams) ( 29 ).
Pomegranates offer 14% of the DV for potassium, as well as sizable amounts of folate, fiber, protein, and vitamins C and K.
Drinking fruit and vegetable juices is another easy way to increase your potassium intake.
Citrus juices  seem to provide the most potassium ( 3 ).
For example, 1 cup (240 mL) of 100% orange juice offers about 10% of the DV for potassium, while the same serving of  grapefruit  juice provides 9% of the DV ( 30 ,  31 ).
Juices from potassium-rich fruits such as pomegranates are also great alternatives. A 1-cup (240-mL) serving of  pomegranate juice  packs 11% of the DV ( 32 ).
Some vegetable juices are also rich in this mineral.
For instance, 1 cup (240 mL) of  carrot juice  boasts 15% of the DV, and the same serving of  tomato juice  provides 10% of the DV ( 33 ,  34 ).
Fruit and veggie juices such as orange, grapefruit, pomegranate, carrot, and tomato juice all provide 9% or more of the DV for potassium in 1 cup (240 mL).
Certain lean and fatty fish offer potassium.
For example, just half a fillet (154 grams) of cooked cod provides 12% of the DV, and a whole fillet (150 grams) of haddock offers 11% ( 35 ,  36 ).
Similarly, half a fillet (154 grams) of cooked  salmon  has a whopping 21% of the DV, and the same serving of  tuna  boasts 17% of the DV ( 37 ,  38 ).
In addition, fatty fish such as salmon and tuna are rich in heart-healthy  omega-3 fatty acids , which may further reduce your risk of heart disease ( 39 ).
Various lean and fatty fish species are excellent potassium sources. In addition, omega-3s in fish such as salmon and tuna may help reduce heart disease risk.
Yams  are starchy tubers popular in South America, Western Africa, and the Caribbean. They’re very similar to yucca or  cassava , but their flesh varies in color from yellowish-white to purple or pink.
Yams  also happen to be rich in potassium, with 1 cooked, cubed cup (136 grams) providing 19% of the DV ( 40 ).
A 1-cup serving (136 grams) of cooked yam provides more than twice as much potassium as a medium banana.
Salt substitutes  were designed to help reduce sodium intake, because excess salt consumption may lead to high blood pressure ( 3 ,  41 ).
These substitutes replace sodium with another element or mix of elements — typically potassium — to reduce heart disease without reducing perceived  salt intake  or diminishing the taste ( 41 ).
Unlike regular salt, which is 100% sodium chloride, salt substitutes may be composed of 65% sodium chloride, 25% potassium chloride, and 10% magnesium  sulfate . Others may offer 100%  potassium chloride , which packs 11% of the DV in just 1 gram ( 41 ,  42 ).
However, keep in mind that people with kidney or  liver disease  may need to avoid salt substitutes that are high in potassium ( 43 ).
Salt substitutes consisting of 100% potassium chloride provide 11% of the DV for the mineral in a single gram.

How much potassium do you need?
Like other vitamins and minerals, potassium is a  micronutrient , meaning that you need to consume it only in small amounts — think milligrams (mg).
As previously mentioned, vitamin and mineral needs are measured according to their Daily Values (DV), the recommended amounts to consume per day ( 2 ).
The  DV for potassium  for healthy individuals is 4,700 mg. You can consume this amount by following a wholesome, varied diet ( 2 ).
Many Western diets are low in potassium and high in sodium — two factors that can increase your risk of heart disease. However, eating foods from the list above may help you increase your potassium intake ( 44 ).

Frequently asked questions
For most people, the recommended daily intake for potassium is 4,700 mg ( 2 ).
Foods that are good sources of potassium include dried fruit, lentils, spinach, sweet potatoes, and orange juice ( 1 ).
Adding potassium to the diet or taking supplements, if a doctor recommends, can increase your potassium levels.
Early symptoms of  low potassium  include  constipation , fatigue,  muscle weakness ,  a general feeling of being unwell . A more severe deficiency can lead to an increase in diluted urine, muscular  paralysis , and changes in heart rhythm, among other symptoms ( 1 ).
The DV for potassium for healthy individuals is 4,700 mg, which you can reach by following a balanced diet.

The bottom line
Although  bananas  are a good source of potassium, many other nutritious foods, including sweet potatoes, legumes, and beets, offer more potassium per serving. Swiss chard, yams, and white beans even have twice as much potassium per cup as a medium banana.
The key to getting enough  potassium  is to eat a range of plant foods each day. Certain fish, such as salmon, tuna, and cod, are good animal-based sources of this mineral too.
Try this today:  If you want to increase your potassium intake on a budget, focus on legumes like beans or  veggies  like potatoes, which provide plenty of potassium at a low cost.
