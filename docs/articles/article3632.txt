The company’s flagship product, DS-01 Daily Synbiotic, includes both pre- and probiotics for comprehensive gut health.
Because the supplement is pricier than some other probiotics and requires a subscription, you may be wondering whether Seed DS-01 Daily Synbiotic is worth the cost.

What is Seed DS-01 Daily Synbiotic?
Founded in 2018 by Ara Katz and Raja Dhir, Seed is a subscription-based probiotic company.
The company offers two products: DS-01 Daily Synbiotic, which is formulated for adults, and PDS-01 Pediatric Daily Supplement, which is formulated  for kids  and teens ages 3–17 years.
DS-01 Daily Synbiotic contains four unique blends of probiotics with a specific health focus.
Below is a quick look at the blends.
If you’ve shopped for a probiotic supplement before, you’ve likely seen “CFU count” listed on the bottle. CFU stands for colony forming units and is a measure of the viable and culturable probiotic cells per dose.
Seed DS-01 Daily Synbiotic stands out in that it uses  active fluorescent units (AFUs)  instead of CFUs.
Research  suggests that AFU may be a more accurate measure than CFU because it measures all viable cells, including those that may not be culturable.
AFU count:  37.0 billion
Strains:  Bifidobacterium longum SD-BB536-JP, Bifidobacterium breve SD-BR3-IT, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SD-LP1-IT, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus SD-LR6-IT, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus HRVD113-US, Bifidobacterium infantis SD-M63-JP, Bifidobacterium lactis SD-BS5-IT, Bifidobacterium lactis HRVD524-US, Lactobacillus crispatus SD-LCR01-IT, Lacticaseibacillus casei HRVD300-US, Bifidobacterium breve HRVD521-US, Bifidobacterium longum HRVD90b-US, Bifidobacterium lactis SD150-BE, Limosilactobacillus fermentum SD-LF8-IT, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus SD-GG-BE, Limosilactobacillus reuteri RD830-FR
AFU count:  3.30 billion
Strains:  Ligilactobacillus salivarius SD-LS1-IT, Bifidobacterium lactis SD-CECT8145-SP, Bifidobacterium longum SD-CECT7347-SP, Lacticaseibacillus casei SD-CECT9104-SP
AFU count:  5.25 billion
Strains:  Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SD-LPLDL-UK, Bifidobacterium lactis SD-MB2409-IT
AFU count:  8.05 billion
Strains:  Bifidobacterium adolescentis SD-BA5-IT, Limosilactobacillus reuteri SD-LRE2-IT
The product also contains Indian pomegranate, a prebiotic that Seed claims is suitable for individuals with sensitive digestive tracts and those following a  low FODMAP diet .

Ingredient quality and packaging
Seed DS-01 Daily Synbiotic is vegan-friendly, free from major allergens, and suitable for those following a low FODMAP diet due to its nonfermenting prebiotics.
The product is also shelf-stable and comes in an eco-friendly glass container.
Seed’s delivery system, known as  ViaCap , is also notable. According to the company, this capsule technology protects probiotic strains from stomach acid, ensuring that the  probiotics  reach the intestines where they can provide the most benefit.
A  2021 study  funded by Seed found ViaCap to be effective in protecting probiotics in acidic environments, though more research is needed to confirm.
Seed DS-01 Synbiotic undergoes rigorous third-party testing for pesticides, herbicides, allergens, and contaminants to ensure purity and quality. Final products are also tested to confirm potency, which helps make sure that ingredients are present in the listed amounts.

Science behind Seed Daily Synbiotic
Two  clinical trials  are currently underway to study the effectiveness of Seed DS-01 Daily Synbiotic for general gut health in adults after a course of antibiotics and for improving symptoms in adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
Because the studies are in progress, the effectiveness of Seed DS-01 Daily Synbiotic is unknown. However, the product does contain several probiotic strains that have been shown to have benefits for gut, skin, and heart health.
For example,  Lactiplantibacillus plantarum  and  Bifidobacterium lactis  may be beneficial for heart health by potentially helping lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Still,  more research  on the role of probiotic supplements in heart health is needed.
Perhaps most interesting is the product’s inclusion of probiotics intended to support the  gut-skin axis .
For example,  Bifidobacterium longum  may help even skin tone and aid in the treatment of  atopic dermatitis , while  Ligilactobacillus salivarius  may be a potentially effective treatment for atopic dermatitis.
DS-01 Daily Synbiotic also contains  Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus , which has been shown to be effective in managing  diarrhea  in people with IBS. It also includes several strains that  test tube studies  suggest may help support the gut’s protective lining, a key component of the body’s immune defense.
Finally, Seed DS-01 Daily Synbiotic also includes Indian pomegranate. Pomegranates are rich in  polyphenols , which may act similarly to prebiotics. The good bacteria in the gut can break down these polyphenols, potentially using them for energy, similar to how they use  prebiotics .
Overall, Seed DS-01 Daily Synbiotic contains several evidence-backed probiotic strains. Still, it’s important to note that some of the reported  health benefits  of these probiotics are based on test tube studies or older research.
While there’s some evidence to support the benefits of specific strains found in Seed DS-01 Daily Synbiotic, newer human studies are needed to confirm whether taking these probiotics in supplement form translates to meaningful effects on health.

How much does Seed DS-01 Daily Synbiotic cost?

Our testers’ firsthand experience with Seed DS-01 Daily Synbiotic
Several of our editors tested Seed DS-01 Daily Synbiotic.
Editor Kelle Walsh tried Seed DS-01 for just under 10 days and commented: “Upon receiving my DS-01 Daily Synbiotic 30-day sample from Seed, I was immediately impressed with the care that went into the packaging — all biodegradable — and that the supplements come in a refillable dark glass container, to protect them from light.
“I also liked that a smaller travel-sized vial (also glass) was provided, so you can take your supplements in measured amounts on a trip.” Walsh ultimately discontinued daily use due to other health issues, but felt Seed was worth considering for people who have been recommended to take a pre- and probiotic supplement by a healthcare professional.
Senior Director Rita Mauceri tried Seed DS-01 for 30 days.
The product comes with detailed instructions on how to begin taking DS-01. She commented: “Seed advises you to start with 1 capsule a day for several days, before moving to 2 capsules a day. I followed the directions and had no issues. I did notice after 4-5 days that my bloating disappeared which was great.”
She went on to say, “I typically prefer very small capsules or pills. These were a bit larger (I’d say average capsule size) but I found them very easy to take.”
Like other testers, Mauceri also appreciated the travel-size vial which was included. “I find traveling often makes my gut act up, but Seed’s travel packaging makes it easy to take these on the go, which I recently did on a trip to Italy.”

Who is Seed DS-01 for?
Seed DS-01 Daily Synbiotic is designed for healthy individuals over the age of 18 who are interested in its potential health benefits.
It may be particularly beneficial for people regularly experiencing digestive symptoms like  diarrhea  or constipation.
However, this supplement may not be suitable for certain individuals, including:
Pregnant or breastfeeding people:  While probiotics are generally considered safe for  pregnant and breastfeeding  individuals, the specific effects of the DS-01 formulation on pregnant or breastfeeding individuals have not been extensively studied, so it’s a good idea to run it by your doctor first.
Immunocompromised people:  People with  weakened immune systems , either due to medical conditions or treatments, should meet with their doctor first. Probiotics introduce live bacteria into the body, which could pose risks for individuals with a compromised immune system.
Keep in mind that probiotics are not necessary or appropriate for everyone and can lead to unwanted  side effects . Additionally, because different probiotic strains have different health effects, you’ll want to consider your reasons for taking a probiotic supplement to ensure that DS-01 is the right fit.
Before taking Seed or another probiotic supplement, it’s important to talk with a trusted healthcare professional for personalized advice.

Potential side effects
According to the company, it’s not unusual to experience mild GI side effects during the first few days of taking Seed DS-01 Daily Synbiotic. These side effects may include:
bloating
nausea
changes in stool
general GI discomfort
To help your body adjust to the supplement, Seed recommends taking just 1 capsule per day for the first 3 days and then increase to the full dose of 2 capsules on day 4.
