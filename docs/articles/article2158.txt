Title: 12 Delicious Oatmeal Alternatives

Oatmeal is a classic breakfast dish, beloved for both its flavor and its versatility.
In fact, you may already be enjoying your oatmeal, either sweet or savory, when you start to switch up your ingredients.
However, if you’re feeling stuck in a rut with your morning meal or looking for gluten-free, high protein, or keto-friendly alternatives, plenty are available.
Here are 12 tasty oatmeal alternatives you can make at home.

1–2. Gluten-free
Amaranth  is an ancient grain with a slightly sweet, nutty taste that works well in place of oatmeal.
In addition to being gluten-free, amaranth is a good source of several key nutrients, including protein, fiber, iron, and  manganese  ( 1 ).
Try making an easy breakfast porridge by combining amaranth with coconut or almond milk and simmering it for around 20 minutes, until it becomes soft and creamy. Then, top it off with your favorite fruits and add a drizzle of honey or maple syrup to sweeten your breakfast.
Naturally gluten-free and rich in vitamins and minerals such as phosphorus, magnesium, and folate, millet may be the most nutritious substitute for oatmeal ( 2 ).
To whip up a simple and scrumptious breakfast porridge with millet, combine millet with your choice of milk in a saucepan, bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 20–25 minutes, until fully cooked.
Stir in your favorite sweetener and sprinkle on some toppings such as sliced fruits, nuts, or shredded coconut. Dig in!

3–4. High protein
With its nutty taste,  quinoa  can provide you with plenty of protein and flavor in an oatmeal alternative.
In addition to its impressive protein content, quinoa is loaded with  fiber , iron, magnesium, and folate ( 3 ).

Buckwheat is a high protein  whole grain  known for its earthy taste.
Buckwheat groats boast a large amount of fiber, along with vitamins and minerals like potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium ( 4 ).
