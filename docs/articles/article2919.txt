Title: What Potassium Does for Your Body: A Detailed Review

A potassium-rich diet is linked to many powerful health benefits. It may help reduce blood pressure and water retention, help prevent osteoporosis, and protect against stroke.
People often underestimate the importance of potassium. It’s classified as an electrolyte because it’s highly reactive in water.
When dissolved in water, potassium produces positively charged ions. This special property allows it to conduct electricity, which is important for many processes throughout your body.
This article provides a detailed review of potassium, how your body uses it, and how it may benefit your health.

How your body uses potassium
Roughly  98%  of the potassium in your body is found in your cells. Of this, 80% is found in your muscle cells, while the other 20% can be found in your bones, liver, and red blood cells.
Once inside your body,  potassium functions as an electrolyte . When in water, an electrolyte dissolves into positive or negative ions that can conduct electricity. Potassium ions  carry a positive charge .
Your body uses this electricity to manage a  variety of processes , including:
maintaining fluid balance
sending nerve signals
regulating muscle contraction
The body is made of about  60% water . Roughly  40% of this water  is found inside your cells in a substance called intracellular fluid (ICF). The rest is found outside your cells in areas such as your blood and spinal fluid and between your cells. This fluid is called extracellular fluid (ECF).
Interestingly, the amount of water in the ICF and ECF is affected by their concentration of electrolytes, especially potassium and sodium.
Potassium is the main electrolyte in the ICF, and it determines the amount of water inside your cells. Conversely, sodium is the main electrolyte in the ECF, and it determines the amount of water outside your cells.
The amount of electrolytes relative to the amount of fluid is called osmolality. Under normal conditions, the osmolality is the same inside and outside your cells. Simply put, there’s an equal balance of electrolytes outside and inside your cells.
But when osmolality is unequal, water from the side with fewer electrolytes will move into the side with more electrolytes to equalize the electrolyte concentrations. This may cause cells to shrink as water moves out of them or swell up and burst as water moves into them.
That’s why it’s important to make sure you consume the right electrolytes, including potassium. Maintaining good fluid balance is important for optimal health. Inadequate fluid balance  can lead to dehydration , which in turn affects your heart and kidneys.
Eating a potassium-rich diet and staying hydrated can help you maintain good fluid balance.
Your nervous system relays messages between your brain and your body. These messages are delivered in the form of nerve impulses, which help regulate several functions,  including :
muscle contractions
heartbeat
reflexes
kidney function
Interestingly, nerve impulses are generated by sodium ions moving into cells and potassium ions moving out of cells. The movement of ions changes the voltage of the cell, which  activates a nerve impulse . A drop in potassium levels can affect your body’s ability to generate a nerve impulse.
Getting enough potassium from your diet can help you maintain healthy nerve function.
Your nervous system helps regulate muscle contractions. But changes in blood potassium levels can affect nerve signals in your nervous system, weakening muscle contractions.
Both low and high blood potassium levels can affect nerve impulses by  changing the voltage  of nerve cells.
Potassium is also important for a healthy heart, as its movement into and out of cells helps maintain a regular heartbeat. If your blood levels of potassium are too high, your heart may become dilated and flaccid. This can weaken its contractions and produce an abnormal heartbeat.
Likewise, low potassium levels in your blood can affect your heartbeat. When your heart does not beat properly, it can’t effectively pump blood to your brain, other organs, and muscles.

Health benefits of potassium
A potassium-rich diet may help:
lower blood pressure
reduce water retention
protect against stroke
prevent osteoporosis
possibly prevent the formation of kidney stones
High blood pressure affects  almost half  of adults in the United States. It’s a risk factor for  heart disease  and  stroke .
High sodium levels  can increase blood pressure , especially in people whose blood pressure is already high.
A potassium-rich diet may reduce blood pressure by  helping your body remove excess sodium .
A stroke happens when there’s a lack of blood flow to your brain. In 2022,  1 in 6 deaths  from cardiovascular disease in the United States were due to stroke.
Several studies have found that eating a potassium-rich diet may be  associated with  a lower risk of stroke.
In an  older analysis of 33 studies  that included a total of 128,644 participants, scientists found that people who ate the most potassium had a 24% lower risk of stroke than people who ate the least.
Additionally, the authors of a  2011 analysis of 11 studies  with 247,510 participants found that people who ate the most potassium had a 21% lower risk of stroke. They also found that eating a diet rich in this mineral was linked to a reduced risk of heart disease.
Osteoporosis  is a condition involving hollow and porous bones. It’s  often linked to low levels of calcium , an important mineral for  bone health .
Interestingly,  studies show  that a potassium-rich diet may help prevent osteoporosis by reducing the amount of calcium your body loses through urine.
Kidney stones  are clumps of material that may form in concentrated urine.
Calcium is a common mineral in kidney stones. Research, such as this  2015 review , suggests that potassium citrate lowers calcium levels in urine. In this way, potassium may help  fight kidney stones .
However, a small  2018 study  suggests that potassium citrate lowers urine calcium levels and raises the pH levels of urine. This increases calcium phosphate formation, canceling out protection against kidney stones. But this study had only 13 participants.
Further studies are recommended to learn how potassium may help prevent kidney stones.
Many fruits and vegetables contain potassium citrate, so it’s easy to add to your diet.
Water retention happens when excess fluid builds up in your body. Historically, potassium has been used to treat water retention.
Research from 2017  suggests that a high potassium intake can help  reduce water retention  by increasing urine production and reducing sodium levels.

How much calcium should you consume per day?
The  National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends  that people consume the following amounts of potassium (measured in milligrams [mg]) each day:

Foods that are rich sources of potassium
Potassium is found in a variety of foods and nonalcoholic beverages. Fruits and vegetables are excellent sources, as are soybeans and potatoes. Meats, chicken, fish, milk, and nuts also contain good amounts of potassium.
The NIH lists the following  potassium content for selected foods :
Apricots, dried, 1/2 cup:  755 mg
Lentils, cooked, 1 cup:  731 mg
Acorn squash, cooked, 1 cup:  644 mg
Potato, baked:  610 mg
Banana, 1 medium:  422 mg
Milk, 1%, 1 cup:  366 mg
Spinach, raw, 2 cups:  334 mg
Chicken breast, grilled, 3 ounces:  332 mg
Yogurt, nonfat, 6 ounces:  330 mg
Salmon, cooked, 3 ounces:  326 mg
Soymilk, 1 cup:  287 mg
Broccoli, cooked, 1/2 cup:  229 mg
Brown rice, cooked, 1 cup:  154 mg
Coffee, brewed, 1 cup:  116 mg
Tea, black, brewed, 1 cup:  88 mg
1 egg:  69 mg
Over-the-counter supplements are not a great way to increase your potassium intake.
In many countries, food authorities limit potassium in over-the-counter supplements to  99 mg , which is much less than you can get from just one serving of the potassium-rich foods above.
This 99-mg limit is likely because many studies have found that high doses of potassium from supplements  may damage the gut  and may even lead to death due to abnormal heart rhythm.
But if you have a diagnosed potassium deficiency, your doctor may prescribe a higher dose supplement.

The takeaway
Potassium is one of the most important minerals in your body. It helps regulate fluid balance, muscle contractions, and nerve signals.
What’s more, a high potassium diet may help reduce blood pressure and water retention, protect against stroke, and prevent osteoporosis and possibly kidney stones.
Very few people get enough potassium. To get more in your diet, you can consume more potassium-rich foods, such as lentils, potatoes, spinach, and salmon.
