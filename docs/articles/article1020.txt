Title: How Many Calories and Carbs Are in a Banana?

Bananas are extremely healthy and contain several important nutrients. A medium banana only contains 105 calories, on average. However, more than 90% of a banana is composed of carbs.
People generally know that bananas are very nutritious, but many wonder how many calories and carbs they actually contain.
This article answers those questions.

How many calories are in various sizes of bananas?
Bananas contain around 100 calories, but this can vary by the fruit size and how you consume it. Below are the  calorie contents  of standard banana sizes:
Extra small  (shorter than 6 inches, 81 grams): 72 calories
Small  (6–7 inches, 101 grams): 90 calories
Medium  (7–8 inches, 118 grams): 105 calories
Large  (8–9 inches, 136 grams): 121 calories
Extra large  (9 inches or longer, 152 grams): 135 calories
Sliced  (1 cup, 150 grams): 134 calories
Mashed  (1 cup, 225 grams): 200 calories
If you’re unsure about the size of your banana, you can estimate that an average banana contains about 100 calories.
About 93% of a banana’s calories come from carbs, 4% from protein, and 3% from fat.

How many carbs are in a banana?
Bananas are almost exclusively composed of  water  and carbs.
People who watch their  carb intake  are interested in knowing the carb content of their food.
Here is the  carb content  of standard banana sizes:
Extra small  (shorter than 6 inches, 81 grams): 19 grams
Small  (6–7 inches, 101 grams): 23 grams
Medium  (7–8 inches, 118 grams): 27 grams
Large  (8–9 inches, 136 grams): 31 grams
Extra large  (9 inches or longer, 152 grams): 35 grams
Sliced  (1 cup, 150 grams): 34 grams
Mashed  (1 cup, 225 grams): 51 grams
A banana also contains 2–4 grams of fiber, depending on its size. You can subtract 2–4 grams if you are looking for the “net” carb content (net carbs = total carbs – fiber).
Additionally, a banana’s ripeness may affect its carb content.
Generally,  green or unripe bananas  contain fewer digestible carbs than ripe bananas.

Unripe (green) bananas contain more resistant starch
The main nutrient in bananas is carbs, but the carb composition changes drastically during ripening.
Unripe bananas contain high amounts of starch, and some of it is  resistant starch .
Because the starch in a banana is converted to  sugar  during ripening, yellow bananas contain much less resistant starch than green ones.
Resistant starch is a type of indigestible carbohydrate that escapes digestion and functions like  fiber  in the body.
It reaches the colon undigested. There, it feeds friendly gut bacteria.
When the bacteria digest resistant starches, they form gases and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are important for digestive health.
About  95%  of these SCFAs are then rapidly absorbed by the cells in the colon and used by the body for energy.
So although resistant starches will not yield as many calories as regular carbs during digestion, they may be transformed into SCFAs that provide calories later.
Therefore, green and yellow bananas may provide similar amounts of calories in the end.

Bananas contain many other beneficial nutrients
Bananas contain good amounts of several vitamins and minerals.
One medium banana  contains:
Fiber:  3.1 grams
Vitamin B6:  25% of the DV
Vitamin C:  11% of the DV
Manganese:  14% of the DV
Potassium:  12% of the DV
Folate:  6% of the DV
Riboflavin (vitamin B2):  7% of the DV

FAQ
Bananas are high in both sugar and fiber, depending on their ripeness. This makes them both a healthy source of energy before exercising and a food that should be monitored if you are reducing your carb and sugar intake.
The soluble fiber and resistant starch in bananas contribute to a feeling of satiety, so eating a banana will keep you feeling satisfied for a longer time than many other high-carb foods.
With  27 grams  of carbs in one medium-sized banana, including  14 grams  of sugars and  6 grams  of starch, bananas do raise blood sugar. However, the fiber content will help moderate blood sugar spikes. If you are living with diabetes, check your blood sugar before and after eating bananas to monitor levels.

The bottom line
Bananas generally contain 72–135 calories and 19-35 grams of carbs, depending on their size. An average-sized banana contains about 100 calories and 25 grams of carbs.
Bananas are tasty and nutritious. They make an excellent, healthy, and low calorie snack.
