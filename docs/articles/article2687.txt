Resistance   magnetic resistance
Display type   none
This high quality  indoor cycling  bike is a great choice for those looking to squeeze in a quick cycling workout straight from their living room. The bike’s solid build features a heavy duty steel frame and 44-pound (lb) — 20-kilogram (kg) — flywheel.
It features magnetic resistance, which is a mechanism that uses magnets to create tension, making it easy to modify the intensity based on your fitness level. An indoor cycling bike like this is different from an exercise bike in that it allows for more strenuous workouts, although you can easily use it for moderate workouts or warmups.
The bike also has an adjustable seat and handlebars, allowing you to further customize your bike for a comfortable ride.
This bike is easy to assemble and simple to use. Though it doesn’t have a display screen, it has a device holder so you can stream your favorite workouts using your smartphone or tablet. It can be a great choice if you’re looking for the best exercise bike without a subscription.

Resistance   100 levels, magnetic resistance
Display type   HD touch screen
Peloton  exercise bikes are popular among fitness enthusiasts for their interactive features and extensive collection of on-demand and live cycling workouts.
The premium bike is constructed with high quality materials, including a sturdy carbon steel frame, which is durable enough to withstand vigorous workouts.
The Peloton Bike offers a 22-in (56-cm) HD touch screen, built-in speakers, and a nearly silent belt drive that allows for a quieter ride.
This Peloton exercise book connects to Wi-Fi- or Bluetooth-enabled devices to help seamlessly track and monitor your progress.
Peloton’s All-Access Membership is available for an additional $44 per month and includes access to live weekly classes and a variety of other streaming workouts directly from your Peloton equipment. Peloton also has a smartphone app with free and paid tiers starting at $12.99 per month, designed for use without Peloton equipment..
The Peloton Bike comes with a 12-month limited warranty.
Though you may have heard that Peloton  recalled its first-generation pedals  from roughly 27,000 bikes in October 2020, the recall applied only to bikes sold between July 2013 and May 2016 — not to new products.
“I love my Peloton Bike and have used it consistently for 1.5 years. Between the bike and the app classes, I probably do Peloton workouts four to five times per week. I set my alarm for 5:30 a.m. so I can have time to ride before my kids get up, and I love that 30 minutes (plus a warmup and cooldown) are all I need — there’s no commute time.
“What I love is the playlists are great and there is an instructor or ride for every mood I’m in. I don’t get bored. I also am super competitive so love to take rides friends have done and try and beat their leaderboard score.”
— Lisa Valente, MS, RD, Healthline Medical Integrity Manager (purchased the bike herself)
“I always recommend the Peloton products to anyone looking to upgrade their home fitness.
“While you can get a similar experience with a virtual fitness membership and a comparable machine, the quality of Peloton and the experience associated is unmatched. The bike itself is extremely well made and outperforms similar luxury products that cost significantly more.
“I have been an avid attendee of cycling classes for the better part of the last decade, and I spent a long time debating if the Peloton Bike was a worthwhile investment for me.
“That being said, I have absolutely loved my experience with the product. I look forward to my workouts and love how I am able to fit a quick sweat in regardless of my schedule. The app also allows me to take classes on the go if need be!”
— Emma Satin, Healthline editor (purchased the bike herself)

Best Peloton alternative
Maximum weight capacity   350 lb (158.8 kg)
Pedal type   dual-sided with SPD clips and toe cages
Resistance   100 levels, magnetic resistance
Display type   HD touch screen
The Stryde indoor cycling bike is one of the best Peloton alternatives, as it offers the same high quality cycling experience at a lower overall cost than the Peloton Bike+.
When compared to the regular Peloton Bike (not the Bike+), the Stryde bike is slightly pricier up front. But unlike Peloton bikes, the Stryde bike doesn’t require special cycling shoes —  Stryde  offers dual-sided pedals so you can use either SPD clips or regular gym shoes.
Stryde offers a $29.99 optional monthly membership fee that allows you to stream the Stryde app or other fitness apps and streaming services, like Netflix, if you want to watch a favorite show while you ride. The Stryde bike will also work without any app at all, but you won’t have access to streaming services.
The Stryde bike itself features a welded powder-coated steel frame, providing plenty of stability and durability.
It also includes 100 levels of magnetic resistance, a cushioned sports saddle, and a 21.5-in (55-cm) HD touch screen for streaming classes.
You have the option to subscribe to the Stryde app for $29 per month, which provides access to hundreds of fitness routines. You can also use the touch screen to connect to other  fitness apps  and streaming platforms (a capability Peloton lacks).

Best air bike
Maximum weight capacity   330 lb (149.7 kg)
Resistance   fan resistance
Display type   LCD
Pedal type   clipless
The Rogue Echo Bike is an upright  air bike  that runs smoothly and quietly using a belt-driven steel fan.
It features an LCD monitor that provides metrics including intervals, distance, calories burned, and heart rate. The new version 3.0 has added Bluetooth or ANT+ wireless compatibility, allowing users to connect to various cycling apps for more performance feedback.
The  Rogue Echo Bike  is solidly built of heavy-duty steel that offers stability during intense workouts. While it’s on the heavy side, the machine is equipped with transport wheels for convenient portability.
Customers particularly appreciate that this bike requires little maintenance, doesn’t need an electrical outlet, and is extremely durable, offering plenty of quality for the price.

Best under-desk bike
Maximum weight capacity   350 lb (158.8 kg)
Pedal type   caged
Resistance   8 levels, magnetic resistance
Display type   LCD
The Under-Desk Bike is a quality machine that provides a quiet, smooth ride at a reasonable cost.
Compact and portable, this under-desk cycle bike is a great way to squeeze in some extra activity while you work or watch TV.
It’s very quiet and features magnetic resistance with eight intensity levels so you can easily adjust your workout.
It also has an easy-to-read LCD monitor, which displays details about your ride, such as:
your workout duration
speed
distance
calories burned
Just keep in mind that while this piece of equipment can help keep you active as you work, it likely won’t give you the challenge you need for a true workout. The pedal rotation range of motion is pretty limited, so it won’t have the same effect as the other bikes on our list.
The  Flexispot Adjustable Exercise Bike  is a bit of a splurgier, exercise chair alternative to the DeskCycle. The chair is minimalist, but it does the job of getting you seated at your workspace, with a padded seat and a mesh backrest with lumbar support. If you’re also in the market for a home office chair, the FlexiSpot exercise bike may be worth the investment.
Healthline writer Ellen Landes, MS, RDN, CPT, tried an older version of the FlexiSpot exercise bike. She felt that overall it had a simple design with few bells and whistles, but found it comfortable and convenient to use throughout an otherwise sedentary day.
“It has wheels and is easy to move around if needed (say, if you wanted to use it while watching TV as well). If you don’t also need a new office chair, it may be better to opt for the more affordable DeskCycle that you can cart around from room to room,” Landes explained.

Price:  We included a range of bikes to suit a variety of budgets.
Vetting:  The bikes on our list have been vetted to ensure that they align with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being. You can read more about  our vetting process .

Types of exercise bikes
Before making a stationary bike purchase for your home, it’s important to get the lay of the land and understand the different types and styles available. Each has benefits and drawbacks.
Cycling bikes, sometimes called spin bikes, are commonly seen at cycling studios and are intended to mimic the experience of riding a bike outside. They typically feature a narrower, less-cushioned seat. They also offer adjustable seat and handle options to accommodate a wide range of user heights.
Some bikes’ pedals are compatible with cycling shoes, enabling you to clip in for your ride. They’re also available in “bare bones” configurations with nothing more than a battery-operated LCD screen to track:
speed
distance
calories burned
Lastly, they can be found as “smart bikes” for home use, with:
large HD touch screens
built-in speakers
app compatibility for streaming workouts
Upright bikes are what you might typically find in the  cardio  section of your local gym. The seat is wider and more cushioned than a cycling bike, and they often require the use of an electrical outlet to run and track their pre-set programs.
They’re often considered more comfortable than a cycling bike, but they don’t truly mimic the feel of riding a bike outside.
Recumbent bikes  function similar to upright bikes (often using an electrical outlet to power their programs), but they provide a wide, padded seat with a backrest, and the pedals are positioned underneath the console rather than underneath the seat.
You’ll end up sitting back and extending your legs in front of you in a seated position to perform the workout. Some individuals find this a more comfortable way to do a cycling workout.
Some home bikes offer an upright and recumbent hybrid option. Unlike true recumbent bikes, which you use in a seated, reclined position, you remain upright even when using the recumbent features. Hybrid bikes offer a backrest and a second set of handles positioned to the outside of the padded seat.
To use the bike in its upright position, you simply use the standard handlebars and refrain from using the backrest. To use the bike in its recumbent position, you lean back against the backrest and grip the handlebars to the sides of the seat. This type of bike may be appealing to those who plan to share the bike with multiple family members.
Air-powered bikes have been around for a while, but they have recently gained popularity in  high intensity workout  programs. They don’t require electricity and instead feature a large fan as the front flywheel. Many also include moveable handlebars that enable you to get an upper body and lower body workout in at the same time.
Resistance is generated by you as you pedal and move the handlebars, causing the fan to turn and create air resistance. The harder you work, the more resistance you create, and the harder the workout becomes.

Special features
In addition to styles of exercise bikes, there are specific features you may want to consider when selecting a bike:
Streaming-capable bikes:  These “smart bikes” are Wi-Fi- and Bluetooth-enabled and can be integrated with online apps or workout programs. Many options, like Peloton, give users access to live or streaming workouts, and some offer auto-resistance changes that control your bike’s resistance levels based on the workout and your heart rate.
Folding bikes:  Folding bikes are a great option if you’re short on space. They’re typically lighter weight, fold down to half their size, and also provide transport wheels so you can move them to an inconspicuous location.
Under-desk or work-compatible bikes:  These small, lightweight “bikes” are really a set of portable pedals. They tend to be a good way to remain active while sitting at a desk, but due to their small, compact size, they may not offer a full pedaling range of motion or the  core engagement  required of full-sized exercise bikes.

When to use an exercise bike
Exercise bikes can be a great option if you’re looking for a convenient way to fit in a high quality workout at home.
Cycling is also lower impact than some other types of exercise, such as  jogging , making it a good choice for people with  chronic joint pain  or injuries.
Plus, though it typically burns fewer calories than jogging, cycling can help build strength in your lower body.
Compared to other at-home  workout equipment , exercise bikes generally have a smaller footprint and require less space. Therefore, they may be worth trying if you live in a small house or apartment with limited space.
Under-desk cycles can also be a convenient option to help  burn extra calories  while you work or study, especially if you feel antsy  sitting for long periods  during the day.

How to choose the best exercise bike for home
With so many  exercise bikes  on the market, it can be difficult to determine which one is right for you. Here are some factors to keep in mind:
Specs:  Be sure to look for a bike that’s comfortable, adjustable, and suitable for your height and weight. You may also want to find a bike with a variety of resistance levels, which you can use to customize the intensity of your workout.
Style:  Consider whether you want a recumbent or upright bike. Although many people prefer upright bikes, recumbent bikes are often more comfortable and may be more suitable for those with lower back pain.
Features:  Many bikes also offer special features, such as pulse sensors, Bluetooth connectivity, or built-in screens with access to streaming classes. If you’re choosing a smart bike, be sure to note which apps it’s compatible with.
Price:  Keep in mind that exercise bikes can range quite a bit in price, so be sure to consider your budget carefully. Extra features typically come at an additional cost, and the ability to stream workout classes may require a monthly subscription fee as well.

Exercise bike maintenance
Before using your exercise bike, it’s important to set it up properly. The guidelines for setup may differ depending on whether you have an upright or recumbent bike.
If you’re using an upright bike, stand to the right of the bike and raise or lower the saddle until it’s at hip level.
Next, try sitting in the saddle to check your position and place one pedal at the lowest position. Ideally, there should be a slight bend in your knee if the bike is positioned correctly.
To adjust the distance of the saddle, remain seated and position the pedals at 9 o’clock and 3 o’clock. Move your saddle forward or backward as needed until you can draw an imaginary line from the front of your knee to the middle of each pedal.
Lastly, you should adjust the height of your handlebars so that your  spine is in a neutral  position and your elbows are comfortable, with a slight bend.
If you’re using a recumbent bike, the handlebars should be slightly higher, and your elbows should be able to bend comfortably.
When adjusting the position of the seat, make sure you’re close enough that your knees are slightly bent and there’s no discomfort once you start pedaling.
Properly caring for your exercise bike can help keep it in good shape, especially if you use it regularly.
It’s generally recommended to wipe down your bike after each ride using a dry or damp cloth on the frame, handlebars, and seat. This prevents rust and corrosion to the bike over time.
You should also regularly tighten the pedals using a pedal wrench, especially if they feel loose. It’s also recommended to tighten the seat hardware, water bottle holders, and other nuts and bolts on your bike as needed to keep everything secure.
You may also need to occasionally clean and lubricate moving parts of the bike, including the seat post, handlebar post, seat slider, and brake tension rod. If you have a chain drive bike, you should also regularly lubricate the drive chain.
If your bike has a battery-operated digital display, be sure to replace the batteries when necessary.

When to avoid using an exercise bike
It’s generally recommended to check with a doctor  before starting a new exercise regimen , especially if you have certain health conditions, such as  heart disease  or  kidney disease .
Cycling can worsen  knee pain  or lower back pain in some cases. Therefore, it’s important to practice proper form when using your  indoor exercise bike , especially if you have osteoarthritis or other joint problems.
Additionally, indoor exercise bikes may not be a good fit for you if you:
have limited space
prefer full-body workouts
find that cycling indoors feels tedious or monotonous

Indoor cycling bikes and exercise bikes are stationary indoor bikes with several key differences.

An upright exercise bike has a large, comfortable seat that’s lower to the ground, allowing you to sit upright. Recumbent exercise bikes feature a reclined position. These positions put less stress on your shoulders, back, and joints.

Exercise bikes have resistance options that suit low- to moderate-intensity workouts and longer endurance rides at a steady pace. They are suitable for most fitness levels.

In terms of positioning, riding a cycling bike is similar to riding an outdoor road bike. Typically, the seat is far back to allow you to lean forward or stand.

An indoor cycling bike has a heavy flywheel, so you need to use more energy to get the bike going. Indoor cycling bikes are a good option for high intensity and interval workouts.

Cycling and walking  are both beneficial forms of exercise. Riding an exercise bike provides similar advantages to walking, but it affects your joints less.

Compared with walking, biking at a high intensity may build more strength and burn more calories in a shorter time. Since walking is a form of weight bearing exercise, it may be a better choice if you’re looking to  build bone density .

You may find that cycling or walking is more enjoyable or comfortable for you, which can also help inform your decision.

Bike workouts can range in difficulty depending on the level of resistance and duration of the workout.
Most bike workouts begin with a warmup to get your blood flowing and heart pumping. Warming up also helps prevent injury and preps your body for exercise.
After a brief warmup, you can go into blocks or sets that are more challenging. To increase the difficulty of your workout, turn up the resistance on your exercise bike. This creates more tension, and though you may slow your pace, it stimulates the challenge of climbing hills.
You can also challenge yourself by switching from a seated to standing position during your workout. If increasing speed is your goal, you can lower the resistance and pedal faster.
The best bike workout ultimately depends on your goals, such as increasing endurance or weight loss, for example. For beginners, it’s best to follow workouts created by personal trainers. Most bikes, such as the Peloton exercise bike, have a coordinating app or program with hundreds or thousands of bike workouts.

Many factors go into choosing the best exercise bike for home and many of them depend on your personal preference and home.
The best exercise bike for seniors, for example, may be a recumbent bike. These bikes are easier on the back and joints, making for a more comfortable and low-impact ride.
Indoor cycling bikes, or spin bikes, on the other hand, may be more familiar to someone who’s used to riding a traditional outdoor bike. Many allow you to clip in with special shoes, which can take some getting used to but makes for more effective pedaling.
Upright bikes are also a popular option because they’re comfortable yet challenging. You can get a great cardio workout on an upright bike, though it’s suitable for people of all exercise levels.
For most people looking to add a new piece of equipment to their home gym, the best option is commonly a recumbent, upright, or indoor cycling bike.

The  Physical Guidelines for Americans  recommends that each week adults get 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity.
This means if you pedal at a moderate pace  on your exercise bike just 30 minutes on five days of the week, you’ve met the recommendation. If you pedal more vigorously, like in a race or up hills on your exercise bike app, just 2 hours fulfills the requirement.
The  Centers for Disease Contol and Prevention (CDC)  points out that you need to feel comfortable doing moderate-intensity activities before you move on to more vigorous ones.
