Title: 10 Healthy High Leucine Foods

Leucine is an amino acid important for your muscle health and blood sugar levels. Many foods contain it, including eggs, seeds, oats, and legumes.
You may have heard about an essential amino acid called leucine when browsing new fitness supplements or reading up on how to manage your blood sugar levels.
Amino acids are the building blocks of protein. Your body can make some types by itself, while it needs to obtain others from your diet. These are called essential amino acids.
Leucine is a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) — just like valine and isoleucine — and is important for repairing and building muscle. In fact, getting enough leucine may prevent muscle wasting among older adults ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
Leucine also appears to help manage blood sugar levels. It’s speculated to do so by facilitating glucose uptake into your body’s cells and improving insulin response ( 4 ,  5 ).
For most adults, the current recommendation for leucine is a minimum daily intake of 25 mg per pound (55 mg per kg) of body weight, or approximately 4.4 grams per day for a 175-pound (80-kg) person ( 6 ,  7 ).
However, in a more recent study, the World Health Organization states that healthy adults should get 18 mg of leucine per pound (39 mg per kg) of body weight per day. This equates to approximately 3.1 grams per day for a 175-pound (80-kg) person ( 8 ).
Fortunately, deficiency in this amino acid is rare because of the wide array of foods that contain it. Here are 10 high leucine foods.

1. Canned navy beans
A 1/3-cup (100-gram) serving of canned navy  beans  offers 0.7 grams of leucine ( 9 ).
They’re also a good source of protein, fiber, and micronutrients like folate and other B vitamins, manganese, iron, phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium.
Eating navy beans has been shown to protect heart health and improve metabolic risk factors associated with obesity, such as elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels ( 10 ,  11 ).
They also contain phosphatidylserine, a fatty compound that may benefit aspects of brain health like memory, focus, and problem-solving and communication skills ( 12 ).
Navy beans have a neutral flavor that lends itself well to countless meals. For a nutrient boost, try enjoying them in soups, salads, marinated as a side dish, or puréed into a white bean dip.

The bottom line
Leucine is an essential  branched-chain amino acid  (BCAA). This means that it’s especially important for muscle repair and building and that your body can’t produce it by itself. Thus, you have to get it from your diet.
While leucine deficiency is rare, getting enough of it is important to help manage your blood sugar levels and prevent muscle wasting, especially among older adults.
Fortunately, plenty of healthy, tasty foods contain leucine, including eggs, seeds, oats, legumes, and spirulina, and they’re all easy to incorporate into your diet.
Try this today:  For a serious boost of leucine, try cooking up a wholesome portion of oatmeal or overnight oats. Sprinkle it with hemp or pumpkin seeds and add a generous spoon of natural peanut butter. For extra flavor and nutrients, add ingredients like fresh fruit, nuts, and milk. Here are some  recipes  to get you started!
