Title: 10 of the Best Chromium Supplements

Chromium is a mineral that plays a key role in nutrient metabolism. It’s found naturally in a variety of foods, including broccoli, garlic, and potatoes ( 1 ,  2 ).
Many people take chromium as a supplement to help improve their blood sugar levels or prevent metabolic syndrome, a group of symptoms that increases the risk of heart disease and diabetes ( 3 ).
Athletes and bodybuilders also commonly use chromium for its purported performance-boosting benefits ( 3 ).
However, not all chromium supplements are created equal, and selecting a product that is safe and effective can be challenging.
This article will review 10 of the best chromium supplements, along with the key factors you should consider to determine which one is right for you.

How to choose
When selecting a chromium supplement, it’s important to consider several factors.
First, be sure to check the ingredient list. Look for products without artificial ingredients, additives, or fillers.
You’ll also want to pay attention to the form. Chromium supplements are available in several forms:
chromium picolinate
chromium chloride
chromium nicotinate/polynicotinate
chromium chelavite
chromium citrate
Although some older studies suggest that your body may absorb chromium picolinate best, there’s concern that this form may also cause oxidative damage to your cells ( 4 ).
Certain supplements may also contain additional ingredients to enhance their potential health benefits, such as  cinnamon  or other medicinal herbs ( 5 ).
You should also look for products that have undergone third-party testing, are certified by organizations such as U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) or NSF International, and are manufactured in facilities that adhere to Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs), a set of standards issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Finally, it’s important to check the product dose carefully.
Although daily needs vary based on age and sex, the recommended Daily Value (DV) for chromium is 35 mcg. However, many supplements pack significantly larger amounts, with doses ranging from 200–1,000 mcg ( 2 ).
Currently, chromium has no established Tolerable Upper Intake Level, which is the highest amount of a nutrient you can take without risk of adverse health effects ( 2 ).
Chromium may interact with certain medications, including antacids, beta-blockers, proton pump inhibitors,  insulin , and corticosteroids ( 2 ).
If you’re taking any of these medications or have any underlying health conditions, consult a healthcare professional before taking chromium.

Chromium supplement benefits
Chromium is a trace mineral that plays a key role in the metabolism of proteins, fats, and carbs ( 2 ).
For this reason, chromium supplements are commonly used to support blood sugar management in people with type 2 diabetes.
According to one review of 28 studies, chromium supplements were effective at improving fasting blood sugar levels, insulin resistance, and hemoglobin A1C — a marker of long-term blood sugar control — in people with type 2 diabetes ( 16 ).
Some research suggests that chromium supplements may also help support weight loss and loss of body fat.
For instance, one review of 19 studies concluded that chromium supplementation could help reduce body weight and body fat percentage in people with obesity, especially when used for at least 12 weeks and in doses of at least 400 mcg per day ( 17 ).
Chromium is also sometimes used by athletes and is thought to promote strength and endurance. However, research results are conflicting and more recent, high quality studies are needed ( 18 ).

Chromium supplement side effects
There is currently no established  Tolerable Upper Intake Level for chromium, and chromium supplements are generally considered safe for healthy adults when used as directed ( 2 ).
However, there have been case reports of adverse side effects associated with the use of chromium supplements, including ( 2 ):
weight loss
liver problems
kidney failure
skin irritation
low blood sugar levels
rhabdomyolysis, or muscle breakdown
low blood platelet count
People with liver disease or kidney disease may be more susceptible to side effects caused by high chromium intake ( 2 ).
Chromium may also interact with several types of medications, including drugs used to treat diabetes or thyroid problems ( 2 ).
Be sure to use chromium supplements only as directed and talk with a healthcare professional before starting supplementation, especially if you are taking other medications.

Frequently asked questions
Though individual needs for chromium can vary based on many factors, including age and sex, the recommended DV for chromium is 35 mcg ( 2 ).
Because most supplements provide a much larger amount, it’s best to talk with a healthcare professional before taking chromium to determine the right dosage for you.
Chromium picolinate is a specific type of chromium often found in supplements. It contains both chromium and picolinic acid and is believed to be more easily absorbed than other forms of chromium ( 2 ).
Chromium picolinate is considered one of the most well-absorbed forms of chromium. However, there are many other forms available, including chromium chloride, chromium nicotinate, chromium chelavite, and chromium citrate ( 2 ).
Chromium can interact with several types of medications, including insulin, corticosteroids, proton pump inhibitors, beta-blockers, and antacids. Additionally, it may not be suitable for those with kidney disease or liver disease ( 2 ,  19 ).
For this reason, if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking other medications, it’s best to talk with a healthcare professional before taking chromium supplements.
Chromium can interact with certain supplements and medications. To avoid any adverse effects, you should consult a healthcare professional before taking chromium supplements ( 19 ).

The bottom line
The numerous chromium supplements on the market vary in dosage and form.
Some contain added ingredients, such as cinnamon or other  herbs and spices , which may amplify their potential benefits.
Keep in mind that all the supplements listed above contain far more than the recommended DV of 35 mcg. If you’re concerned about proper dosage — or if you’re taking any other medications — be sure to consult a healthcare professional before taking chromium.
It’s also important to pair these supplements with a  nutritious and balanced diet .
