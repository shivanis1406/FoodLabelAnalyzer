Title: Counting Calories 101: How to Count Calories to Lose Weight

Counting calories can help if you want to lose weight. You can begin by planning your weekly meals and counting calories per serving. But it’s important to make sure you’re still fulfilling your daily energy needs.
To lose weight, you typically need to eat fewer calories than you burn. In theory, this sounds simple. But in the modern food environment, managing your food intake can be tricky.
This detailed guide to counting calories explains everything you need to know.
Keep in mind that counting calories is just one way to lose weight. It may not work for everyone and is not the only way to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle.
Always consider your food quality, portions, and fullness signals as well when trying to lose weight. You can speak with a healthcare professional, such as a dietitian, to help identify your individual food needs and goals.
These behaviors may indicate a disordered relationship with food or an eating disorder.
Disordered eating and eating disorders can affect anyone, regardless of gender identity, race, age, socioeconomic status, or other identities.
They can be caused by any combination of biological, social, cultural, and environmental factors — not just by exposure to diet culture.
Consider speaking with a healthcare professional or contacting the  National Alliance for Eating Disorders , which offers a daytime helpline staffed by licensed therapists and an online search tool for treatment options. For general mental health support at any time, you can call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 24 hours per day at 800-662-4357 (TTY: 800-487-4889).

What are calories?
Calories  are a  measure of energy , typically used to measure the energy content of foods and beverages.
Your body uses the calories that you eat and drink for essential functions, such as breathing and thinking, as well as day-to-day activities, such as walking, talking, and eating.
Any excess calories you eat will be stored as fat. So consistently eating more than you burn may cause weight gain over time.

What is my recommended caloric intake?
How many calories you need depends on factors like gender, age, weight, and activity level.
If you are trying to lose weight, you will typically need to create a  calorie deficit  by eating less than your body burns off.
Use  this calculator  to determine how many calories you should eat per day.
The World Health Organization recommends that a healthy diet should involve:
eating  five portions  of fruits and vegetables per day
not getting more than 5% of calories from added sugar
getting around 30% of your total energy intake from fats, such as fish and oils
eating 5 grams of iodized salt (equivalent to about 1 teaspoon) per day

Why calories count
It’s quite common to hear that calories don’t matter and  that calorie counting is a waste of time. However, when it comes to your weight,  calories do count . This fact  has been proven time and time again in scientific experiments called overfeeding studies.
These studies ask people to deliberately overeat and subsequently measure the effect on their weight and health. All overfeeding studies have found that when people eat more calories than they burn off, they gain weight.
A 2017 study found that  people who counted their calories for a minimum of  5 days  showed significant and sustained weight loss over time compared with those who did not count their calories or  stopped counting before day 5.
However, calorie counting isn’t the only effective method for weight loss. It’s  also important  to incorporate quality foods into your diet,  exercise regularly , and maintain good  sleep hygiene .

How to weigh and measure your portions
Portion sizes have increased over time. In some restaurants, a single meal can provide double or triple the average person’s daily needs.
“ Portion distortion ” is the term for when you view large servings of foods as the norm. It can cause weight gain and hinder weight loss.
It can be tricky to estimate how much you eat each day. Calorie counting can help you manage overeating by giving you a better understanding of how much you are consuming.
For it to work, you need to record food portions correctly. Here are a few common ways to measure portion sizes:
Scales:  Weighing your food is the most accurate way to determine how much you’re eating.
Measuring cups:  Standard volume measures may be slightly quicker and easier to use than a scale.
Comparisons:  Comparing common items is quick and easy, especially if you’re away from home. However, this can be much less accurate.
Here are some common serving sizes compared with household items that may help you estimate your portion sizes:
1 serving of green leafy vegetables (1 cup): a baseball
1 serving of rice or pasta (1/2 cup): a computer mouse or rounded handful
1 serving of vegetables (1/2 cup): a computer mouse
1 serving of fresh fruit (1/2 cup): a tennis ball
1 serving of meat (3 ounces): a deck of cards
1 serving of fish (3 ounces): a checkbook
1 serving of cheese (1.5 ounces): a lipstick tube or the size of your thumb
1 serving of peanut butter (2 tablespoons): a ping pong ball
1 serving of olive oil (1 teaspoon): 1 fingertip
Calorie counting isn’t an exact science, even when you weigh and measure portions.
But it’s not necessary to be entirely spot-on with your measurements. Just make sure to record your intake as accurately as you can.
Try to be most careful about recording items that are high in fat or sugar, such as pizza, ice cream, and oils. Under-recording these foods can cause a big difference between your recorded and actual intake.
To improve your estimations, you can try using a food scale in the beginning to give you a better idea of what a portion looks like for various foods. This can help you be more accurate, even after you stop using the scale.
Due to advances in technology, putting calorie counting into practice can be much easier these days. Lots of apps are available to simplify the process by providing quick and easy ways to log the food you eat.

Here are 5 more tips to help with counting calories:
Be prepared:  Before you start, consider getting a calorie-counting app or online tool, decide how you will measure or estimate portions, and make a meal plan.
Read food labels:  Food labels contain lots of useful information for calorie counting. Make sure you check the portion size recommended on the package.
Aim for slow, steady weight loss:  It may be helpful to aim for  slow and steady  weight loss and not cut calories too low. Your body still needs nutritious food to function.
Fuel your exercise:  The most successful weight loss programs include both diet and exercise. Make sure to eat enough to still have the energy to exercise.

The bottom line
Counting calories can be helpful if you want to lose weight.
But it may not work for everyone and is not the only way to maintain a healthy diet.
