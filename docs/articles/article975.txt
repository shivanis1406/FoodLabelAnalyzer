Title: How to Lose Weight with PCOS: 9 Helpful Tips

If you have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), lifestyle measures like changing your diet and starting an exercise routine may help you reach and maintain a moderate weight.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition involving hormonal imbalances, irregular periods, and the development of small cysts on one or both ovaries.
Research suggests that even a  5%  weight loss can improve insulin resistance, hormone levels, menstrual cycles, fertility, and overall quality of life in people with PCOS.
Here are 12 helpful tips for losing weight with PCOS.
Sex and gender exist on spectrums. This article uses the term “women” to refer to sex assigned at birth.

1. Reduce your carb intake
Decreasing your carbohydrate consumption may help manage  PCOS  due to its impact on insulin levels.
Insulin resistance occurs when your cells respond abnormally to the hormone insulin. Anywhere from  35–80%  of people with PCOS experience this.
Insulin  is necessary for blood sugar regulation and energy storage in your body. Research suggests that high levels of insulin are  linked to  increased body fat and weight gain in the general population and in people with PCOS.

2. Get plenty of fiber
As  fiber  helps you stay full after a meal, a high fiber diet may promote weight loss in people with PCOS.
In the United States, the dietary reference intake for fiber is  14 grams (g)  per 1,000 calories, or around 25 g per day for women. However, most Americans consume only about 15 g of fiber per day.
In a  2019 study , researchers linked higher fiber intake to lower insulin resistance, less total body fat, and less  belly fat  in people with PCOS.

3. Eat enough protein
Protein  helps stabilize  blood sugar and increases feelings of fullness after a meal.
It may also  aid weight loss  by reducing cravings, helping you burn more calories, and regulating hunger hormones.
In an older 2012 study,  57 people  with PCOS consumed either a high protein diet consisting of more than 40% of calories from protein and 30% from fat or a standard diet consisting of less than 15% from protein and 30% from fat.
Individuals in the high protein group lost an average of 9.7 pounds (4.4 kilograms) after 6 months — significantly more than those in the control group.
If you’re concerned you’re not getting enough protein, consider adding it to your meals or choosing high protein snacks. Healthy  high protein foods  include eggs, nuts, dairy, meat, and seafood.

4. Eat healthy fats
Having plenty of  healthy fats  in your diet may help you feel more satisfied after meals and tackle weight loss and other symptoms of PCOS.
Avocado, olive oil, coconut oil, and nut butter are some foods that contain healthy fats. Combining healthy fat with a protein source can further increase the filling effects of meals and snacks.

5. Eat fermented foods
Healthy gut bacteria  may play a role in metabolism and weight maintenance.
Studies suggest that people with PCOS may  have fewer  healthy gut bacteria than those without this condition.
Emerging research also suggests that certain probiotic strains may have  positive effects  on weight loss.
However, other research has produced  mixed results .
Still, eating foods high in probiotics — such as yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and other  fermented foods  — may help increase the amount of beneficial bacteria in your gut.

6. Limit processed foods and added sugars
Another tip to lose weight with PCOS is to cut down on your intake of less nutritious foods.
Processed foods and  added sugars  may raise blood sugar levels and  increase your risk  of insulin resistance, which is linked to obesity.
People with PCOS may process sugar differently than those without it.  Research  shows that women with PCOS experience larger spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels after consuming the same amount of sugar as women without this condition.
Experts recommend that people with PCOS  limit their consumption  of added sugars and refined carbs. This may help them manage symptoms and maintain a moderate body weight.
Foods high in added sugar and refined carbs include cakes, cookies, candy, and fast food.

7. Exercise regularly
Exercise  is a well-known strategy for increasing weight loss.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends  30 minutes  of moderate activity 5 days per week for a total of 150 minutes of moderate activity per week.
While people with PCOS lost less fat than those without this condition, the exercise regimen did result in loss of belly fat and improvements in insulin sensitivity.

8. Get enough sleep
Experts increasingly acknowledge sleep as central to overall health.
If you have PCOS, you  may experience  sleep disturbances, including  excessive daytime sleepiness , sleep apnea, and insomnia.
Lack of sleep has been shown to  increase the activity  of hormones that drive hunger, such as ghrelin and cortisol, which may cause you to eat more throughout the day.
In fact, researchers have linked insufficient sleep with a  higher risk  of having overweight or obesity.
The CDC suggests that adults should aim for at least  7 hours  of sleep each night.

9. Manage your stress
Stress  can be a risk factor for weight gain. This means reducing stress levels may help you manage your weight.
Stress increases levels of cortisol, a hormone that your adrenal glands produce. Chronically high cortisol levels are  linked to  insulin resistance and weight gain.
Chronic stress also  increases your risk  of gaining belly fat. In turn, belly fat increases inflammation, which triggers your body to make more cortisol, creating a vicious cycle.
To lower your cortisol levels, consider incorporating stress management techniques into your day-to-day life, such as:
practicing yoga
spending time in nature
practicing meditation
spending more time doing things you enjoy

Frequently asked questions
People who have PCOS may find it difficult to lose weight due to hormonal imbalances caused by the condition. While this can make reaching and maintaining a moderate weight challenging, lifestyle measures like making dietary changes, exercising, and getting enough sleep can help.
PCOS belly can look different from typical weight gain. It commonly resembles a protruding stomach, and you may find that most of your weight gain accumulates in this area.
If you have PCOS, it can be helpful to avoid or limit processed foods and those that are high in sugar. This includes foods such as cakes, cookies, candy, and fast food.

The bottom line
PCOS can make it difficult for people to lose weight.
A balanced, nutritious diet that is low in inflammatory foods — such as refined carbs and highly processed foods — and rich in whole foods, protein, healthy fats, and fiber may aid weight loss.
It’s also important to consider lifestyle factors. Regular exercise, stress management, and sleep are all important when it comes to healthy weight loss.
