Title: Apples 101: Nutrition Facts and Health Benefits

Apples contain key nutrients, including fiber and antioxidants. They may offer health benefits, including lowering blood sugar levels and benefitting heart health.
Apples are among the world’s most popular fruits.
They grow on the apple tree ( Malus domestica ), originally from Central Asia.
Apples are high in fiber, vitamin C, and various antioxidants. They are also very filling, considering their low calorie count.  Studies   show  that eating apples can have multiple benefits for your health.
Usually eaten raw, apples can also be used in various recipes, juices, and drinks. Various types abound, with a variety of colors and sizes.
This article tells you everything you need to know about apples.

Apple nutrition facts
Here are the  nutrition facts  for one raw, unpeeled, medium-sized apple (182 grams):
Calories:  94.6
Water:  156 grams
Protein:  0.43 grams
Carbs:  25.1 grams
Sugar:  18.9 grams
Fiber:  4.37 grams
Fat:  0.3 grams
Apples are mainly composed of  carbs  and water. They’re rich in simple sugars, such as fructose, sucrose, and glucose.
Despite their high carb and sugar contents, their glycemic index (GI) is low, ranging  29–44 .
The GI is a measure of how food affects the rise in blood sugar levels after eating.  Low values  are associated with various health benefits.
Due to their high fiber and polyphenol counts, fruits often have a low GI score.
Apples are very rich in fiber. A single medium-sized apple (182 grams) contains  4.37 grams  of this nutrient, which is approximately  16% of the Daily Value (DV) .
A portion of their fiber comes from insoluble and soluble fibers called pectin.  Soluble fiber  is associated with numerous health benefits, partly because it feeds the friendly bacteria in your gut.
Fiber  may also help improve fullness and cause weight loss while lowering blood sugar levels and boosting digestive function.
Apples are mainly made up of carbs and water. They also contain fiber, which moderates blood sugar levels and promotes gut health.

Vitamins and minerals
Apples boast many vitamins and minerals, though not in high amounts. However, apples are usually a good source of vitamin C.
Vitamin C.  Also called ascorbic acid, this vitamin is a common  antioxidant  in fruits. It’s an essential dietary nutrient that has many important functions in your body.
Potassium.  The main mineral in apples,  potassium  may benefit heart health when consumed in high amounts.
Apples are not particularly rich in vitamins and minerals. However, they contain decent amounts of both vitamin C and potassium.

Other plant compounds
Apples are high in various antioxidant plant compounds, which are responsible for many of their health benefits. These include:
Quercetin.  A nutrient that also occurs in many plant foods, quercetin may have anti-inflammatory, antiviral, anticancer, and antidepressant effects.
Catechin.  A natural antioxidant, catechin is also present in large amounts in  green tea  and  has been shown  to improve mitochondrial health.
Chlorogenic acid.  Also found in  coffee , chlorogenic acid has been found to lower blood sugar and cause weight loss in  some studies .
Apples are a good source of several antioxidants, including quercetin, catechin, and chlorogenic acid. These plant compounds are responsible for many of apples’ benefits.

Apples and weight loss
Two properties of apples — their high fiber and low calorie contents — make them a  weight-loss-friendly  food.
In one  12-week study , women who were instructed to eat 1.5 large apples (300 grams) per day lost 2.9 pounds (1.3 kg) over the course of the study.
For this reason, this fruit might be a beneficial dessert or addition to a meal to add sweetness.
Apples may compliment a healthy weight loss diet largely due to their high fiber and low calorie counts.

Health benefits of apples
Given the immense popularity of apples, it unsurprising that they’ve been studied quite thoroughly.
Some evidence  suggests that eating apples can help  lower blood sugar levels  and protect against diabetes.
Some of the antioxidants in apples may also  slow down your digestion and absorption  of sugars.
In  one study in 38,018 women , eating 1 or more apples per day was linked to a 28% lower risk of developing  type 2 diabetes .
Studies have examined apples’ effects on risk factors for heart disease.
A  2020 study  of volunteers with high cholesterol found that apples can  reduce total cholesterol levels  and improve overall blood flow. However, the study saw no discernible effect on blood pressure.
Many  test-tube  and  animal studies  suggest that apple phytonutrients can protect against cancers of the lungs and colon.
Potential evidence exists from studies in people as well.
One 2005 study  indicated that those who consumed 1 or more apples per day were at a  lower risk of cancer , including a 20% and 18% lower risk of colorectal and breast cancers, respectively.
Some studies indicate that apples may help protect against diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.

Potential downsides
Apples are generally well tolerated.
However, they may cause problems for people with  irritable bowel syndrome  (IBS) because they contain  FODMAPs , a wide category of fibers that cause digestive symptoms, including gas and abdominal pain, in some people.
Their fructose content may also be problematic for people with fructose intolerance.
Apples are generally considered healthy but may cause digestive problems in some people.

The bottom line
Apples are healthy, tasty, and among  the most popular fruits  in the world.
Although they are not particularly rich in vitamins and minerals, they’re a good source of fibers and antioxidants.
Apples may have  several benefits , including improved heart health and a lower risk of cancer and diabetes. They may also aid weight loss.
If you want to eat healthy, apples are an excellent choice.
