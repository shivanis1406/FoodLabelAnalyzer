Title: Eating the Rainbow — Is It Useful and Should You Try It?

To illustrate the importance of eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, health professionals often advise you to “eat the rainbow.”
You probably know that you should eat colorful fruits and vegetables, but you may wonder why it’s so important and if doing so truly benefits your health.
This article reviews the concept of eating the rainbow, its benefits, and how to do it.

Benefits of eating the rainbow
Simply put, eating the rainbow involves eating fruits and vegetables of different colors every day.
Plants contain different pigments, or  phytonutrients , which give them their color. Different-colored plants are linked to higher levels of specific nutrients and health benefits.
While  eating more vegetables  and fruit is always a good idea, focusing on eating a variety of colors will increase your intake of different nutrients to benefit various areas of your health.
While there are many purported benefits of phytonutrients, it’s difficult to perform randomized controlled trials — the most rigorous type of research — to prove their efficacy. As such, most research is based on population-level intakes and disease risk ( 1 ).
That said, almost all studies show benefits from regularly eating colorful fruits and vegetables with virtually no downsides. By getting a variety of color in your diet, you’re giving your body an array of vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals to benefit your health ( 1 ).
Here’s an overview of the health benefits of different-colored foods ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ):
To eat the rainbow, be sure to eat a variety of different-colored fruits and vegetables throughout your day. Most colorful fruits and veggies have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that may benefit different aspects of your health.

How to do it
The great thing about eating the rainbow is it’s easy to implement.
To eat the rainbow, try to incorporate two to three different-colored fruits or vegetables at every meal and at least one at every snack. While you don’t have to eat every single color every day, try to get them into your diet a few times per week. Here are some ideas:
an omelet with spinach, mushrooms, and orange bell peppers
a smoothie with  mango , banana, and dragonfruit
a Greek yogurt bowl with blueberries, kiwi, and strawberries
a breakfast egg sandwich with tomato, leafy greens, and avocado
a mixed salad with green cabbage, lettuce, apple, shredded carrots, red pepper, cucumbers, and cherry tomatoes paired with a protein source (e.g., kidney beans, chickpeas, grilled chicken, salmon)
chicken with roasted sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and garlic
homemade soup with canned tomatoes, onion, garlic, chopped carrots, white potatoes or parsnip, and kale
a goat cheese salad with pickled beets, arugula, avocado, and pecans
spaghetti with tomato sauce, mushrooms, and  zucchini
an apple with peanut butter
red pepper slices with hummus
grapes and cheese
a green smoothie or juice
a banana
blueberries and yogurt
broccoli, carrots, and dip
dried mango slices
4–5  longan or lychee  fruit
edamame pods
celery and melted cheese
The opportunities to include fruits and vegetables into your diet are endless. If you live in an area without fresh produce year-round, try purchasing frozen fruits and vegetables for some meals. They’re equally nutritious, accessible, and affordable.
Try to eat two to three different-colored fruits or vegetables at every meal, as well as one to two at every snack.

The bottom line
Remembering to eat the rainbow every day is a great and simple way to make sure you’re getting a variety of nutrients into your diet.
Fruits and vegetables of different colors confer various health benefits. By ensuring you’re eating a few colored fruits or vegetables at each meal, you’re setting yourself up for good health.
To try eating the rainbow, work toward adding at least two or three colored fruits or vegetables to each meal and at least one or two to each snack.
