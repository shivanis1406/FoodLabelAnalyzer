Title: The 13 Healthiest Fast-Food Burgers, According to a Dietitian

Fast food may not be an ideal choice, but sometimes hitting the drive-through is unavoidable. In that case, it might come in handy to know how to choose the healthiest fast-food burger.
Burgers might have a bad reputation as an “unhealthy” food, but the nutritional value of your burger really depends on what’s in it.
Beef itself is actually a rich source of protein and nutrients.
The health effects of red meat are controversial, particularly the question of whether red meat consumption is related to heart disease, so consider moderating your intake ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ).
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends choosing lean over full fat meat when you can ( 7 ).
Nevertheless, the least healthy part of most fast-food hamburgers is likely the highly processed, refined-flour bun ( 8 ,  9 ).
To help you make a more informed decision at the drive-through, we’ve assembled this list of the healthiest fast-food hamburgers.

Our selection criteria
The burgers we’ve chosen meet the following criteria:
Available nationwide.  Although we included some burgers from smaller, more regional chains, most of the burgers on this list are from restaurants you can find in large cities and small towns across the United States.
Protein content.  With the exception of the low calorie burger and plant-based slider on the list, we included fast-food burgers that have at least 20 grams of protein.  Protein  helps keep you full, giving your burger some staying power ( 10 ).
Calorie content.  All of the burgers on this list contain fewer than 700 calories. The calorie content isn’t the only metric to determine how healthy a food is, but excessive calorie intake can lead to unwanted weight gain and its associated health risks ( 11 ).
Suitability for different diets.  We included some plant-based and keto-friendly options on this list, too. However, if you are a strict  vegan , be aware that there will likely be cross contamination with animal products from a shared grill at most of these restaurants.
Here are the healthiest fast-food burgers of 2021.

Overall healthiest burger: Freddy’s Single Steakburger
The Single Steakburger from Freddy’s contains a hand-formed patty, mustard, onion, and pickle on a toasted bun. It provides ( 12 ):
Calories:  400
Fat:  19 grams
Protein:  26 grams
Carbs:  31 grams
Fiber:  0 grams
This single-patty Steakburger provides 26 grams of protein and only 400 calories, so it’s filling without containing excessive calories.
Freddy’s also makes all its patties by hand at each location, and according to online reviews, many people are impressed by the taste and freshness of the restaurant’s burgers.

Overall healthiest cheeseburger: Five Guys Little Cheeseburger
The Little Cheeseburger from Five Guys is hardly “little” — it just has a single patty compared with the restaurant’s standard cheeseburger, which has two patties. It comes plain, unless you choose to add toppings, and provides ( 13 ):
Calories:  612
Fat:  32 grams
Protein:  27 grams
Carbs:  39 grams
Fiber:  2 grams
Five Guys is another burger joint that makes its own patties, so the meat may be fresher than that of other fast-food restaurants that purchase meat patties preprepared. The meat is also free of additives.
This generous portion also provides nearly 30 grams of protein. What’s more, opting for a lettuce bun will shave off 240 calories from the above calorie count and eliminate all the carbs.

Highest quality meat: BurgerFi Burger
The BurgerFi burger is made with two Angus beef patties, lettuce,  tomato , and BurgerFi sauce. It provides ( 14 ):
Calories:  655
Fat:  34 grams
Protein:  41 grams
Carbs:  44 grams
Fiber:  1 gram
You can find BurgerFi locations around the country, but they’re not as ubiquitous as some of the other restaurants on this list.
However, the restaurant uses  grass-fed beef  that’s finished with corn, which is higher quality (and more expensive) beef than most fast-food restaurants use.
At BurgerFi, you can also ask for any burger or sandwich “Green Style,” which subs in a lettuce bun for the standard hamburger bun.
As with the Five Guys lettuce bun option, this version likely reduces a substantial number of calories and carbs from the counts above.

Best plant-based burger: Burger King Impossible Whopper

Carbs:  58 grams
Fiber:  4 grams
Burger King is one of few fast-food restaurants that offers a dedicated vegetarian burger option, and many people — even meat eaters — report that it tastes great.
You can also make it fully vegan by requesting for Burger King to cook it off of the broiler and skip the mayo.

How to choose a healthy burger
Here are some ways to choose a healthier burger at any fast-food restaurant:
Many of the burgers on this list contain two patties. The extra patty nearly doubles the protein content of the burger without adding extra  refined carbs , making it a more filling meal ( 10 ).
However, if you’re counting calories, feel free to stick to a single patty.
To make almost any burger keto-friendly, just ask for a lettuce bun instead of a standard bun.
Many fast-food restaurants get these requests regularly and will package up your burger on a tray with a knife and fork. This is also a great option to reduce your calorie and refined-carb intake.
It’s a great low carb option, even if you’re not following a  keto diet .
If you’re counting calories, you can easily shave about 100–200 calories off of a burger by skipping the mayo and cheese.
Opt for other condiments and toppings to add flavor and texture, such as mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickle ( 25 ,  26 ).
That said, remember that even with these tweaks, fast food is still highly processed, high in  salt , and may be made with low quality ingredients.
While there are ways to make your fast-food burger healthier, regularly eating fast food isn’t part of a  healthy diet .

The bottom line
Fast-food burgers aren’t quite as terrible as people often make them out to be. The beef they contain is typically the most vilified ingredient, thanks to its cholesterol and saturated fat content. However, the beef patty actually provides the most nutrition.
Still, fast-food burgers shouldn’t be a regular part of your diet because they’re highly processed.
If you find yourself grabbing some fast food, look for burgers that are rich in protein. It’s easy to up the protein content by adding an extra patty.
To save calories, avoid cheese and mayo, and to cut the refined carbs, replace the burger bun with lettuce.
With a few simple changes, you can make nearly any burger a reasonably healthy fast-food option.
Not every food decision has to be based on maximizing your physical health.
It’s OK to enjoy food simply to enjoy it, even if that means you order a bacon cheeseburger with fries and a milkshake every once in a while.
As long as this is a rare indulgence, it won’t significantly affect your health. Just try not to make fast food a regular part of your diet.
