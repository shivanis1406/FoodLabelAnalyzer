How does the ProLon diet work?
The ProLon diet  is a prepackaged 5-day fast-mimicking diet. Your kit will arrive with vegetable-based soups, energy bars, snacks, herbal teas, and supplements along with directions on the appropriate times to eat them.
The ProLon diet is based on research led by Dr. Valter Longo at the University of Southern California. The foods included in the diet are designed to offer the nutrients necessary to support your body’s systems while being low enough in calories to avoid triggering the body’s cellular nutrition radars.
The ProLon diet is  designed for  healthy individuals wishing to optimize their well-being and individuals with overweight who are seeking to manage their weight.
The ProLon diet isn’t appropriate for those:
with an  eating disorder
with an infection
who don’t weigh enough or are malnourished
younger than 18 years or older than 70 years
who are  pregnant  or  breastfeeding
People with  diabetes ,  cancer ,  heart conditions , or a history of  fainting  should only try the ProLon diet under a doctor’s supervision.

What are the benefits of the ProLon diet?
For those who don’t want to spend time planning out their meals, the ProLon diet determines exactly what you should eat and saves you a trip to the grocery store.
In addition to simplifying meal planning, fasting can provide a variety of  health benefits . For example, it can:
support healthy aging
increase your metabolism
reduce inflammation
lower your  blood pressure
help you lose weight while maintaining lean muscle
encourage cellular rejuvenation
Additionally, ProLon is potentially eligible for purchase and reimbursement with your flexible spending or health savings account.

What are the disadvantages of the ProLon diet?
Due to the specific foods required, it can be hard for people with food allergies or strong food preferences to follow the ProLon diet. The ProLon diet may also not be a good fit for those on a tight budget due to the kit’s high cost.
A 5-day ProLon fasting kit costs approximately $175, or $35 per day. The research supporting the benefits and associated weight loss of the ProLon diet was specific to individuals following the 5-day program once a month for 3 months, which totals $525.
Fasting  isn’t appropriate  for everyone, and you may experience dizziness, fatigue, headaches, and difficulty concentrating while following the ProLon diet.
Also, you shouldn’t do the ProLon diet if you’ll be undertaking strenuous activities or spending time in extreme temperature environments, including saunas and hot tubs.
It’s important to remember that the ProLon diet isn’t a long-term, daily dietary solution for health complications.

Frequently asked questions about the ProLon diet
Here are answers to some frequently asked questions about the ProLon diet.
Most of the research into weight loss and the other benefits of fast-mimicking diets such as ProLon involve rodents or testing at the  cellular level .
A  2021 study  found that weight loss might occur during the fast-mimicking period, but it was not sustainable for the long term. More high-quality, long-term human studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of the ProLon diet for weight loss.
The ProLon meal plan lasts for 5 days with a day of transitional diet after. It’s important to discuss the best frequency for you with a licensed healthcare professional.
ProLon  generally recommends  doing it once a month for 3 months in a row the first time you do the diet. After that, depending on your health goals, you could do it once a month for up to 6 months or once every 3 months.
You may have fatigue, headaches, dizziness, or difficulty concentrating while doing the ProLon diet. Individuals with  allergies  to any of the ingredients included in the foods may experience hives, rashes, or difficulty breathing if they ingest these items.
Although ProLon recommends avoiding caffeine while following the diet, you can have  140 milligrams of caffeine  each day. According to ProLon, this is equivalent to about one 8–12-ounce cup of traditionally brewed black coffee, two cups of black or green caffeinated tea, or six cups of traditionally brewed decaffeinated coffee.

Takeaway
The ProLon fast-mimicking diet is a 5-day prepackaged plan that features vegetable-based soups, energy bars, snacks, herbal teas, and supplements.
The ProLon diet is designed to offer sufficient nutrients to sustain your body while keeping calories low enough so you’ll receive the benefits of being in a fasting state.
It’s important to remember that fast-mimicking diets aren’t appropriate for everyone. In addition, most of the research into the benefits of the ProLon diet involve rodents or testing at the cellular level. More high-quality, long-term human studies are needed.
