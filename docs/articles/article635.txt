Title: A 1,500-Calorie Diet: Food Lists, Meal Plan and More

A balanced 1,500-calorie diet rich in nutritious foods fits the needs of many people who want to lose fat and improve health. But this may not be enough nutrition for some.
When trying to lose weight, creating a calorie deficit either by eating less or increasing physical activity is necessary.
Many people choose to follow a 1,500-calorie diet plan to jumpstart weight loss and control their food intake.
This article explains how to follow a 1,500-calorie diet, including foods to eat, foods to avoid and tips for healthy, long-term weight loss.

Understanding calorie needs
While 1,500 calories may be a good guideline for many people, be sure to calculate your exact needs to optimize your weight loss journey
The number of calories you need depends on many factors, including physical activity, gender, age, weight loss goals and overall health( 1 ).
It’s important to estimate how many calories your body requires to both maintain and lose weight when determining your needs.
To calculate your overall calories needs, it’s necessary to calculate the total number of calories you typically burn in a day, which is known as your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) ( 2 ).
The easiest way to determine your TDEE is by using an  online calculator  or the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation, a formula in which you plug in your height, weight and age.
Here is the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation for both men and women:
Males:  Calories per day = 10x(weight in kg) + 6.25x(height in cm) – 5x(age) + 5
Females:  Calories per day = 10x(weight in kg) + 6.25x(height in cm) – 5x(age) – 161
To calculate your TDEE, the answer from the Mifflin. St. Jeor equation is then multiplied by a number corresponding to your level of activity, known as an activity factor ( 3 ).
There are five different levels of activity:
Sedentary:  x 1.2 (sedentary individuals who perform little to no exercise)
Lightly active:  x 1.375 (light exercise fewer than 3 days per week)
Moderately active:  x 1.55 (moderate exercise most days of the week)
Very active:  x 1.725 (hard exercise every day)
Extra active:  x 1.9 (strenuous exercise 2 or more times per day)
After determining your TDEE by multiplying the answer from the Mifflin. St-Jeor equation with the correct activity factor, calories can be adjusted depending on your weight loss goals.
While weight loss is much more complex than the “ calories in, calories out ” way of thinking, generally speaking, a calorie deficit needs to be created to lose body fat ( 4 ).
Typically, a reduction of 500 calories per day is suggested to lose 1 pound (450 grams) per week ( 5 ).
Though this would equate to a 52-pound (23.5-kg) weight loss in one year, research shows that the average rate of weight loss is much slower.
Behavioral and biological factors, such as dietary adherence and differences in  gut bacteria  and metabolic rates, lead people to lose weight at different rates ( 6 ,  7 ).
For example, a review of 35 studies observed weight loss of 0.004–2.5 pounds (0.002–1.13 kg) per week when calories were restricted by 240–1,000 calories per day ( 8 ).
Rather than setting an unrealistic goal, aim for slow, consistent weight loss of 1–2 pounds (0.5–1 kg) per week.
However, since weight loss differs drastically from person to person, it’s important to not get discouraged if you aren’t losing weight as quickly as expected.
Bumping up physical activity, spending less time sitting, reducing out added sugars and focusing on whole foods should help expedite weight loss and help you stay on track ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 )
Determine your calorie needs, then create a calorie deficit by subtracting 500 calories from your TDEE. Aim for a slow weight loss of 1–2 pounds (0.5–1 kg) per week.

Foods to eat on a 1,500-calorie diet
When attempting to lose weight and adopt better eating habits, it’s important to choose mostly minimally processed, whole foods.
Though it’s perfectly healthy to have a treat now and then, the majority of your diet should be made up of the following foods:
Non-starchy vegetables:  kale, arugula, spinach, broccoli, cauliflower, peppers, mushrooms, asparagus, tomatoes, etc.
Fruits:  berries, apples, pears, citrus fruits, melon, grapes, bananas, etc.
Starchy vegetables:  potatoes, peas, sweet potatoes, plantains, butternut squash, etc.
Fish and shellfish:  sea bass, salmon, cod, clams, shrimp, sardines, trout, oysters, etc.
Eggs:  whole  eggs  are more nutrient dense than egg whites
Poultry and meat:  chicken, turkey, beef, bison, lamb, etc.
Plant-based protein sources:  tofu, tempeh, plant-based protein powders
Whole grains:  oats, brown rice, farro, quinoa, bulgur, barley, millet, etc.
Legumes:  chickpeas, kidney beans, lentils, black beans and more
Healthy fats:  avocados, olive oil, unsweetened coconut, avocado oil, etc.
Dairy products:  plain yogurt, kefit, and cheese
Seeds, nuts and nut butters:  almonds, macadamia nuts, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, natural peanut butter, almond butter and tahini
Unsweetened plant-based milks:  coconut, almond, cashew and hemp milk
Seasonings:  turmeric, garlic, oregano, rosemary, chili pepper, black pepper, salt, etc.
Condiments:   Apple cider vinegar , salsa, lemon juice, garlic powder, etc.
Non-calorie beverages:  Water, sparkling water,  coffee , green tea, etc.
Be sure to eat plenty of fiber-rich foods and quality sources of protein at each meal.
Protein is the most filling of the three macronutrients and combining a protein with filling fiber sources, such as non-starchy vegetables, beans or berries, can help prevent overeating.
Research shows that both high-fiber and  high-protein diets  are effective at promoting fat loss ( 12 ,  13 ).
Whole foods, such as vegetables, fruits, eggs, fish and nuts, should make up the majority of any healthy diet.

Foods to avoid
Highly processed foods and added sugar should be kept to a minimum in any healthy weight loss plan.
Limiting the following foods can help you lose weight and improve your overall health.
Fast food:  chicken nuggets, fries, pizza, hot dogs etc.
Refined carbs:  white bread, sugary cereals, white pasta, bagels, crackers, corn chips, etc.
Added sugars:  sugary snack bars, candy, baked goods, candy, table sugar, agave, etc.
Fried foods:  potato chips,  deep-fried foods , doughnuts, mozzarella sticks, etc.
Diet and low-fat foods:  diet bars, low-fat ice cream, low-fat chips, diet frozen meals, low-calorie candies, etc.
Sweetened beverages:  soda, fruit juice, energy drinks, flavored milks, sweetened coffee drinks, etc.
Although enjoying a favorite food or beverage every now and then won’t hurt your weight loss goals, indulging regularly might.
For example, if you have a habit of eating ice cream every night after dinner, consider reducing your intake to one serving of ice cream once or twice a week.
Cutting back on habits that are hindering weight loss may take time, but it’s necessary in order to reach your wellness goals.
Fast food, refined carbs and added sugars should be limited when following a nutritious diet for weight loss.

As you can see, eating healthy doesn’t have to be boring.
What’s more, though cooking and packing meals from home should be prioritized, there are plenty of healthy choices for on-the-go meals.
If you know you will be eating at a restaurant, look at the menu beforehand and pick out an option that is both appetizing and nutritious.
This way, you will be less inclined to make a last-minute unhealthy meal choice.
A 1,500-calorie diet should be rich in fresh produce, protein and fiber. Though preparing meals at home is best, it’s possible to make healthy choices when eating out by reviewing the menu beforehand.

Tips for successful weight loss
While sticking to a 1,500-calorie diet may certainly spark weight loss, there are several other ways to ensure that you meet your  weight loss goals  in a healthy, sustainable way.
Though you may think that you’re eating less, it’s common to underestimate the amount of food that you are consuming ( 15 ).
An easy way to make sure you are staying under your calorie needs is to use a food journal or  calorie tracking app .
Logging meals, snacks and drinks along with the calories they contain can help you stay on track and reduces the chances of underestimating your calorie consumption.
Although tracking foods is a helpful tool when first starting a meal plan, it can create an unhealthy relationship with food in some people ( 16 ,  17 ).
Focusing on  portion control , eating whole foods, practicing mindful eating and getting enough exercise are better ways to keep weight off in the long term ( 18 ,  19 ,  20 ,  21 ).
Any  healthy meal plan  should revolve around whole, minimally processed foods.
Eating too much highly processed food and beverages, such as fast food, candy, and soda can increase your chance of developing chronic diseases and obesity ( 22 ).
Although processed diet and low-fat snacks and meals may seem like a wise choice when trying to lose weight, these foods often contain ingredients like added sugars that can contribute to inflammation and weight gain ( 23 ).
Whole foods like vegetables, fruits, fish, eggs, poultry, nuts and seeds are packed with nutrients and tend to be more filling than processed foods ( 24 ).
Basing your meals around whole foods is one of the best ways to promote lasting weight loss or to maintain a healthy body weight.
Even though it’s possible to lose weight by just cutting calories, adding  exercise  into your routine not only promotes weight loss but improves overall health.
While starting a new fitness program may seem like a daunting task, it doesn’t have to be.
If you have never exercised, simply going on half-hour  walks  three times a week is an excellent way to boost activity.
Once you’re in better physical shape, add in different types of workouts or activities like  biking ,  swimming ,  hiking  or  jogging .
Increasing exercise can boost your mood and decrease your risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers ( 25 ).
While people generally state that they want to lose weight, they often mean that they want to lose fat.
When you adopt a healthy, sustainable weight loss plan that includes plenty of exercise, you should be  gaining muscle mass .
Though this leads to slower weight loss, increased muscle mass helps your body burn fat ( 26 ).
Rely less on the scale and try out different methods to track fat loss, such as taking measurements of your thighs, hips, belly, chest and upper arms.
This can show you that even though the scale shows slow weight loss, you’re still losing fat and gaining muscle.
Being aware of calorie intake, eating whole foods, increasing physical activity and not obsessing over your body weight are simple ways to reach your weight loss goals.

The bottom line
No matter how much weight you need to lose, cutting out excess calories and increasing physical activity is key.
A 1,500-calorie diet fits the needs of many people who want to lose fat and improve health. Like any healthy diet it should include mostly whole, unprocessed foods.
Reducing excess calories and using some of the simple tips in this article can help you succeed in your  weight loss  journey.
