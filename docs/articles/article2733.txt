Title: 10 Ways to Boost Human Growth Hormone (HGH) Naturally

Diet changes, such as reducing sugar, exercising regularly, and certain supplements may help naturally increase levels of human growth hormone.
Human growth hormone (HGH) is an important hormone produced by your pituitary gland.
Also known as growth hormone (GH), it plays a key role in regulating growth in children. HGH also supports metabolism and improves muscle growth, strength, and lean body mass ( 1 ,  2 ).
Low HGH levels may decrease your quality of life, increase your risk of disease, and lead to body fat gain ( 3 ).
However, note that it is not recommended to treat age-related changes in body composition or physical performance with  growth hormone , as it may increase the risk of neoplastic diseases, such as cancer ( 2 ).
If you suspect you may have low levels of growth hormone, a doctor can diagnose growth hormone deficiency using several tests, including the insulin tolerance test, GHRH-arginine stimulation test, or glucagon stimulation test ( 4 ).
Though  growth hormone deficiency  — a condition often caused by genetic disorders and other health conditions — requires treatment from a doctor, making changes to your diet and lifestyle choices as directed by a healthcare professional may be beneficial for maintaining HGH within a normal range ( 5 ,  6 ).
Here are 10 evidence-based ways to increase human growth hormone (HGH) levels naturally.

1. Lose body fat
The amount of  belly fat  you carry is directly related to your HGH production ( 7 ).
Those with higher levels of belly fat may have impaired HGH production and an increased risk of disease.
In fact, one older study found that having higher amounts of belly fat was linked to lower levels of HGH ( 8 ).
Another 2005 study monitored the 24-hour release of HGH and found a large decline in those with more abdominal fat ( 9 ).
Excess belly fat is also linked to many chronic conditions. Therefore,  losing belly fat  may help optimize HGH levels and other aspects of health ( 10 ,  11 ).
Reducing excess body fat — especially around your belly — may help optimize HGH levels and improve overall health.

2. Fast intermittently
Studies show that  fasting  leads to a major increase in HGH levels.
Interestingly, one recent study in 47 people found that HGH levels increased five-fold during a 24-hour fast ( 12 ).
Other older studies have also demonstrated increased HGH secretion after 2 or 5 day fasts ( 13 ,  14 ).
However, continuous fasting is not sustainable in the long term.  Intermittent fasting  is a more popular dietary approach that limits eating to brief time periods.
Multiple methods  of intermittent fasting are available. One common approach is a daily 8-hour eating window with a 16-hour fast. Another involves limiting daily calorie intake for 2 days per week ( 15 ).
Intermittent fasting can alter HGH levels in two main ways. First, it can help decrease body fat, which directly affects HGH production ( 16 ,  17 ).
Second, it’ll keep your  insulin levels  low for most of the day, as insulin is released when you eat. Research suggests that insulin spikes can disrupt your growth hormone signaling ( 18 ).
Though shorter 12–16-hour fasts might also be beneficial, there is limited research available, as most studies are focused on the effects of full-day fasts.
Fasting may increase HGH levels, though more research is needed on shorter, 12–16-hour fasts.

3. Consider an arginine supplement
When taken alone,  arginine  may boost HGH ( 19 ).
Though some people tend to use amino acids like arginine alongside exercise, several older studies show that exercise may blunt or reduce the response of growth hormone ( 19 ,  20 ).
However, one older study observed that taking arginine and  lysine  — without any exercise —significantly increased levels of this hormone ( 21 ).
According to one test-tube study,  L-arginine  could activate a pathway in the body responsible for the synthesis and secretion of HGH ( 22 ).
Another study in 30 active males found that taking 10 grams (g) of arginine after an overnight fast led to a modest increase in HGH levels ( 23 ).
However, it’s important to talk to a doctor before adding arginine to your routine, especially if you are taking other medications or have any underlying health conditions. Additionally, note that long-term supplementation with arginine has been linked to adverse effects on health, especially for older adults ( 24 ).
Some studies have found that arginine supplements may influence growth hormone production. However, more research is needed.

4. Reduce your sugar intake
An increase in insulin may alter the expression of neurons that release HGH ( 25 ).
According to one older study in people with obesity, high insulin levels can reduce levels of growth hormone. Because  refined carbs  and sugar raise insulin levels the most, reducing your intake may help optimize growth hormone levels ( 18 ,  26 ).
Along with directly affecting insulin levels,  excess sugar  intake is a key factor in weight gain and obesity, which also affect HGH levels ( 27 ,  28 ).
Aim to achieve a balanced diet, as what you eat has a profound effect on your health, hormones, and body composition.
Consuming large amounts of refined carbs and sugar can increase insulin levels, which can alter HGH production. Therefore, aim to eat a balanced diet and limit your intake of refined carbs and added sugar.

5. Consider taking a GABA supplement
Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)  is an amino acid found in the brain, spinal cord, and elsewhere in the body, where it functions as a neurotransmitter and sends signals around your brain ( 29 ).
As a well-known calming agent for your brain and central nervous system, there is limited research showing that it could also ease stress and promote sleep ( 30 ).
Interestingly, it may also help increase your HGH levels. In fact, one 2008 study found that taking a GABA supplement led to a 400% increase in HGH at rest and a 200% increase following exercise ( 31 ).
Limited research suggests that GABA may also help improve sleep. This could potentially increase HGH levels, as nighttime growth hormone release is linked to  sleep quality  ( 2 ,  30 ,  32 ).
However, more research is needed on the long-term effects of GABA on growth hormone levels.
Additionally, it’s important to consult with a healthcare professional before taking GABA to minimize adverse side effects and prevent interactions with other medications ( 33 ).
One study found that GABA supplements could increase HGH production. Limited research also suggests that it could improve sleep quality, which could potentially increase HGH levels. However, more research is needed.

6. Try aerobic exercise
Exercise can increase HGH levels. The extent of this increase depends on the type and intensity of exercise, along with your cardiorespiratory fitness level ( 34 ).
In particular,  high intensity exercise  has been shown to increase levels of HGH in several studies. However, other forms, such as moderate intensity exercise, may also be beneficial ( 35 ,  36 ,  37 ).
More research is needed to determine whether regular exercise can increase daily HGH levels ( 36 ).
Nevertheless, over the long-term,  exercise  may optimize your hormone function and decrease body fat, both of which will benefit your HGH levels.
Some studies have found that high intensity exercise can increase HGH levels. However, other types of exercise, including moderate intensity exercise, can also be beneficial.

7. Consider taking a sports drink around your workouts
Some  sports supplements  can enhance performance and temporarily boost your HGH levels ( 38 ,  39 ).
One older study demonstrated that a pre-workout sports drink significantly increased growth hormone levels immediately after exercising and up to 15 minutes post-workout ( 38 ).
Though more recent research is needed, another study found that consuming a carb-containing  protein shake  could boost HGH levels around workouts ( 39 ).
However, if a casein or whey protein supplement is taken immediately before strength exercise, it may have the opposite effect ( 40 ).
In fact, one 2005 study found that drinking a beverage containing 25 g of casein or whey protein 30 minutes before strength exercise reduced levels of human growth hormone and  testosterone , compared with a non-caloric placebo ( 40 ).
Be sure to consult with a healthcare professional before taking sports drinks or other supplements and use only as directed.
While more research is needed, some studies have found that sports drinks or protein-carbohydrate supplements could increase short-term growth hormone spikes during or after a workout.

8. Optimize your sleep
HGH is released in pulses when you sleep. These pulses are based on your body’s internal clock or circadian rhythm ( 41 ).
Studies have shown that inadequate  sleep  can reduce the amount of HGH your body produces ( 42 ).
For this reason, getting an adequate amount of deep sleep is one of the best strategies to enhance your long-term HGH production.
Here are a few simple strategies to help optimize your sleep ( 43 ):
Avoid  blue light exposure  before bedtime.
Read a book in the evening.
Make sure your bedroom is at a comfortable temperature.
Don’t consume  caffeine  late in the day.
Focus on optimizing sleep quality to support HGH production. Most adults should also aim for at least 7 hours of quality sleep per night.

9. Consider a melatonin supplement
Melatonin is a hormone that plays an important role in sleep and blood pressure regulation ( 44 ).
Melatonin supplements  have become a popular supplement that can increase the quality and duration of your sleep ( 45 ,  46 ).
Some older research has shown that a melatonin supplement can enhance HGH production. However, more research is needed to determine whether melatonin provides any additional benefit beyond that provided by sleep. Additionally, one study found no significant effect of melatonin on HGH levels ( 47 ,  48 ,  49 ).
Melatonin is fairly safe for short-term use and non-toxic. Still, it can cause some  side effects  and may interact with certain medications. Additionally, there is limited information on its long-term safety, so it’s important to check with a healthcare professional before taking it ( 50 ,  51 ,  52 ).
Melatonin supplements can enhance sleep, which may increase your body’s natural HGH production.

10. Consider other natural supplements
Several other supplements may enhance human growth hormone production, including:
Glutamine:  One older study found that a 2-g dose of  glutamine  could temporarily increase HGH levels by up to 78% ( 53 ).
Creatine:  According to one study in sprinters and long-distance runners,  creatine  supplementation significantly increased HGH levels after 6 weeks ( 54 ).
Ornithine :  One 2010 study gave participants ornithine 30 minutes after exercise and found a greater peak  in HGH levels ( 55 ).
More recent, high quality research is needed to understand the effectiveness of these supplements.
Furthermore, while these supplements may increase your HGH levels, studies indicate that their effects are only temporary.
Keep in mind that it’s best to talk to a doctor or other healthcare professional before adding any natural supplements to your routine.
Several natural supplements may increase the production of HGH. However, more high quality research is needed to understand whether these supplements cause a long-term increase in HGH or are more effective than other approaches, such as exercise or sleep.

The bottom line
As with other key hormones, such as testosterone and estrogen, having healthy levels of growth hormone is important.
HGH helps your body with  metabolism  and other vital functions.
Exercising regularly, getting plenty of sleep, following a nutritious diet, and maintaining a moderate body weight may be beneficial for maintaining HGH levels and promoting overall health.
Certain supplements may also be beneficial, but should only be taken as directed by a healthcare professional.
