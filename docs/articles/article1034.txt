Title: Does Cinnamon Trigger Acid Reflux? All You Need to Know

There’s no concrete evidence that cinnamon helps reduce or worsen acid reflux. Some studies suggest it may be helpful with related conditions like heartburn or indigestion, but more research is needed to verify this.
If you’ve ever felt a burning sensation in your chest during or after eating, you’ve likely experienced acid reflux. This uncomfortable, frustrating condition is caused by stomach acid moving up into your esophagus.
Diet, stress, body weight, smoking, pregnancy, and other lifestyle factors may trigger it. In particular, the foods and spices you eat may cause acid reflux or worsen its symptoms.
In addition, acid reflux can be a symptom of  gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) , which affects over  25%  of the North American population.
Cinnamon is one of the world’s most popular spices and is widely debated as a cure or cause of acid reflux. As such, you may wonder whether to eat it if you have this condition.
This article explains whether cinnamon causes or treats acid reflux.

What is cinnamon?
Cinnamon is a popular spice used in many cultural dishes around the world. It’s commonly used in desserts, breakfast dishes, and warm beverages.
It’s also beneficial for your health thanks to its polyphenol plant compounds, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In particular, it’s  high  in cinnamic acid, cinnamaldehyde, and various  flavonoids .
The most widely available type is  cassia cinnamon , which is usually more processed and contains fewer antioxidants. On the other hand,  Ceylon cinnamon  is considered “true” cinnamon. It contains more antioxidants but is hard to find in most stores.

Does cinnamon cause or cure acid reflux?
To date, no research suggests that cinnamon causes or exacerbates acid reflux.
However, A  2021 study  did find that cinnamon may help with  functional dyspepsia  or indigestion.
One  2020 Iranian study  that looked at the spices pepper, curry,  ginger ,  turmeric , and cinnamon found that those people who ate spicy foods containing these spices experienced more  heartburn, which is caused by acid reflux.  That said, given that the study was not conducted in the United States, it’s possible population differences had an affect on the results.
That said, it’s not common for people to consume cinnamon by itself. It’s usually used in small quantities and often served with other triggering foods, which makes it difficult to tie it directly to worsened symptoms. More research is needed to understand whether cinnamon itself can either trigger or cure acid reflux.
There’s no direct evidence to suggest that cinnamon cures acid reflux. Therefore, it’s best to work with your healthcare professional to find  more effective treatments .
However, triggers of acid reflux are  highly individual , and what affects one person may not affect another. Therefore, it’s important to pay attention to your own eating habits to determine whether cinnamon or other foods trigger your symptoms.
If you think that cinnamon may be worsening your symptoms, try eliminating it from your diet for 3–4 weeks. If your symptoms improve, you may want to limit or completely avoid this spice. If your symptoms don’t improve, you can reintroduce it to your diet.
Until more research is available, it’s best to  listen to your body  and only eliminate foods that worsen your acid reflux symptoms.
If you’re not sure where to start, consult a doctor or registered dietitian to help determine the best course of action.

Tips to managing acid reflux
Learning to manage acid reflux is important for your comfort and health. Untreated, ongoing acid reflux  can lead  to serious conditions like  Barrett’s esophagus ,  esophageal cancer ,  difficulty swallowing , and chronic pain.
