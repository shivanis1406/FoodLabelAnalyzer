Title: 8 Easy Ways to Lose Water Weight (Fast and Safely)

Water weight, also called edema, is when you have a build-up of fluid in your body. Some ways that may help you lose water weight include making dietary changes, exercising, and taking supplements.
The human body contains around  60%  water, which plays a key role in all aspects of life.
You may experience weight fluctuations from one day to another. This is most likely due to water retention, which may happen for various reasons like eating foods high in salt. This type of water weight is usually temporary and harmless.
That said, persistent water weight or symptoms like swollen ankles, feet, and legs may signal a chronic medical condition called  edema .
Keep reading to learn more about 8 ways to reduce water weight safely, its causes, and when to see a doctor.

1. Exercise on a regular basis
Exercise  may help reduce water weight in the short term because it increases sweat, which means you lose water.
It’s also not uncommon to lose a  small amount of body weight  from sweating during exercise, depending on factors such as heat and clothing.
During exercise, your body also shifts a lot of water into your muscles.
This can help reduce water  outside of the cell  and decrease the “soft” look people report from  excessive water retention . That said, you still need to drink plenty of water during your training session.
The  sauna  may also help increase sweat and water loss, which you could add in after your gym session.

2. Increase potassium consumption
Potassium  is an important electrolyte involved in regulating  fluid balance . It helps counteract the effects of sodium by increasing excretion and urine production. This could help prevent water retention and fluid build-up.
Eating more  potassium-rich foods  may be beneficial for reducing excess water weight. These may  include :
potatoes
apricots
spinach
tomatoes
lentils
poultry
seafood
dairy products

3. Manage salt intake
Sodium  is one of the most common electrolytes in the human body and is obtained daily from salt.
It plays a major role in hydration levels. If sodium levels are too low or too high, it will lead to imbalances within the body.
Consuming high levels of  salt  may  increase fluid retention , which could add water weight. However, this seems to depend on several factors, such as:
your current daily sodium intake
your sodium blood levels
underlying health conditions, such as  heart failure  or  chronic kidney disease
The authors of a  2017 study  also suggest that a sudden increase in sodium consumption may lead to increased thirst and fluid intake. This could result in fluid retention.

4. Take a magnesium supplement
Magnesium  is another key electrolyte and mineral that has over  300 roles  in the human body, including managing hydration and fluid retention levels.
Studies suggest that magnesium can  ease symptoms  of  premenstrual syndrome (PMS)  like water retention.
These changes occur because magnesium plays an integrative role with other  electrolytes , such as sodium and potassium. Together, they help control your body’s water balance.
In addition to magnesium supplements,  magnesium-rich foods  are also recommended. These include dark green leafy vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains.

5. Take a dandelion supplement
Dandelion, also known as Taraxacum officinale, is a herb used in alternative medicine to help  treat water retention . For example,  some bodybuilders  use it to lose water weight for aesthetic purposes or to meet a weight category.
Dandelion supplements  may help you lose water weight by signaling the kidneys to expel more urine and additional salt or sodium. A  2009 study  shows that taking dandelion supplements may increase the frequency of urination over a 5-hour period.
That said, more research is required on the effectiveness of dandelion supplements on water retention and weight.

6. Consider certain foods and herbs
Some foods and herbs may help you lose water weight and combat water retention, including:
corn silk
horsetail
parsley
hibiscus
fennel
nettle
It’s important to note that research on the  diuretic  properties of these herbal ingredients is mostly limited to test-tube and animal studies. Larger human studies are needed to better understand the diuretic benefits of these herbs.
Additionally, though bloating is usually not caused by water retention, you may also wish to limit or temporarily remove  foods that may cause bloating .

7. Cut carbs
Cutting  carbs  is a common strategy to quickly drop excess water weight. Carbs are stored in the muscles and liver as glycogen. However, glycogen pulls water inside along with it.
Around  3–4 grams  (0.11–0.14 ounces) of water may be stored for every gram of glycogen. This may be why people experience immediate weight loss when switching to a  low carb diet , which reduces glycogen stores.
Carbs may also spike  insulin levels . This could  increase  sodium retention and reabsorption of water in the kidneys. Low carb diets lead to a drop in insulin levels, which could lead to a loss of sodium and water from the kidneys.
Try altering your  carb intake  and see what works best for you.

8. Take caffeine supplements or drink tea and coffee
Caffeine and beverages that contain caffeine like  coffee  and tea may help you lose water weight.
Caffeine may have a diuretic effect and increase  short-term urine output . This could increase the amount of water that leaves your body, therefore decreasing water weight.
However, this varies depending on the amount of  caffeine  that you consume.
For instance, a  2017 study  found that drinking about 537 milligrams (mg) of caffeine, or approximately 6 cups of coffee, significantly increased urine production. On the other hand, drinking 269 mg of caffeine, or around 3 cups of coffee, had no effect on fluid balance.

Causes of water weight
Water weight may have several different causes,  such as :
eating a diet that’s  high in salt
being inactive or  sitting for too long
hormonal changes, such as during  pregnancy  and  menstruation
some treatments, such as  chemotherapy  and  hormonal replacement therapy
medications, such as some  antidepressants ,  blood pressure medication , and  contraception
chronic conditions, such as  heart disease ,  kidney disease , or  liver disease
It’s important to speak with a healthcare professional if your water weight doesn’t go away after a few days. It may be a sign of an underlying health condition that needs medical treatment.

Frequently asked questions
You could check for water weight at home by using a method that doctors use to assess for  pitting edema .
Apply pressure to the swollen area. If this leaves an indentation, it’s usually water weight. If the area simply bounces back, it’s usually true weight. This method may not work for relatively healthy people trying to figure out if the fast food they ate last night increased true weight or water weight.
Other signs of water weight may  include :
rapid weight gain
gaining more than 4 pounds (lbs) in 3 days
swollen extremities, such as feet, ankles, hands, and wrists
It’s best to speak with a healthcare professional if you’re unsure about water weight.
It’s possible to experience up to  10%  of your body weight before detecting pitting edema. This means that water weight can be 10 pounds or higher.
Short-term fluid retention may go away on its own or after exercising, returning to a well-balanced diet, or until your hormones are rebalanced. If you have edema, you may experience swollen ankles, feet, or legs for a longer period of time.

When to see a doctor
Speak with a healthcare professional if your water retention problems persist, are severe, or increase suddenly.
In some cases, excess water retention can be caused by a serious medical condition.

Takeaway
The best way to combat excess water weight is to identify and treat the cause. This may include excess salt intake, inactivity, or the regular consumption of  processed foods .
Water weight is common. It will typically go away on its own or with at-home interventions, such as exercise.
That said, water weight that doesn’t go away may be a sign of edema, which could require medical treatment. Speak with a healthcare professional if your water weight doesn’t get better after a few days of treatment.
