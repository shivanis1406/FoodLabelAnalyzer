Title: Does Drinking Okra Water in the Morning Have Benefits?

Okra water is a drink made by soaking okra pods in water for up to 24 hours.
Its proponents claim that it boosts weight loss and improves blood sugar management, among other health benefits. It’s also considered a convenient alternative to eating okra, especially for those who don’t enjoy okra’s unique texture and taste.
This article examines the potential benefits and downsides of drinking okra water.

Does okra water contain nutrients?
The specific nutritional value of okra water is unknown, but okra itself is a good source of several key vitamins and minerals.
Eight pods of raw okra contain ( 1 ):
Calories:  31
Protein:  2 grams
Fat:  0.2 grams
Carbs:  7 grams
Fiber:  3 grams
Manganese:  33% of the Daily Value (DV)
Vitamin C:  24% of the DV
Thiamin:  16% of the DV
Folate:  14% of the DV
Magnesium:  13% of the DV
Vitamin B6:  12% of the DV
Copper:  12% of the DV
Okra is especially rich in  manganese , a mineral involved in metabolism and blood sugar regulation. It’s also high in vitamin C, which acts as an antioxidant and plays a central role in immune function ( 2 ,  3 ).
Keep in mind that it’s unclear which of these  micronutrients  is found in okra water, as well as the specific amounts that okra water contains. Therefore, more studies are needed.
Although more research is necessary to determine the nutritional value of okra water, okra itself is a great source of manganese and vitamin C.

Potential health benefits of okra water
While no specific research exists on okra water, it may be linked to several health benefits due to its plant compounds and hydrating effects.
Test-tube studies show that okra is a great source of several important antioxidants, such as quercetin and kaempferol, which may also be found in okra water. These compounds may  reduce inflammation  and neutralize harmful compounds called free radicals ( 4 ,  5 ).
What’s more,  antioxidants  may protect against several chronic health conditions, including diabetes, cancer, and heart disease ( 6 ).
Several okra compounds may  promote weight loss .
In a study in mice fed a high fat diet, carbs extracted from okra decreased body weight, blood sugar levels, and total cholesterol ( 7 ).
In another study, mice with diabetes given okra extract experienced significant reductions in body weight after 8 weeks ( 8 ).
All the same, human studies on okra water are lacking.
Still, okra water may help you stay hydrated. Drinking more water may increase weight loss, reduce food intake, and temporarily  boost your metabolism  ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ).
Some studies suggest that okra water may help  stabilize blood sugar levels .
According to one review, okra contains several compounds — including polyphenols and flavonoids — that may help reduce blood sugar levels ( 12 ).
Plus, an 8-week study in 60 people with type 2 diabetes found that taking okra powder improved  insulin resistance , which may support better blood sugar management ( 13 ).
One test-tube study also found that okra extract may alter the expression of certain enzymes and proteins to help prevent diabetes-related nephropathy, a kidney-related diabetes complication ( 14 ).
Nevertheless, these studies didn’t examine the effect of okra water specifically, and more long-term human studies are needed.
Okra water is a good source of several antioxidants and may promote weight loss and blood sugar management. Still, more human research is necessary.

Does okra water have any downsides?
Okra water is generally considered safe. However, it may cause adverse reactions in people who are  allergic  to okra.
Okra is also high in fructans, a carb that may cause  digestive issues  in some people when consumed in large amounts ( 15 ).
Although it’s unclear whether okra water itself contains large amounts of fructans, you should stop drinking it and talk with a healthcare professional if you experience any side effects.
Okra water is unsuitable for those allergic to okra and may cause digestive issues for some people. Still, it’s perfectly safe for most people.

When to drink okra water
Okra water is typically made by soaking okra pods or thin slices of okra in water overnight, or for up to 24 hours. Once the okra has soaked, squeeze any leftover sap from the pods and combine it with the infused water.
It’s common to drink okra water  first thing in the morning  on an empty stomach. Proponents claim that this maximizes its potential health benefits.
However, no research supports the claim that okra water is more beneficial in the morning than at other times of the day. Therefore, you can enjoy okra water whenever works best for you.
For best results, pair okra water with a well-rounded diet rich in  nutrient-dense foods  like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.
Although proponents often claim that you should drink okra water first thing in the morning, you can enjoy it any time of day.

The bottom line
Okra water is made by infusing okra pods in water for 8–24 hours.
While there’s very little research on this drink,  okra  itself is highly nutritious and rich in antioxidants. Okra water may also offer several other health benefits, including promoting weight loss and blood sugar management.
Be sure to enjoy okra water as part of a nutritious, balanced diet to maximize its potential benefits.
