Title: Lipozene Review: Does It Work and Is It Safe? 

Diet pills  may seem like an attractive option for people who find weight loss difficult.
They offer a seemingly easy way to get rid of excess weight. Many also promise to help burn fat without strict diets or exercise regimens.
Lipozene is a weight loss supplement that claims to do just that with exceptional results. However, study results on Lipozene’s active ingredient are mixed.
The brand also failed Healthline’s vetting process because of noncompliance with labeling regulations and concerns about the product’s safety.
This article reviews the effectiveness of Lipozene and whether it’s safe to use.

What is Lipozene?
Lipozene is an over-the-counter weight loss supplement that contains a water-soluble fiber called  glucomannan .
In fact, glucomannan is the only active ingredient in Lipozene. It comes from the roots of the konjac plant, which is also called elephant yam.
The glucomannan fiber has an extraordinary ability to absorb water — a single capsule can turn an entire glass of water into a gel.
For this reason, it’s often used as an additive to thicken or emulsify food. It’s also the main ingredient in  shirataki noodles .
As a result of this water-absorbing property, glucomannan can have certain health benefits, such as constipation relief and reductions in cholesterol and  blood sugar levels , and may contribute to weight loss ( 1 ).
Lipozene is a commercial glucomannan product that claims to offer all these benefits without requiring a prescription.
It also contains gelatin, magnesium silicate, and stearic acid. None of these help with weight loss — instead, they add bulk and keep the product from getting lumpy.
The manufacturers of Lipozene also offer another product, MetaboUP Plus, which claims to help increase metabolism and energy levels. However, there is no research available on the effectiveness or safety of this supplement.

How does Lipozene aid weight loss?
Observational studies suggest that people who eat more  dietary fiber  tend to weigh less.
Soluble fiber could help you lose weight in a number of ways, including by improving appetite regulation and increasing feelings of fullness ( 2 ,  3 ).
Here are some ways glucomannan, the active ingredient in Lipozene, may promote weight loss:
Keeps you full:  It absorbs water and expands in your stomach. This slows the rate at which food leaves your stomach, making you feel full longer ( 4 ).
Reduces calorie intake:  It may reduce the absorption of other nutrients, such as protein and fat, so you get fewer calories from the food you eat ( 5 ,  6 ).
Promotes gut health:  It may indirectly influence weight  by promoting good bacteria  in your gut. Though more research is needed, this could potentially support weight management ( 6 ).
Many other types of soluble fiber may offer the same effects.
However, glucomannan’s super-absorbent properties cause it to form an extra-thick gel, perhaps making it even more effective at making you feel full ( 7 ).

Does it really work?
A number of studies have investigated how glucomannan, Lipozene’s active ingredient, affects weight loss. Many report small but positive effects ( 1 ,  8 ).
One review of six studies found that glucomannan supplementation was effective at reducing body weight in people with overweight or obesity ( 9 ).
The review authors noted that glucomannan may be especially beneficial for women and adults who took it for at least 8 weeks ( 9 ).
Similarly, a 2015 review concluded that glucomannan may help reduce body weight in people with overweight or obesity in the short term ( 10 ).
However, keep in mind that there is limited research on the long-term effects of glucomannan.
Additionally, several older studies have found that glucomannan has no significant effect on weight loss ( 11 ,  12 ,  13 ).
For long lasting, sustainable weight loss, it’s important to make  changes to your diet  and lifestyle.

Other potential health benefits
Soluble fiber  is linked to various health benefits.
Therefore, taking Lipozene may have other benefits besides weight loss.
The potential health benefits include:
Reduced constipation:  Glucomannan can increase regularity and may help treat constipation in certain populations ( 14 ,  15 ).
Lower disease risk:  It may lower cholesterol and blood sugar levels, which is important because high levels are risk factors for heart disease and type 2 diabetes ( 1 ,  16 ,  17 ).
Improved gut health:  Glucomannan has prebiotic properties. It feeds the friendly bacteria in your gut, which produce beneficial  short-chain fatty acids  that may lower your risk of several diseases ( 18 ,  19 ).

Lipozene dosage
The manufacturers recommend that you take 2 capsules of Lipozene 30 minutes before a meal, along with at least 8 ounces (237 mL) of water.
You can do this three times per day, for a maximum of six capsules spread throughout the day.
This is equal to taking 1.5 grams three times per day, or 4.5 grams total per day. That just exceeds the amount that some older studies have suggested may be effective for weight loss: 2–4 grams per day ( 20 ).
However, according to the European Food Safety Authority, the timing is quite important, as glucomannan is unlikely to affect weight unless it’s taken before a meal ( 21 ).
Keep in mind that the benefits of Lipozene and glucomannan are the same. This means you could buy an unbranded, cheaper glucomannan supplement if you wanted to.
Also, konjac flour, which contains glucomannan, is the main ingredient in shirataki noodles, which cost even less.
It’s important to take Lipozene in capsule form — rather than directly consuming the powder from inside the capsules — and to wash it down with plenty of water.
This is because glucomannan powder is very absorbent. If taken incorrectly, it could expand before it reaches your stomach and cause a blockage. Inhaling the powder could also be life threatening ( 22 ).
Additionally, you may want to start with a small amount and increase it gradually. Suddenly including a lot of fiber in your diet can cause digestive distress ( 23 ).
Lipozene is usually well tolerated. However, according to online reviews, potential side effects include:
nausea
stomach discomfort
diarrhea
constipation
If you’re taking any medications, especially diabetes medications such as sulfonylureas, consult a doctor before taking Lipozene, as some older research suggests that glucomannan may reduce the medication’s effectiveness by slowing its absorption ( 24 ).
Nevertheless, you can likely avoid this by taking your medication at least an hour before or 4 hours after taking the supplement.

Brand reputation
Lipozene has a “D” rating from the Better Business Bureau, and numerous customers have filed complaints about issues with the company’s billing and delivery processes.
The brand and product also failed  Healthline’s vigorous vetting process  because the company does not consistently use the disclaimers that the Food and Drug Administration requires when making claims about the health benefits of an ingredient or product.
Additionally, the company does not provide a supplement facts label or the dosage of all active ingredients for its MetaboUP Plus product.
It also failed because of potential safety risks associated with glucomannan’s expansion, which has the potential to cause an obstruction in the esophagus or bowel.
While some people who have left reviews claim that the product has helped them lose weight by curbing their appetite, others feel that the product isn’t worth the cost.

When to see a doctor
Though diet supplements like Lipozene may seem appealing, they should not be considered a replacement for a well-rounded diet and healthy lifestyle to support long-term, sustainable weight loss.
Furthermore, Lipozene may not be suitable for everyone. If you’re taking any medications or have any underlying health conditions, be sure to talk with your doctor before using Lipozene or other weight loss supplements.
You should discuss any concerns or adverse side effects that you experience with your doctor and should use supplements only as directed.
Working with a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian (RD), to develop a personalized plan may also be beneficial to help you reach your weight loss goals.

Alternative weight loss solutions
Whether you’re having difficulty managing portion sizes, finding time to exercise, or changing other health-related behaviors, there are many programs and services that can support your weight loss efforts.
Here are a few options to consider:
Make an appointment with an RD:  For a truly personalized approach to weight loss, you can  search for an RD  in your area or find one who offers online coaching.
Download a meal planning app:   PlateJoy  is a meal planning app designed by RDs. Using the results of a detailed questionnaire, the app curates weekly menus and shopping lists to help you reach your health goals.
Try a prepared meal delivery service:  If you dislike cooking or have difficulty keeping portion sizes in check, a  prepared meal delivery service  could be a great option. While there are several to choose from,  Factor  and  Trifecta Nutrition  stand out for offering nutritionally balanced, low calorie meals designed to keep you satisfied.
Shake up your exercise routine:  If you have trouble finding motivation to move more, it may be helpful to try a new form of exercise. From hiking and kayaking to barre classes and  virtual workout classes , there are many ways to increase your physical activity.

Frequently asked questions
Some people may experience changes in bowel movements after taking Lipozene.
This is because Lipozene contains glucomannan, a type of fiber that has been shown to reduce constipation, increase the frequency of bowel movements, and possibly cause diarrhea ( 14 ,  15 ).
The active ingredient in Lipozene is glucomannan, a type of dietary fiber derived from the roots of the  konjac plant  ( 1 ).
According to the manufacturer, Lipozene does not contain any caffeine.
Some studies suggest that glucomannan, the active ingredient in Lipozene, could potentially support short-term weight loss. However, the research is mixed ( 9 ,  10 ).
Additionally, there is limited research on the long-term effectiveness of Lipozene, and it should not be used as a replacement for a balanced diet and active lifestyle.

The bottom line
While some studies suggest that the glucomannan in Lipozene could help you reach your weight loss goal, others have shown no benefit.
If you’re interested in trying glucomannan, you could get the same potential benefit from any glucomannan supplement — not just Lipozene.
However, this type of supplement is not a “silver bullet” for weight loss and won’t help you lose a significant amount of weight on its own.
To lose weight and keep it off, it’s important to follow a  balanced diet  and get regular physical activity.
