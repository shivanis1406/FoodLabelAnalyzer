Keep reading to learn more about garlic’s botanical and culinary classification and the benefits of eating it.

Botanical classification
Garlic is a vegetable in the  botanical family  of onions, known as Allium sativum. Other vegetables in this family include shallots, leeks, and chives.
A  vegetable  is any edible part of an herbaceous plant,  such as  the roots, leaves, stems, and bulbs.
Garlic comes from an edible plant with a bulb, tall stem, and long leaves. Therefore, it’s botanically considered a vegetable.
The bulb, comprised of 10 to 20 cloves, is most frequently eaten. It’s covered in a paper-like husk that’s typically removed before consumption. The leaves and flowers of the plant are also edible.

Culinary classification
Garlic is used more like a  spice or herb  than a vegetable, so many people think it’s a spice.
For instance, dry garlic is often used to add flavor to dishes, and it’s most commonly sold alongside other spices in grocery stores.
Unlike other vegetables, garlic is rarely consumed in large amounts or on its own. It’s usually added to dishes in small amounts because of its strong taste.
In fact, second only to  onions , it may be the most popular bulb used for flavor worldwide.
Garlic can be cooked either crushed, peeled, or whole. It’s commonly roasted, boiled, or sautéed. It can also be bought chopped, minced, pickled, or in supplement form.
It was previously believed that only  raw garlic  had health benefits. However,  studies  now show that cooked and commercially prepared products can be just as beneficial.

More potent than most other vegetables
Dietary guidelines recommend that fruits and vegetables comprise half of your plate during a meal, or about  800 grams (g)  (1.7 pounds) throughout the day.
However, there’s no need to fill half your plate with garlic.
This potent vegetable packs a variety of sulfur compounds, including allicin, which  accounts  for most of its medicinal properties.
Research shows that just 1 to 2 cloves (4 g) of garlic may have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that  could help :
reduce  cholesterol
lower blood pressure
prevent respiratory infections
boost immune function
Garlic may also play a role in preventing certain health conditions,  including :
diabetes
coronary heart disease
atherosclerosis
metabolic syndrome
osteoarthritis
some cancers, such as  colorectal  and  gastric  cancers
