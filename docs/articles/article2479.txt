Title: Foods to Lower Your Cancer Risk

A varied diet rich in whole foods may help lower your risk of developing cancer and decrease cancer growth. This diet can include fatty fish, vegetables, spices, and fruits such as berries.
What you eat can drastically affect many aspects of your health, including your risk of developing chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.
In particular, diet has been shown to heavily influence the development of cancer.
Many foods contain beneficial compounds that could help decrease cancer growth.
Several studies also show that a greater intake of certain foods could be associated with a lower risk of the disease.
This article will delve into the research and look at 13 foods that may help lower your risk of cancer.

1. Broccoli
Broccoli contains sulforaphane, a plant compound that’s found in cruciferous vegetables and may have potent anticancer properties.
One test-tube study in 2010 showed that sulforaphane reduced the size and number of breast cancer cells by  up to 75% .
Similarly, a 2004 animal study found that treating mice with sulforaphane helped kill off prostate cancer cells and reduced tumor volume by  more than 50% .
Some studies have also found that a greater intake of cruciferous  vegetables  such as broccoli may be linked to a lower risk of colorectal cancer.
One  analysis of 35 studies  showed that eating more cruciferous vegetables was associated with a lower risk of colorectal and colon cancer.
Including broccoli in a few meals per week may come with some cancer-fighting benefits.
But keep in mind that the available research hasn’t looked directly at how broccoli may affect cancer in humans.
Instead, it has been limited to test-tube, animal, and observational studies that either investigated the effects of cruciferous vegetables or the effects of a specific compound in broccoli. Thus, more studies are needed.
Summary:  Broccoli contains sulforaphane, a compound that has been shown to cause tumor cell death and reduce tumor size in test-tube and animal studies. A greater intake of cruciferous vegetables may also be associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer.

2. Carrots
Several studies have found that eating more carrots is linked to a decreased risk of certain types of cancer.
For example, the authors of a 2015 analysis looked at the results of 5 studies and concluded that eating carrots may reduce the risk of stomach cancer  by up to 26% .
Another research review found that a higher intake of carrots was associated with  18% lower odds  of developing prostate cancer.
The authors of one  study published in 1986  analyzed the diets of 1,266 participants with and without lung cancer. They found that current smokers who did not eat carrots were three times as likely to develop lung cancer as those who ate carrots more than once per week.
You can try incorporating carrots into your diet as a healthy snack or delicious side dish just a few times per week to increase your intake and potentially reduce your risk of cancer.
But remember that while these studies show an association between carrot consumption and cancer, they don’t account for other factors that may play a role.
Summary:  Some studies have found an association between carrot consumption and a decreased risk of prostate, lung, and stomach cancer.

3. Beans
Beans  are high in fiber, which  some studies  have found may help protect against colorectal cancer.
In one  2006 study , researchers followed 1,905 people with a history of colorectal tumors and found that those who consumed more cooked dried beans tended to have a decreased risk of tumor recurrence.
A 2002 animal study also found that feeding black beans or navy beans to rats and then inducing colon cancer blocked the development of cancer cells by  up to 75% .
These results suggest that eating a few servings of beans each week may increase your fiber intake and help lower your risk of developing cancer.
However, the current research is limited to animal studies and studies that show association but not causation. More studies are needed to examine this association in humans, specifically.
Summary:  Beans are high in fiber, which may help protect against colorectal cancer. Human and animal studies suggest that a higher intake of beans could reduce the risk of colorectal tumors and colon cancer.

4. Berries
Berries  are high in anthocyanins, which are plant pigments with antioxidant properties that may be associated with a reduced risk of cancer.
In one small study, after 25 people with colorectal cancer were treated with bilberry extract for 7 days, the growth of cancer cells  decreased by 7% .
In another  small study , researchers found that freeze-dried black raspberry powder helped decrease levels of certain markers associated with cancer progression in people with oral cancer.
In a 2001 animal study, researchers found that giving freeze-dried black raspberries to rats reduced the incidence of esophageal tumors by  up to 54%  and decreased the number of tumors by up to 62%.
Similarly, a  2006 animal study  showed that a berry extract could inhibit several biomarkers of cancer in rats.
Based on these findings, including a serving or two of berries in your diet each day may help reduce the development of cancer.
But keep in mind that these are animal and observational studies looking at the effects of a concentrated dose of berry extract rather than whole berries, and more human research is needed.
Summary:  Some test-tube and animal studies suggest that the compounds in berries may decrease the growth and spread of certain types of cancer.

5. Cinnamon
Cinnamon is well known for its health benefits, including its ability to  lower blood sugar  and  ease inflammation .
In addition, some test-tube and animal studies have found that cinnamon may help block the spread of cancer cells.
A  2010 study  using test tubes and animals found that cinnamon extract decreased the spread of cancer cells and induced their death.
Another test-tube study  showed that cinnamon essential oil suppressed the growth of head and neck cancer cells and significantly reduced tumor size.
Including 1/2 to 1 teaspoon (tsp), or 2 to 4 grams (g), of cinnamon in your diet each day may be beneficial in cancer prevention  and may also have  other  benefits , such as lowering blood sugar and decreasing inflammation.
However, more studies are needed to understand how cinnamon may affect cancer development in humans.
Summary:  Test-tube and animal studies suggest that cinnamon extract may have anticancer properties and may help decrease the growth and spread of tumors. But more research in humans is needed.

6. Nuts
Research has found that eating  nuts  may be linked to a lower risk of certain types of cancer.
For instance, in a  2015 study , researchers looked at the diets of 19,386 people and found that eating a greater amount of nuts was associated with a decreased risk of dying from cancer.
In a  2015 review  of studies with a total of 30,708 participants who were followed for up to 30 years, researchers concluded that eating nuts regularly was associated with a decreased risk of colorectal, pancreatic, and endometrial cancers.
Other studies have found that specific types of nuts may be linked to a lower cancer risk.
For example, Brazil nuts are high in selenium, which  may help protect  against lung cancer in people with low selenium levels.
Similarly, one  2014 review  of animal studies found that feeding walnuts to mice decreased the growth rate of breast cancer cells by 80% and reduced the number of tumors by 60%.
These results suggest that adding a serving of nuts to your diet each day may reduce your risk of developing cancer in the future.
Still, more studies in humans are needed to determine whether nuts are responsible for this association or whether other factors are involved.
Summary:  Some studies suggest that an increased intake of nuts may decrease the risk of cancer. Research suggests that some specific types, such as Brazil nuts and walnuts, may be linked to a lower risk of cancer.

7. Olive oil
Olive oil is loaded with  health benefits , so it’s no wonder it’s one of the staples of the Mediterranean diet.
Several studies have even found that a higher intake of olive oil may help protect against cancer.
One  2011 review  of 19 studies concluded that people who consumed the most olive oil had a lower risk of developing breast cancer and digestive system cancers than those who consumed the least.
Another  study published in 2000  examined the cancer rates in 28 countries worldwide and found that areas with a higher intake of olive oil had lower rates of colorectal cancer.
Replacing other oils in your diet with olive oil is a simple way to take advantage of its health benefits. You can drizzle it over salads and cooked vegetables or try using it in marinades for meat, fish, or poultry.
Though these studies suggest that there may be an association between olive oil intake and cancer, other factors are likely involved as well. More studies are needed to examine the direct effects of olive oil on cancer in humans.
Summary:  Several studies suggest that a higher intake of olive oil may be associated with a reduced risk of certain types of cancer.

8. Turmeric
Turmeric is a spice well known for its  health-promoting properties . Curcumin, its active ingredient, is a chemical that has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and even anticancer effects.
In one small  2011 study , researchers examined the effects of curcumin in 44 people with colon lesions that could have become cancerous. Among participants who consumed 4 g of curcumin daily for 30 days, the number of lesions decreased by 40%.
In a 2014  test-tube study , curcumin was also found to decrease the spread of colon cancer cells by targeting a specific enzyme related to cancer growth.
Another test-tube study showed that curcumin  helped kill off  head and neck cancer cells.
Other test-tube studies have found curcumin to be effective in slowing the growth  of  lung ,  breast , and  prostate  cancer cells.
For the best results, aim to consume 1/2 to 3 tsp (1 to 3 g) of ground turmeric per day. You can use the ground spice to add flavor to foods. Pairing it with black pepper helps boost its absorption.
Summary:  Turmeric contains curcumin, a chemical that has been shown to reduce the growth of many types of cancer and lesions in test-tube and human studies.

9. Citrus fruits
Eating  citrus fruits  such as lemons, limes, grapefruits, and oranges has been associated with a lower risk of cancer.
In one  large study  in 2010, participants who had high intake of citrus fruits had a lower risk of developing digestive and upper respiratory tract cancers.
A  2009 review  of nine studies also found that a greater intake of citrus fruits was linked to a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer.
Finally, a  2008 review  of 14 studies showed that a high intake of citrus fruit — at least 3 servings per week — reduced the risk of stomach cancer by 28%.
These studies suggest that including a few servings of citrus fruits in your diet each week may lower your risk of developing certain types of cancer.
But keep in mind that these studies don’t account for other factors that may be involved. More studies are needed on how citrus fruits specifically affect cancer development.
Summary:  Studies have found that a higher intake of citrus fruits could decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, including cancers of the pancreas, stomach, digestive tract, and upper respiratory tract.

10. Flaxseed
High in fiber and heart-healthy fats, flaxseed can be a nutritious addition to your diet.
Some research has shown that it may even help decrease cancer growth and kill off cancer cells.
In one  2005 study , 32 women with breast cancer received either a flaxseed muffin daily or a placebo for more than a month. At the end of the study, the flaxseed group had decreased levels of specific markers of tumor growth, as well as an increase in cancer cell death.
In a  2008 study , flaxseed was found to reduce the growth and spread of cancer cells in men with prostate cancer.
Flaxseed is high in fiber, which  studies  have found to be protective against colorectal cancer.
You can try adding 1 tablespoon (10 g) of ground  flaxseed  to your diet each day by mixing it into smoothies, sprinkling it over cereal or yogurt, or adding it to your favorite baked goods.
Summary:  Some studies have found that flaxseed may reduce cancer growth in breast and prostate cancers. It is also high in fiber, which may decrease the risk of colorectal cancer.

11. Tomatoes
Lycopene is a compound found in tomatoes that is responsible for their vibrant red color and may have anticancer properties.
Several studies suggest that an increased intake of lycopene and tomatoes could lead to a reduced risk of prostate cancer.
A  2013 review  of 17 studies found that a higher intake of raw tomatoes, cooked tomatoes, and lycopene were all associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer.
A  2002 study  that included 47,365 people found that a greater intake of tomato sauce, in particular, was linked to a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
To help increase your intake, you can include a serving or two of tomatoes in your diet each day by adding them to sandwiches, salads, sauces, or pasta dishes.
But remember that while these studies suggest an association between eating tomatoes and a reduced risk of prostate cancer, they don’t account for other factors that could be involved.
Summary:  Some studies have found that a higher intake of tomatoes and lycopene could reduce the risk of prostate cancer. However, more studies are needed.

12. Garlic
The active component in  garlic  is allicin, a compound that has been shown to  kill off cancer cells  in test-tube studies.
Several studies have found an association between garlic intake and a lower risk of certain types of cancer.
A  2011 review of studies  with a total of 543,220 participants found that those who ate lots of allium vegetables, such as garlic, onions, leeks, and shallots, had a lower risk of stomach cancer than those who rarely consumed those vegetables.
A  2002 study  of 471 men found that a higher intake of garlic was associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer.
A  2007 study  also found that participants who ate lots of garlic as well as fruit, deep yellow vegetables, dark green vegetables, and onions were less likely to develop colorectal tumors. However, this study did not isolate the effects of garlic.
Based on these findings, including 2 to 5 g (about one clove) of fresh garlic into your diet each day can help you take advantage of its health-promoting properties.
However, despite the promising results showing an association between garlic and a reduced risk of cancer, more studies are needed to examine whether other factors play a role.
Summary:  Garlic contains allicin, a compound that has been shown to kill cancer cells in test-tube studies. Studies suggest that eating more garlic could lead to decreased risks of stomach, prostate, and colorectal cancers.

13. Fatty fish
Some research suggests that including a few servings of  fish  in your diet each week may reduce your risk of cancer.
One  large study in 1999  showed that a higher intake of fish was associated with a lower risk of digestive tract cancer.
A  2005 study  involving 478,040 adults found that eating more fish decreased the risk of developing colorectal cancer, while red and processed meats actually increased the risk.
In particular, fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and anchovies contain important nutrients such as vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, which have been linked to a lower risk of cancer.
For example, having adequate  vitamin D  levels is  believed  to protect against and reduce the risk of cancer.
Additionally, omega-3 fatty acids  are thought  to block the development of the disease.
Aim for two servings of fatty fish per week to get a hearty dose of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D and to maximize the potential health benefits of these nutrients.
Still, more research is needed to determine how fatty fish consumption may directly influence the risk of cancer in humans.
Summary:  Fish consumption may decrease the risk of cancer. Fatty fish contains vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, two nutrients that are believed to protect against cancer.

The bottom line
As new research continues to emerge, it has become increasingly clear that your diet can have a major impact on your cancer risk.
Still, while many foods may have the potential to reduce the spread and growth of cancer cells, current research is limited to test-tube, animal, and observational studies.
More studies are needed to understand how these foods may directly affect cancer development in humans.
In the meantime, it’s a safe bet that a diet rich in  whole foods,  paired with a healthy lifestyle, will help improve many aspects of your health.
