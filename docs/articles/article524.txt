Title: What to Know About the Creatine Loading Phase

During the creatine loading phase, you take high doses of creatine for 5 to 7 days before moving on to lower maintenance doses. This may be the quickest way to reap the benefits of creatine.
Creatine is a compound stored in your muscles. Your body naturally produces creatine, but foods like meat and fish also contain it.
If you eat a typical omnivorous diet, you take in about  1 to 2 grams (g)  of creatine each day, but your muscle stores of creatine are still only 60% to 80% full.
Taking creatine supplements may help maximize your muscle stores.
Some trainers recommend a creatine “loading phase” when you start supplementing. During this phase, you consume a relatively large amount of creatine over a short period to rapidly saturate your muscles.
A common approach is to take  20 to 25 g  of creatine daily for 5 to 7 days. This dose is typically divided into four or five 5-g servings throughout the day.
After the loading phase, you can maintain your stores of creatine by taking a 3 to 5 g dose daily.

Research on creatine loading
Some research suggests creatine loading may help boost muscle stores of creatine by  20% to 40% .
However, other studies have found that lower doses of  creatine  taken once daily can be equally effective at maximizing your stores of creatine, though it may take a bit longer.
A  1996 study  in male participants found that muscles can become fully saturated after taking 3 g of creatine daily for 28 days.
Similarly, a  2022 study  in males found that taking 3 g of creatine for 28 days helped increase creatine store levels compared to participants who did not take creatine.
This method may take 3 additional weeks to maximize your muscle stores compared to creatine loading, so you may have to wait longer to see the  benefits of creatine .
There are fewer studies on creatine use in people assigned female at birth.
However, a large  2021 review  found that creatine supplementation may have several benefits for females, regardless of whether they undergo a loading phase or a gradual approach.
In a  6-week study  involving male and female college students, some students took a performance supplement containing 4 g of creatine and varying amounts of electrolytes. Others took a placebo.
Researchers stated a creatine loading phase wasn’t conducted because taking lower maintenance doses of the performance supplement would produce the same results.
In the end, students who took the performance supplement improved their back squats and bench presses, even without a loading phase.

Benefits of creatine loading
A creatine loading phase may be the fastest way to benefit from creatine’s effects. Some benefits of maximizing your muscle stores of creatine  include :
Muscle gain:  Studies consistently tie creatine supplements to significant increases in  muscle mass  when combined with resistance training.
Muscle strength:  After creatine loading, strength and power may increase.
Improved performance:  After creatine loading, performance during high intensity exercise may jump.
Injury prevention:  In many studies, athletes using creatine reported less muscle tightness and fewer sport-related injuries (like strains) than non-users.

Creatine side effects
Several studies demonstrate that creatine is safe over short- and long-term periods.
According to the  International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) , up to 30 g per day for 5 years may be safe and is generally well tolerated by healthy individuals.
Though rare, some people have reported gastrointestinal issues like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Creatine may also  cause  temporary weight gain and  bloating , as it may increase water retention in your muscles.
While it’s commonly believed that creatine may increase your risk of dehydration, cramping, and heat illness, current  research  contradicts these claims.
Since your kidneys metabolize creatine, creatine supplements may worsen kidney function in people with  renal disease .
It’s best to speak with a healthcare professional before using supplements if you have an underlying health issue or are pregnant or nursing.

How to creatine load
Creatine supplements are widely available in stores and online. The most well-studied form is  creatine monohydrate .
Studies suggest taking  5 g  of creatine monohydrate four or five times daily for 5 to 7 days is the most effective way to increase your muscle creatine levels.
However, recommended amounts may vary depending on your weight. According to the  ISSN , you can determine your daily dose for the loading phase by multiplying your weight in kilograms (kg) by 0.3.
For example, during the loading phase, an individual weighing 80 kg (176 pounds) would consume 24 g (80 x 0.3) of creatine daily.
After 7 days, a daily maintenance dose of  3 to 5 g  can help you maintain high levels.
If you stop taking creatine, your muscle stores will gradually decrease to the levels they were at before you started supplementing.

Frequently asked questions
In most cases, taking a 20 g dose of creatine at once is fine. However, research focuses on dividing this daily dosage into four or five doses throughout the day to maximize the benefits.
Creatine loading may provide benefits quicker, but research suggests it’s not necessary to experience creatine’s benefits.
Taking 10 g of creatine is more than the typical 3 to 5 g daily maintenance dose. However, research suggests the loading phase should comprise  20 to 25 g  of creatine daily for 5 to 7 days.
Research suggests taking  20 to 25 g  of creatine monohydrate for 5 to 7 days. This daily dose is most commonly divided into 5 g servings throughout the day. After the loading phase, you can take 3 to 5 g doses daily to maintain creatine stores.

Takeaway
It’s possible to maximize your muscle stores of creatine gradually over several weeks.
However, the fastest way to maximize your muscle stores is a weeklong loading phase followed by lower doses to maintain high levels.
These benefits include increased muscle mass and strength, improved performance, and a reduced risk of sport-related injuries.
If you’re unsure whether creatine is right for you, speak with a healthcare professional. They can help determine the best dosage for you.
