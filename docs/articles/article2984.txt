BOTTOM LINE: The Vertical Diet is meant to aid muscle gain and improve performance by eating easily digestible foods, as well as red meat and white rice to boost protein and carb intake. Though it may be effective, it’s limited in variety, low in fiber, and may not work for everyone.

What is the Vertical Diet?
The Vertical Diet was developed by Stan Efferding, an elite powerlifter, to enhance performance in bodybuilders, powerlifters, and serious athletes.
The program also claims to work for casual gym-goers who are looking to  increase muscle mass  or lose weight.
Unlike traditional “horizontal” diets emphasizing dietary variety across numerous food groups, the Vertical Diet focuses on a limited number of high quality, nutrient-rich foods.
According to Efferding, limiting variety makes your body more efficient at digesting and absorbing nutrients, improving muscle growth, recovery,  gut health , and metabolism.
That said, these claims are not backed by scientific evidence.

How to follow the Vertical Diet
The Vertical Diet has several components, all of which are meant to maximize muscle gain.
While designed to be high in carbs, the diet can also be customized to meet a variety of eating patterns, including  low carb diets ,  intermittent fasting , and the  paleo diet .
Red meat and white rice comprise the bulk of the Vertical Diet.
According to the diet’s advocates,  white rice  is the primary carb source because it’s easy to digest, especially in large quantities. This is particularly important for serious athletes with very high calorie needs.
Red meat  is preferred over poultry or fish due to its nutrient density and concentration of iron, B vitamins, zinc, and cholesterol, which the diet claims are important for  muscle growth  and  testosterone production .
However, as you can’t meet all your  micronutrient  needs with these two foods, the diet includes a limited amount of nutrient-rich, easily digestible foods, such as eggs, yogurt, spinach, and salmon.
All foods that aren’t easily digestible are discouraged.
These include vegetables that may cause bloating and gas, such as broccoli and cauliflower, which are high in  FODMAPs , as well as onion and garlic.
Legumes, brown rice, and other grains are also curbed because they contain lectins and  phytic acid , which may limit your absorption of certain nutrients.
However, small amounts of legumes and oats are allowed as long as they’re sprouted or soaked to make them easier to digest.
When starting out, you calculate your  basal metabolic rate  (BMR), or the number of calories your body needs to function while at rest. You then add calories based on your training regimen. Bodybuilders should aim for a calorie surplus to gain muscle weight.
As your body adjusts to the diet and starts to feel hungry between meals, you’re supposed to “go vertical” by adding more calories. This process is meant to support greater muscle gains, quicker recovery, and more intense or frequent training sessions.
The exact number of additional calories is based on training needs and involves either increasing your portions of rice and meat or eating an  additional meal  during the day.
Once you start feeling hungry between meals again, you repeat this process until you’ve reached your goal weight or goal muscle mass.

Potential benefits
Bodybuilders, powerlifters, and other athletes looking to gain muscle mass may find that the Vertical Diet fits their needs.
It may also benefit those who want to lose weight or have difficulty digesting FODMAPs.
A calorie surplus is important for gaining muscle, especially for  bodybuilders , powerlifters, and other serious athletes.
By focusing on easily digestible foods, the Vertical Diet makes it easier to eat frequent, high-calorie meals without experiencing digestive side effects.
Furthermore, the diet emphasizes increasing your  carb intake , which can help boost muscle mass.
Studies show that adequate carb intake before training can  enhance  athletic performance. Carbs may also  increase  protein synthesis and reduce muscle breakdown.
Diets low in FODMAPs — foods that the Vertical Diet limits — have  been shown  to significantly reduce digestive symptoms, such as bloating, stomach cramps, constipation, and diarrhea, in people with  irritable bowel syndrome  (IBS).
Bodybuilders and other athletes who need frequent, high calorie meals may also benefit, as low-FODMAP foods reduce your risk of bloating.  Bloating  may otherwise impair your muscle and weight gain by limiting your food intake.
Still, some high-FODMAP foods are allowed on the Vertical Diet, including milk, yogurt, apples, cherries, figs, and other fruits.
Therefore, you may want to avoid these foods if you have IBS.

Potential downsides
It’s important to note that the Vertical Diet has numerous downsides, including being:
Low in fiber.  Adequate  fiber intake  aids fullness, heart health, and digestive health. It  may also  lower the risk of chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and certain forms of cancer.
Low in prebiotics.  Despite claims that it boosts gut health, the Vertical Diet excludes many  important sources  of prebiotics — dietary fiber that feeds the beneficial bacteria in your gut — including garlic, onions, and barley.
Limited in variety.  The diet is restrictive and repetitive, making long-term adherence difficult. It  may also  lead to  nutrient deficiencies  if not planned correctly.
Inappropriate for vegetarians or vegans.  As the Vertical Diet emphasizes red meat intake while limiting vegetable, grain, and legume intake, it’s unsuitable for people who are  vegetarian  or  vegan .
Expensive to follow.  While white rice is usually cheap, the other components of the Vertical Diet can be costly — especially considering the recommendation to buy only high-quality foods, such as grass-fed beef and organic produce.

Foods to eat
The Vertical Diet emphasizes red meat and white rice while offering limited amounts of other items. Foods you can eat on this diet include:
Rice:  white only
Red meat:  beef, lamb, bison, and venison
Fruits:  mostly oranges, 100% orange juice, cranberries, and 100% cranberry juice — but all fruits are allowed
Potatoes:  white and sweet potatoes
Low-FODMAP vegetables:  carrots, celery, zucchini, cucumber, bell peppers, eggplant, spinach, butternut squash
Oils and fats:  extra-virgin olive oil, coconut oil, avocado oil, butter, nuts

Eggs:  whole eggs
Dairy:  full-fat yogurt, whole milk, cheese
Sodium:  bone broth, chicken stock, iodized table salt
Poultry:  chicken, turkey

Legumes:  beans and other legumes, only if soaked and fermented
The diet likewise encourages eating high-quality foods, such as grass-fed meats, free-range eggs, and  organic  fruits and vegetables.

Foods to avoid
The Vertical Diet discourages foods it considers difficult to digest, as well as highly processed foods, including:
Grains:  brown rice, bread, pasta,  breakfast cereals , wheat flour, unsoaked oats
Legumes:  unsoaked lentils, beans, soy, peas, peanuts
Highly processed vegetable oils:  canola, soybean, corn, safflower
Onions and garlic:  all forms of onion, garlic, and shallots
High-FODMAP vegetables:  broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, asparagus, kale
Sugar alcohols:  erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol
Added sugar:  candy, pastries, baked goods, soda, sports drinks
Coffee:  regular and decaf
Other beverages:  alkalized water
Remember that the diet permits small amounts of some of these foods as long as your body can digest them without any digestive symptoms, such as gas or bloating.
However,  processed vegetable oils  are never allowed.

The bottom line
The Vertical Diet is meant to help bodybuilders and other serious athletes gain muscle mass and improve performance.
It includes easily digestible foods to help your body absorb nutrients more efficiently and prevent digestive side effects, such as bloating. To boost protein and carb intake, it emphasizes eating increasingly large portions of red meat and white rice.
If you work out consistently and seek ways to boost muscle and gain weight, the Vertical Diet could be worth trying.
