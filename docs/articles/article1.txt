Title: Hiya Vitamins Review By a Mom Who Is a Dietitian

Hiya vitamins are all over social media thanks to their whole foods-based ingredients and zero sugar. But are they worth the cost? Here’s my Hiya vitamins review after trying with my toddler.
Despite your best efforts, getting your toddler to eat a well-balanced diet isn’t always possible. Whether you have a picky eater or a wiggle worm who doesn’t stay at the table for more than one or two bites, a multivitamin can be helpful for making sure your child gets their nutrients.
As a dietitian with a 3-year-old, I was instantly drawn to Hiya as a healthier alternative to the gummy vitamins my toddler was regularly taking. Hiya was founded by a dad who wanted to create  kids’ vitamins  that don’t contain added sugar or artificial additives.
So are they worth it? Yes and no. But keep reading for my perspective as a dietitian and whether my toddler actually liked the products he tried.

The tl;dr
The  multivitamin  was a great solution for us, and my toddler took it for a year without complaint. He started to get bored after that, but I’d consider resubscribing in the future.
The  Bedtime Essentials  supplement ultimately wasn’t helpful for us, but it could be for other kids, and the ingredients seem to be of good quality.
The  greens powder  was a great addition to dessert smoothies, and my toddler was a fan.

Pros and cons of Hiya vitamins
free of added sugar, gluten, dairy, and artificial additives and dyes
third-party tested for heavy metals, allergens, and pathogens
sweetened with monk fruit extract
initial shipment arrives in a refillable glass jar, plus stickers for decorating
subsequent months shipped in no-plastic refill pouches
subscription options for households with one to five kids
relatively expensive
not suitable for kids under 2 years old
requires a subscription
no omega-3 supplement available
some kids may have difficulty transitioning away from gummy vitamins

Ingredient quality and testing
Hiya supplements are formulated with whole food-based ingredients. They’re naturally sweetened with a blend of monk fruit extract and mannitol, a  sugar alcohol  that provides sweetness but doesn’t get broken down by oral bacteria to form cavities.
In addition to being free of added sugars, Hiya’s products are made without artificial dyes, additives, and preservatives. They’re also free of major allergens and produced in a peanut-free facility.
Hiya’s facilities are  current good manufacturing practices (CGMP) certified  and located in the United States. Its products are also third-party tested by accredited labs for evidence of heavy metals, allergens, and pathogens as well as purity and potency of the ingredients to ensure the correct amount are included.

I obtained my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Nutritional Science from Boston University.
I have worked has nutrition editor, a clinical dietitian at two Boston hospitals, and a nutrition researcher for the University of Colorado and Children’s Hospital.
I have also worked as a freelance writer and editor for several online publications.

Recommended age   2 years and older

Hiya Kids Daily Multivitamin is the company’s flagship product. Unlike traditional kids’ vitamins that come in candy-like gummy form, these chewable tablets are free from added sugar, gelatin, dyes, and artificial additives.
Plus, because they’re sweetened with monk fruit and mannitol instead of sugar, they’re less likely to cause cavities.
Each 1 tablet serving contains 15 essential vitamins and minerals to support your kid’s growth, development, and overall health.
These nutrients include:
vitamins A, C, D, and E
B vitamins, including folate, thiamine, riboflavin, biotin, pantothenic acid, and B12
calcium
iodine
zinc
selenium
manganese
Notably missing from the multivitamin is iron. While iron is an important nutrient for kids to get enough of, consuming too much iron, especially through supplements, can lead to  iron poisoning .
For kids with anemia who are unable to meet their iron needs through diet alone, pediatricians may recommend taking an iron supplement.
As a dietitian and mom of a picky toddler who can’t sit still for more than a few minutes, I’ve spent quite a bit of time researching vitamins for toddlers.
Initially, I started my son on a multivitamin with omega-3s since we’re not big fish eaters. While it was a good fit initially, my son quickly started calling his multivitamin “candy” and would regularly try to find the bottle to eat more. This  safety concern  combined with wanting a sugar-free option brought me to Hiya.
My son has been taking Hiya vitamins off and on for the past year. Because he loved his gummies, I was surprised by how quickly he took to the chewable tablets. He had no issue taking one tablet per day and loved decorating his bottle with the stickers.
As a busy mom, I appreciated having the multivitamins automatically sent each month and was even more impressed that the tablets almost always arrived in good condition — occasionally one or two would be broken.
However, after about 11 months, my toddler started refusing to take the multivitamin saying that he was bored of the taste. Because I didn’t want a stockpile of multivitamins, I ultimately canceled my subscription after 1 year.
That said, I’m still overall impressed with these vitamins and would consider resubscribing. I would also love to see the company offer an omega-3 supplement. While I can order one separately on Amazon, it’d be convenient to get them both from one place.

Hiya Kids Daily Iron+ offers 7 milligrams (mg) of iron carbonyl, a  form of iron  that may cause fewer gastrointestinal (GI) side effects than other forms of iron. The supplement also contains vitamin C, which has been  shown  to help improve the absorption of iron.
Each 1-tablet serving provides 100% of the daily value (DV) for iron in kids under 4 years of age and 39% of the DV for kids 4 years and older.
As with all Hiya products, Kids Daily Iron+ is free of added sugars, gluten, dairy, and artificial additives. This product is also vegan-friendly.
Iron is an essential nutrient that helps move oxygen throughout the body, and being  deficient in iron  can have numerous consequences for a kid’s growth and development. Many kids are able to meet their iron needs by eating iron-rich foods, such as meats, chicken, fish, beans, and iron fortified cereal.
Kids who aren’t able to get enough iron through their diet might benefit from an iron supplement, like this one from Hiya. However, because kids are more susceptible to  iron toxicity , it’s important to consult a pediatrician first.

Hiya Kids Bedtime Essentials is a supplement designed to help kids relax their bodies and have a more restful sleep. It contains seven vitamins and minerals that may have some benefits for sleep and relaxation, including:
vitamin B6
calcium
magnesium
L-theanine
choline
gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)
chamomile flower extract
You’ll notice that melatonin isn’t on the list. While melatonin is thought to be safe for short-term (and possibly long-term) use in adults and adolescents,  melatonin’s safety in children  hasn’t been evaluated. In addition to concerns around melatonin overdose, it’s unclear whether melatonin is habit-forming in young kids.
Hiya Kids Bedtime Essentials has over 7,600 five-star reviews, with parents sharing that the supplement help their kids wind down at night. Still, keep in mind that the effectiveness of this supplement hasn’t been studied and will likely vary by kid.
Lastly, it’s worth noting that the Bedtime Essentials formulation doesn’t overlap with the company’s multivitamin, meaning that it’s OK for kids to take both, unless advised otherwise by a pediatrician.
I added Bedtime Essentials to my subscription after months of  nighttime battles  with my son. While all toddlers have energy at night, my son seemed to have a particularly difficult time relaxing his body and mind.
After trying everything from changing his diet (especially at night) to tweaking screen time to adjusting his bedtime routine and providing firm all-over hugs, I figured this supplement was worth a try.
Adding the Bedtime Essentials to my subscription was easy, and as with the multivitamin, I liked having the refillable bottle. My son also enjoyed the taste of the tablets.
However, the supplement wasn’t the right fit for my son. After 1 month of use, I didn’t notice any positive changes in his energy at night; in fact, he seemed to be more hyper after taking them.
Of course, this energy boost could have just been a coincidence and not due to the supplement. Still, because I’d rather not have my toddler taking supplements he doesn’t need, I ultimately canceled my subscription.

Hiya Kids Daily Probiotic provides 10 billion colony forming units (CFUs) in each chewable tablet to support your child’s immune and gut health. Specifically, the product contains two probiotic strains, Lactobacillus rhamnosus (GG) and Lactobacillus paracasei (Lpc-37).
Lactobacillus rhamnosus  is one of the most studied probiotic strains. It’s been shown to be beneficial for treating acute diarrhea and promoting overall gut health. Lactobacillus paracasei isn’t as well studied. However,  research  suggests that it may support overall immune health and protect against the common cold.
The product also contains Bacillus lactis, a type of prebiotic fiber that helps support the growth of beneficial bacteria.
Keep in mind that while probiotics can be helpful in certain situations, especially if your child regularly experiences GI issues,  probiotic supplements  aren’t necessary or appropriate for all kids. As with any supplement, always talk with a pediatrician before adding a new supplement to your child’s routine.

Hiya Kids Daily Greens + Superfoods offers 55 ingredients derived from whole foods — including broccoli, spinach, cucumber, flax seeds, and more — to expose your kid to a wider variety of nutrients in the form of a creamy, chocolatey drink.

Unlike most greens powders, which are formulated for adults, Hiya Daily Greens is specifically designed to provide types and amounts of ingredients that are safe for kids.

The powder contains four blends, including an Essential Greens Blend, Digestion Blend, Superfoods Blend, and Core Development Blend. It also provides 50% of the DV of vitamin D for kids ages 2 to 3 years old.

To serve, simply add 1 scoop to a glass of milk and stir. You can also add it to smoothies, plain yogurt, or oatmeal.

Just keep in mind that while the powder may provide an extra boost of nutrition to your kid’s diet, it isn’t meant to be a replacement for whole fruits and vegetables.


While I don’t use it every day, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by Hiya Kids Daily Greens + Superfoods. I’m not a huge fan of adult greens powders; however, I like that this product is formulated with kids in mind and only includes recognizable whole foods, like Brussels sprouts and beets.

The powder mixes relatively easily into a glass of milk, though my favorite way to serve it is in a smoothie. I’ve been making “dessert” smoothies for my son with milk, frozen bananas, spinach, peanut butter, frozen blueberries, and a scoop of this powder. My toddler has been loving it!

The powder provides a pleasant chocolate flavor that isn’t overly sweet, and I like that it’s a convenient way to add additional nutrients that my kiddo might not otherwise get.

My only hesitations are the $54 price tag and required subscription. I think if it were cheaper or you could just buy it occasionally, I’d be able to justify keeping it stocked in our pantry.

Potential downsides
The biggest downside of Hiya vitamins is the price, with most supplements costing $1 or more per serving. Plus, unlike many other brands, you can only get Hiya vitamins by subscribing through the company’s website.
Hiya products are formulated for kids ages 2 years and up. However, because  nutrient needs  continue to change as kids get older, Hiya vitamins may not be the best fit once kids turn 9 years old.
Finally, it’s worth noting that not every kid needs a multivitamin or other dietary supplement. If you’re unsure of whether your child is meeting their nutrient needs, it’s best to talk with a registered dietitian, pediatrician, or other healthcare professional first.
When shopping for kid’s supplements, it’s important to keep in mind that kids metabolize nutrients differently than adults and are more susceptible to nutrient overdoses.
Here are some tips to reduce the risk of  vitamin toxicity :
Purchase supplements that are specifically formulated for your child’s age.
If they’re taking multiple supplements, make sure to check for any nutrient overlaps.
Always tightly seal supplement bottles and store them out of reach.
Follow label instructions for dosing, unless recommended otherwise by a pediatrician.
If your child is currently taking medications, check with your pediatrician about any potential drug interactions.
While Hiya states that each of its products is designed with limited nutrient overlap, it’s still best to double-check with your pediatrician.
Hiya vitamins are manufactured in a peanut-free facility and are free of major allergens. However, because there’s still a risk for cross-contamination for allergies other than peanuts, the brand might not be the best fit for kids with severe food allergies.

Alternatives to Hiya vitamins
If Hiya feels too expensive or it doesn’t quite meet your child’s needs, there are several other kids’ vitamin companies to consider. Below is a quick look at some of the more popular alternatives to Hiya.
$  = under $0.30 per serving
$$  = $0.30 to $1.00 per serving
$$$  = over $1.00 per serving
Note that serving sizes or the recommended number of servings per day may vary depending on your child’s age, which may affect the monthly cost of a product.

Signing up for Hiya
Hiya is a subscription-based service that is customizable based on the number of kids in your household.
To get started, you’ll select which products you want to add to your subscription and whether you’re purchasing for one or multiple kids in your household.
The first shipment includes a 30-day supply, a reusable glass bottle, and stickers for your kids to decorate their containers with. Each month thereafter, you’ll receive refills in recyclable pouches.
You can adjust your account online or by emailing the company’s support team. I’ve had to make adjustments to my subscription, and each time I’ve needed help, the company’s support team has been quick to respond and make the requested changes.

Frequently asked questions
Hiya and Olly are both reputable kids’ vitamin brands. However, they differ in the types of ingredients and amount of sugar present in their products.
Hiya vitamins come in chewable tablets rather than gummies and are free from added sugar. They also contain fewer added ingredients and are suitable for kids with peanut allergies.
However, Olly kids’ vitamins are generally less expensive and easier to find online and in stores. They’re also NSF certified to ensure both purity and potency, while Hiya vitamins are only third-party tested for potency.

The majority of Hiya’s nutrients are sourced from whole foods and aren’t synthetic. However, some nutrients, like calcium, don’t have food sources listed and could be synthetic.
The brand confirmed the greens powder does not have any synthetic ingredients and said that Hiya tablets consist of whole food ingredients where a natural source exists.

The bottom line
Overall, we found Hiya to offer high quality supplements that are free of added sugar and artificial additives, which are commonly found in other kids’ vitamin brands.
We also liked that supplements come in refillable glass bottles and that each month’s supply is automatically renewed and shipped to your door. Several products even passed the toddler taste test.
Still, Hiya might not be right for everyone. The supplements aren’t cheap, and they’re only available through the company’s website. Hiya also has fewer supplement options compared with several other brands, though Hiya’s product offerings may expand over time.
Whether you decide to try Hiya or opt for a different brand, make sure to talk with a pediatrician before starting your child on any new supplements.
