Title: 20 Foods High in Vitamin A

Certain vegetables and fruits, as well as animal products, are good sources of vitamin A. This includes kale, spinach, mango, and guava, as well as beef, chicken, fish, cheese, and eggs.
Vitamin A is a  fat-soluble vitamin  that  plays an essential role  in maintaining vision, body growth, immune function, and reproductive health.
Getting adequate amounts from your diet should prevent the symptoms of  vitamin A deficiency . While most people in developed countries get enough vitamin A from their diet, this deficiency is a leading cause of blindness in developing countries.
The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) is  900 micrograms (mcg)  for males assigned at birth (MAABs), 700 mcg for females assigned at birth (FAABs), and 300–500 mcg for children and adolescents.
The RDA provides enough vitamin A for the vast majority of people. In fact, a daily value (DV) of  900 mcg  is used as a reference on nutrition labels in the United States and Canada.
This article lists 20 animal and plant foods rich in sources of vitamin A (retinol), including preformed vitamin A and provitamin A  carotenoids , such as  beta-carotene , which convert to retinol in the body.

Vitamin A1, also known as retinol, is only found in animal-sourced foods, such as oily fish, liver, cheese, and butter.
Here are some of the best sources of vitamin A1.

3.5 oz (100 g) contains 7,780 mcg of retinol, or  864%  of the DV.
3.5 oz (100 g) contains 8,310 mcg of retinol, or  923%  of the DV.
1 tablespoon (tbsp), or 14 g, contains 4,080 mcg of retinol, or  453%  of the DV.
3.5 oz (100 g) contains 252 mcg of retinol, or  28%  of the DV.
3.5 oz (100 g) contains 69 mcg of retinol, or  8%  of the DV.

What vegetables have vitamin A?
Your body can produce vitamin A from  carotenoids  found in plants.
These carotenoids include beta-carotene and alpha-carotene, collectively known as provitamin A.
However, about  45%  of people carry a genetic mutation that significantly reduces their ability to convert provitamin A into vitamin A.
Depending on your genetics, the following vegetables might provide considerably less vitamin A than indicated.
1 cup (200 g) contains 1,920 mcg retinol activity equivalents (RAE), or  213%  of the DV.
1 cup (205 g) contains 1,140 mcg RAE, or  127%  of the DV.
1 cup (118 g) contains 172 mcg RAE, or  19%  of the DV.
1 cup (190 g) contains 722 mcg RAE, or  80%  of the DV.
1 cup (144 g) contains 549 mcg RAE, or  61%  of the DV.
1 cup (155 g) contains 1,280 mcg RAE, or  142%  of the DV.
1 large (164 g) sweet red pepper contains 257 mcg RAE, or  29%  of the DV.
1 cup (175 g) contains 536 mcg RAE, or  60%  of the DV.
1 cup (180 g) contains 943 mcg RAE, or  105%  of the DV.
1 cup (47 g) contains 205 mcg RAE, or  23%  of the DV.

What fruits have vitamin A?
Provitamin A is generally more abundant in vegetables than fruits.
However, a few types of fruit provide good amounts, as shown below.
1 cup (165 g) contains 89 mcg RAE, or  10%  of the DV.
1 cup (160 g) contains 270 mcg RAE, or  30%  of the DV.
Half a grapefruit (154 g) contains 89 mcg RAE, or  10%  of the DV.
1 cup (155 g) contains 43 mcg RAE, or  5%  of the DV.
1 cup (165 g) contains 78 mcg RAE, or  9%  of the DV.
Two apricots (70 g) contain 67 mcg RAE, or  7%  of the DV.
One tangerine (109 g) contains 37 mcg RAE, or  4%  of the DV.
One nectarine (140 g) contains 29 mcg RAE, or  3%  of the DV.
Two guavas (110 g) contain 34 mcg RAE, or  4%  of the DV.
Two passion fruits (36 g) contain 23 mcg RAE, or  3%  of the DV.

Frequently asked questions
You can easily meet your requirements for vitamin A by regularly eating some of the foods listed in this article. Many foods also contain added vitamin A, including cereals, margarine, and  dairy products .
Since vitamin A is fat-soluble, it is more efficiently absorbed into the bloodstream when eaten with fat. Most animal-sourced foods rich in  vitamin A  are also high in fat, but the same doesn’t apply to most plant sources of provitamin A.
You can improve your absorption of provitamin A from plant sources by adding a dash of oil to your salad.
However, as mentioned above, some people have a  genetic mutation  that makes the conversion of provitamin A into vitamin A much less efficient.
Because of this, people following a vegetarian or  vegan diet should take supplements  or eat plenty of the fruits and vegetables listed above.
Fortunately, foods abundant in vitamin A are usually easy to come by, and most are an excellent addition to  a healthy diet .
The  symptoms of vitamin A deficiency  include hair loss, skin problems, dry eyes, night blindness, and increased susceptibility to infections.

Takeaway
Vitamin A is a critical fat-soluble vitamin that helps maintain vision, body growth, immune function, and reproductive health. Eating enough foods containing vitamin A can help prevent deficiency.
Good sources of vitamin A include vegetables such as carrots and squash, fruits like apricots and watermelon, as well as animal products like beef, chicken, clams, and butter.
