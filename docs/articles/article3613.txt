Title: 12 of the Most Nutrient-Dense Foods You Can Eat

Nutrient-dense foods include beneficial micro- and macronutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, protein, fiber, and healthy fats, like omega-3 fatty acids.
You can support your overall health by choosing foods with the greatest amount and variety of nutrients. No single food provides all the nutrients you need, so a varied diet is more nutritious.
First, you’ll need to limit or avoid highly processed foods with many calories but little nutritional value. Some of them even increase inflammation and negatively affect your health.
Then, start adding nutritious foods to your eating plan. The foods in this list contain beneficial nutrients that may:
help reduce inflammation
reduce oxidative stress and cellular damage that can contribute to cancer and other diseases
help regulate the body’s essential functions like digestion
support healthy organ function
lower your risk of or help manage diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and dementia
Keep reading to learn which foods are most nutritious and how they support your health.

1. Salmon
Oily fish, such as salmon, is high in  omega-3 fatty acids . These are essential nutrients, which means you can only get them from foods. Every cell in your body needs omega-3 fatty acids. They  are necessary for  the correct functioning of your:
brain
eyes
heart
blood vessels
lungs
immune system
endocrine system
A 100-gram serving of wild Atlantic salmon contains about  2.2 grams (g)  of omega-3s and 25.4 g of high quality animal protein. It also provides vitamins and minerals, including magnesium, potassium, selenium, and B vitamins.
Salmon  tastes good and is fairly simple to prepare. It also tends to make you feel full with relatively few calories.
When buying fish, always check it comes from a  sustainable source .

2. Sardines
Sardines are small, oily fish that you can eat whole, including the organs, bones, and other nutritious parts. They  contain  a little of almost every nutrient your body needs.
Like other fatty fish, they’re also high in  heart-healthy  omega-3 fatty acids.
Plus, they’re low in  mercury  compared to larger fish.

3. Kale
Kale  is a green, leafy vegetable rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants, and various bioactive compounds. Brassicas like kale and cabbage  also contain  cancer-fighting compounds.
It provides vitamins C, A, K, and B6, potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper, and manganese. A one-cup serving has only  9 calories .

4. Seaweed
There are many types of  seaweed  and ways to use it in food. Nori, for instance, is used to wrap sushi.
Seaweed  provides  minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium, and manganese.
It is also high in  iodine , a mineral your body uses to  make thyroid hormones .
Some  test tube and animal studies  suggest that polysaccharides and other nutrients in seaweed may also have antioxidant properties. This means they could help protect against oxidative stress, which contributes to inflammation and other health issues.

5. Garlic
Garlic  is both tasty and healthy. It’s highly nutritious and contains bioactive compounds that have confirmed disease-fighting properties.
Garlic  provides :
vitamins C
B1,
B6
calcium
potassium
copper
manganese
selenium
allicin, a sulfur compound
While more research is needed,  some evidence  suggests allicin and garlic may help reduce the risk of heart disease by:
lowering blood pressure
reducing total and LDL (bad) cholesterol
raising HDL (good) cholesterol
A high intake of vegetables from the garlic family has also been linked to a  lower risk  of gastrointestinal cancer.

6. Shellfish
Clams, oysters, scallops, and mussels are types of shellfish that can be highly nutritious. They’re very high in important nutrients like vitamin B12 and zinc.
Clams are a  good source  of B vitamins, particularly  vitamin B12 . They also provide vitamin C, potassium, selenium, and iron.
As with other fish, be sure to obtain  sustainable  and  safe  shellfish, as some seafood can contain mercury and other toxins.

7. Potatoes
Potatoes  are  good sources  of potassium, magnesium, iron, copper, and manganese. They also contain vitamin C and most B vitamins. If you eat them with their peels, they provide a good source of fiber.
A  2021 study  of data for adolescents in the United States found that those who eat potatoes are more likely to have higher levels of essential nutrients, such as B vitamins, fiber, protein, and a range of minerals, than those who don’t. However, there could be various reasons for this.
Potatoes are a high-satiety food and provide resistant starch, making them satisfying and filling. Some  research  suggests they may be more filling than other high carb foods, such as rice or pasta. This can help people manage their weight, as they are less likely to snack after eating potatoes.

8. Liver
One function of the  liver  is to store important nutrients for the rest of the body. As a food, this makes animal liver highly nutritious.
A  3.5-ounce  (100-gram) portion of beef liver contains significant amounts of:
vitamin B12
vitamin B5, vitamin B6, niacin, and folate
vitamin B2
vitamin A
copper
iron, phosphorus, zinc, and selenium
high quality animal protein
Eating liver once per week is a good way to ensure that you get optimal amounts of these vital nutrients.

9. Berries
Many berries provide an excellent source of antioxidants.
Blueberries, for instance, contain  anthocyanins  and other  polyphenols . Some  research  suggests these compounds can cross the blood-brain barrier and have a neuroprotective function.
The possible  health effects of blueberries  include:
improvements  in thinking and mood
enhancing endothelial function, essential for healthy blood flow, such as in this  study  of postmenopausal people with low estrogen and high blood pressure
inhibit  the growth of cancer cells
However, more research is needed to confirm these findings.

10. Eggs
Whole eggs  are so nutritious that they’re sometimes called “nature’s multivitamin.” The yolk contains most of the nutrients.
Eggs  provide  high quality protein and healthy fats and are a satisfying food. Their high satiety value means you are less likely to be hungry soon after eating. Because of this, eating eggs for breakfast  may help  with weight loss.
Egg yolks contain vitamins, minerals, and various powerful nutrients, including  choline . They’re also high in lutein and zeaxanthin, antioxidants that can  protect your eyes  and reduce your risk of eye diseases like cataracts and macular degeneration.
They are also cheap, flavorful, and easy to prepare.

11. Bitter melon
Momordica charantia, also known as  bitter melon  or bitter gourd, is a cucumber-shaped vegetable with antioxidant properties.
It is commonly grown across parts of Asia, South America, and Africa and has long  been  a traditional medicine or medicinal food in some regions.
Research suggests the nutrients it contains may:
help manage  blood sugar levels in people with diabetes
protect the brain and improve memory in people with Alzheimer’s disease
have  anticancer properties
One  130-g cup  of cooked bitter melon contains 53 calories and also provides:
fiber
calcium
magnesium
potassium
B vitamins
vitamins K, C, and A
You can try it in the following recipes:
Bitter melon stir fry
Bitter melon with eggs
Bitter melon namul

12. Cocoa and dark chocolate
Cocoa powder  contains  iron, magnesium, copper, manganese, and antioxidants. A cup of cocoa with milk but no added sugar can make a nutritious treat.
Some studies have suggested that eating  dark chocolate  with a  70 to 85%  cocoa content may reduce the risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart disease.
However, the nutrients you can get from eating a reasonable amount of chocolate are unlikely to have significant health benefits.
The  American Heart Association  recommends eating a little chocolate for enjoyment but not necessarily for its health benefits.

Frequently asked questions
No single food can provide all the nutrients you need. Still, potatoes are high in nutrients and relatively easy to produce in many places, making them the  most important  non-cereal staple crop worldwide and essential for food security in many places.
However, fried potatoes and potato chips  may be detrimental  to health due to added fat and factors related to processing. Baked potatoes in their peels are likely the healthiest option.
Other nutrient-dense options include whole eggs and fatty fish.
It is not possible to identify a single healthiest food, but the healthiest diet contains a variety of fresh, plant-based foods, lean protein, and a range of nutrients.
Oily fish, eggs, avocados, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables are some of the most nutritious foods.
However, no food provides all the nutrients we need, so it’s essential to have a varied diet that includes plenty of fresh ingredients and is as little processed as possible.
The more processed a food is, the more likely nutrients are to be destroyed and unwanted nutrients, such as sugar or  additives , to be added.
It is unlikely that a person could survive for long on a single food source. Still, the choice would depend on many factors, such as where you lived, access to cooking facilities, water content (if you didn’t have access to water), and the availability of the food.
Dates are high in antioxidants, minerals, and other nutrients. They provide energy and can help sustain life in harsh desert conditions. Some  research  suggests they may have health benefits. However, they do not provide the protein or other nutrition you need in the long term.
People have also used potatoes as a survival food, but eating only potatoes would likely have a negative effect on your health.

The bottom line
Nutrient-dense foods are rich in nutrients relative to their calorie content. These include various foods such as whole vegetables, fruits, cocoa, seafood, eggs, and liver.
Adding these foods to your diet can make it more nutritious.
Typically, however, the best diet will always contain as wide a variety of fresh foods as you can obtain and afford, as no single food can provide all the nutrients your body needs.
