Title: 10 Keto Salad Dressings to Spice up Your Low-Carb Lifestyle



The ketogenic, or keto, diet is a very-low-carb, high-fat diet that has been shown to deliver several health benefits ( 1 ).
While this way of eating can be inherently limiting, advancements in food science and culinary creativity have made this diet much easier to follow.
Non-starchy vegetables like salad greens are low in carbs and a terrific option if you’re following a keto diet. Still, it can be tricky to find a tasty, low-carb salad dressing that goes beyond plain oil and vinegar.
Here are 10 keto-friendly salad dressings, all with 4 grams of carbs per serving or less.

1. Homestyle ranch

1/4 cup (60 ml) of heavy whipping cream
1 tsp of chopped chives

1 tsp of onion powder
1 tsp of garlic powder
1–2 tsp (5–10ml) of fresh lemon juice
Salt and pepper to taste

Unsuitable dressings for a keto diet and buying tips
While many salad dressings are keto friendly due to their fat-to-carb ratio, some don’t fit this profile — generally because they pack  added sugar  or make up for a lack of fat by adding carbs. Unsuitable dressings including:
French dressing
fat-free salad dressing
traditional honey-mustard dressing
Catalina dressing
pre-bottled vinaigrettes
While homemade keto salad dressings taste fresher, many great store-bought varieties are available as well.
When shopping for keto salad dressing, pay attention to the following:
The first ingredient should be a type of fat, such as olive, avocado, or MCT oil.
The ingredients should be as close to nature as possible, such as herbs, spices, lemon juice, and vinegar.
Watch out for added sugars.

The bottom line
The very-low-carb, high-fat keto diet has gained popularity in recent years.
While this way of eating can be rather restrictive, creative recipes can provide the flavors of old high-carb favorites with minimal carbs, making boring salads a thing of the past.
Most of the above recipes can be kept in the refrigerator for seven or more days, giving you an array of dressings to choose from.
With mostly whole-food ingredients and a good dose of fat, these dressings are sure to add life to your  keto diet .
