Often characterized by symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain, gas, and bloating,  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)  is one of the most commonly diagnosed digestive disorders.
It can also be difficult to manage symptoms, and treatment typically involves making modifications to your diet and lifestyle.
Some research  suggests that probiotics — a type of beneficial bacteria found in the digestive tract — could help alleviate symptoms of IBS and promote regularity.
However, with so many supplements to choose from, figuring out which probiotic is right for you can be challenging.
Our editors and dietitians reviewed the best probiotics on the market to determine which ones are worth considering for people with IBS.

Vetting:  All the products included were vetted to ensure they meet Healthline’s medical and business  standards .

Seed DS-01 stands out for including non-fermenting prebiotics that are compatible with a low  FODMAP diet , which is commonly followed by individuals with IBS.

Each 2-capsule serving contains 24 different probiotic strains, including  Lactiplantibacillus plantarum  and  Bifidobacterium lactis , both of which may help improve stool consistency in people with diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D).

Seed is a subscription-based company that prioritizes sustainability by sending customers refillable glass jars.

The company’s products undergo extensive testing throughout the manufacturing process and on final products to ensure purity and potency.

One important note: Seed DS-01 uses  AFU  (active fluorescent units), instead of CFU, to measure the number of viable probiotic cells per dose.
Research  suggests that because AFU is able to measure all viable cells, including those that may not be culturable, AFU is a more accurate measure than CFU.

“Upon receiving my DS-01 Daily Symbiotic 30-day sample from Seed, I was immediately impressed with the care that went into the packaging — all biodegradable — and that the supplements come in a refillable dark glass container, to protect them from light.
“The composition of the supplement was clearly explained: The ‘prebiotic’ part actually makes up the outer shell of the capsule, while the probiotic itself comes in a smaller capsule.”
— Kelle Walsh, Healthline editor

A comparison of the best probiotic supplements for IBS

How to choose a probiotic supplement for IBS
There are several factors to consider when shopping for a  probiotic for IBS , including:
CFU count:  The term colony forming units (CFUs) refers to the amount of live bacteria that a supplement contains. Most probiotics contain at least 1–10 billion CFUs per serving, but some may have more.
Composition:  Look for a probiotic containing strains of bacteria that have been  studied specifically  for IBS, such as Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium infantis.
Intended use:  Some probiotics may be better suited for specific  types of IBS , such as IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), IBS with constipation (IBS-C), or IBS with mixed bowel habits (IBS-M).
Storage needs:  While most probiotics are shelf-stable, some strains are more sensitive to heat and moisture and may require refrigeration.
Quality testing:  Because dietary supplements aren’t regulated by the FDA the same way that medications are, it’s important to choose probiotic supplements that are tested, ideally by a third-party lab, to make sure the contents match the label.
When considering a probiotic supplement, it’s important to keep in mind that everyone’s microbiome is different. Because of this, it may require a bit of trial and error to find a supplement that fits your needs.
It’s also worth noting that probiotic supplements aren’t necessary or appropriate for everyone.
Before adding a probiotic supplement to your wellness regimen, it’s best to talk with a trusted healthcare professional, like a registered dietitian, who can make recommendations based on your symptoms, diet, and medical history.

Frequently asked questions
Probiotic supplements may be beneficial for  managing IBS , as they help balance gut bacteria and may reduce symptoms like bloating, gas, and irregular bowel movements. However, individual needs can vary, so it’s important to consult a healthcare professional to determine if a probiotic, and which strain, is right for you.
