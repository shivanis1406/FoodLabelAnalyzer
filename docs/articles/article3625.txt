Title: How to Get Rybelsus In Person and Online

Rybelsus is a prescription-only medication approved for type 2 diabetes management. In some cases, it can be prescribed off-label to support weight loss. Learn how to get Rybelsus in person or online.
Rybelsus (semaglutide) is a medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for type 2 diabetes management. It may sometimes be used to support weight loss in people with overweight or obesity.
It works by mimicking the actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a hormone that’s critical for blood sugar regulation. It also slows digestion and reduces hunger, which could lead to weight loss.
Unlike other GLP-1 medications, which are injections,  Rybelsus  is a daily oral tablet, making it a more accessible option for many.
However, you’ll need a prescription from a licensed medical professional to get Rybelsus. This could be your primary care professional, endocrinologist, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant.
This article looks at how to get Rybelsus and who’s eligible for a prescription.

Your healthcare professional will consider numerous factors when determining whether Rybelsus is right for you.
However, Janelle Duah, MD, assistant professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine, explained to Healthline that Rybelsus could be a good option if you’re afraid of needles or are unable to safely inject yourself.
According to Duah, “Dexterity and vision can also play a role in a person’s comfort with using a pen, and people with issues in those realms may want to opt to take a pill.”
Alternatively, Duah noted, “If the patient already suffers from GI issues like nausea, heartburn, diarrhea, or constipation, [licensed physicians] would [consider] injected Victoza or Ozempic over oral Rybelsus as the oral formulation has a higher risk of side effects.”

How does Rybelsus work?
Semaglutide , the active ingredient in Rybelsus, is a  glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist  that acts like GLP-1 in the body. When you take Rybelsus, it binds to the GLP-1 receptors on the surface of pancreatic beta cells. This triggers the cells to release more insulin into the bloodstream, lowering blood sugar.
It also slows digestion and helps you feel full, which may encourage weight loss.

Who qualifies for Rybelsus?
The  FDA approved Rybelsus  to improve blood sugar management in adults with  type 2 diabetes , alongside diet and exercise. People with type 2 diabetes may qualify for Rybelsus if a healthcare professional deems it suitable for a person’s overall diabetes management plan.
However, if your healthcare professional determines it’s safe and medically appropriate, they may prescribe Rybelsus off-label for weight management. Using  GLP-1 medications  for weight loss is typically reserved for people with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 and over, or a BMI of 27 or more with at least one weight-related issue.
Whether you qualify may depend on your overall health, including your current blood sugar control, medical history, and any existing health conditions.

Who should not take Rybelsus?
While Rybelsus is an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes, it’s not suitable for everyone. Having certain health conditions may mean you shouldn’t take Rybelsus.
Rybelsus  carries a  boxed warning  about the risk of  thyroid cancer . This is the most serious alert from the FDA. If you have a personal or family history of thyroid cancer or an endocrine system condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2), your healthcare professional may recommend alternative diabetes treatments to mitigate this risk.
Furthermore, Rybelsus may not be right for you if you have:
diabetic eye problem ( diabetic retinopathy )
risk of low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia )
kidney issues
pancreas issues ( pancreatitis )
allergic reactions to Rybelsus or any of its components
Rybelsus hasn’t been  studied  in pregnant people. So, experts don’t know if it’s harmful to take during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. If you’re pregnant or planning a pregnancy, talk with your healthcare professional about managing your blood sugar levels to find your best management options.

How much does a 30-day supply of Rybelsus cost?
Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Rybelsus, lists the price for a 30-tablet supply of Rybelsus as  $968.52 . This price applies to tablets of all strengths, which includes 3 milligrams (mg), 7 mg, and 14 mg.
However, the price you’ll pay varies based on several factors. Your insurance coverage, location, and choice of filling pharmacy can significantly affect the cost. Likewise, you may be eligible for patient assistance programs, manufacturer discounts, or coupons that could offset costs.
The extent of insurance coverage for Rybelsus varies depending on your specific health insurance plan. Your out-of-pocket expenses for Rybelsus can vary significantly. Some insurance plans may cover a significant portion of the cost, while others may require higher copayments or deductibles.
Your coverage may also depend on the healthcare professional’s assessment of medical necessity. If your doctor determines that Rybelsus is essential for your type 2 diabetes management, your insurance plan may be more likely to cover it.
For the full picture of your  out-of-pocket expenses , it’s best to chat with your insurance provider about Rybelsus coverage.
Novo Nordisk provides a  savings card program . Eligible people may pay as little as $10 for a 1-month, 2-month, or 3-month prescription for Rybelsus with insurance.
You may also find discount coupons at certain pharmacies through websites like GoodRx.

There isn’t an over-the-counter (OTC) version of Rybelsus. However, some OTC supplements may have effects on blood sugar. Research  suggests that  berberine  has significant blood-sugar-lowering effects. This natural bioactive compound is extracted from various plants and appears to increase  insulin sensitivity  and production and help regulate metabolism. It may also help with weight management. A  2020 review  of 12 studies examined the effect of berberine on obesity parameters, inflammation, and liver function enzymes. It found a significant reduction in body weight, waist circumference, and inflammatory markers. It didn’t affect liver enzymes.  If you’re considering trying berberine, it’s best to consult a healthcare professional first to confirm it’s suitable.
