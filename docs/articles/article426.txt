Title: 8 Vegan Drinks at Starbucks

If Starbucks is a part of your regular routine, you may wonder how many items on the company’s extensive drink menu can fit a vegan diet.
While several items are vegan from the start, you can also make slight adjustments to most other drinks to make them vegan-friendly.
Here are 8 drinks at Starbucks that are either already vegan or can be customized to make them vegan.

1. Plain-brewed coffees and teas
Starbucks coffee, as well as its black, green, chai, and herbal teas, are vegan to begin with, so starting with these as your base order is an easy way to avoid animal-derived ingredients.
If you don’t want to drink your coffee black or your tea plain, choose a  nondairy milk  like soy, oat, coconut, or almond milk.
You can also add certain flavoring syrups. Note that most of the clear syrups, such as vanilla, hazelnut, and Irish crème, are vegan. Thicker cream syrups like white mocha, pistachio, and  pumpkin spice  contain dairy — though mocha sauce doesn’t.
A tall (12-ounce or 350-mL) blonde roast coffee with sugar-free vanilla syrup provides the following nutrients ( 1 ):
Calories:  5
Fat:  0 grams
Protein:  0 grams
Carbs:  0 grams
Fiber:  0 gram
Order a plain brewed coffee or hot tea. You can also add nondairy milk or a clear flavoring syrup.

2. Matcha Green Tea Latte
This creamy drink is made with milk and a green  matcha tea  blend. It can be made vegan when ordered with soy, oat, coconut, or almond milk.
A tall (12-ounce or 350-mL) Matcha Green Tea Latte made with  soy milk  instead of 2% milk has the following nutrient profile ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ):
Calories:  170
Fat:  3 grams
Protein:  9 grams
Carbs:  25 grams
Fiber:  2 grams
Make a Matcha Green Tea Latte vegan by substituting soy, oat, coconut, or almond milk for dairy milk.

3. Mocha Frappuccino Blended Beverage
This cold blend of mocha sauce, coffee, milk, and ice is usually topped with whipped cream.
Ordered with soy, oat, coconut, or almond milk and without  whipped cream , this drink can be made vegan. The mocha sauce is already vegan, unlike most of Starbucks’ other thick syrups.
A tall (12-ounce or 350-mL) Mocha Frappuccino Blended Beverage made with  oat milk  instead of 2% milk and without whipped cream, provides the following ( 3 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ):
Calories:  170
Fat:  3 grams
Protein:  1 gram
Carbs:  38 grams
Fiber:  1 gram
To make a vegan Mocha Frappuccino, order it with nondairy milk and ask for no whip.

4. Nitro Cold Brew
Many people like the Nitro Cold Brew because it’s simply plain brewed coffee that’s made sweeter and creamier by  infusion with nitrogen  — no milk or sugar necessary.
A tall (12-ounce or 350-mL) Nitro Cold Brew has the following nutrient profile ( 8 ):
Calories:  5
Fat:  0 grams
Protein:  0 grams
Carbs:  0 grams
Fiber:  0 gram
The Nitro Cold Brew is vegan on its own. It’s simply a plain brewed coffee with nitrogen added to it.

5. Caffè Americano
Whether you order this drink iced or hot, it’s vegan since it’s made only of espresso and water.
You can add a clear flavoring syrup, such as vanilla, hazelnut, or Irish crème, or a nondairy milk for creamer.
A tall (12-ounce or 350-mL) Caffè Americano ordered plain provides ( 9 ):
Calories:  10
Fat:  0 grams
Protein:  1 gram
Carbs:  1 gram
Fiber:  0 gram
The Caffè Americano is naturally vegan since it uses only hot water and espresso. As with plain brewed coffee, you can add nondairy milk or a clear flavoring syrup.

6. Flat White
A flat white is made with steamed  whole milk  and ristretto espresso shots, which mean only the first portion of the full espresso shot is pulled to make the end result more concentrated. This drink can be ordered hot or cold.
When made with soy, oat,  coconut , or almond milk instead of whole milk, it’s fully vegan.
A tall (12-ounce or 350-mL) Flat White ordered with soy milk instead of 2% milk contains the following nutrients ( 3 ,  4 ,  10 ):
Calories:  165
Fat:  8.5 grams
Protein:  9 grams
Carbs:  14 grams
Fiber:  0 gram
To make a Flat White vegan, you need only to swap whole milk for nondairy milk.

7. Iced London Fog Tea Latte
This tea latte is made with two  Earl Grey  tea bags, vanilla syrup, milk, and ice.
Ask for oat,  almond , soy, or coconut milk in place of the dairy milk to make this drink vegan.
A tall (12-ounce or 350-mL) Iced London Fog Tea Latte made with almond milk instead of 2% milk provides the following ( 3 ,  11 ,  12 ):
Calories:  50
Fat:  1 gram
Protein:  1 gram
Carbs:  20 grams
Fiber:  1 gram
Make the Iced London Fog Tea Latte vegan by asking for nondairy milk instead of dairy milk.

8. Pink Drink
The Pink Drink gets its name from the pink color made from its strawberry and  acai  base, plus dried strawberries. The standard order for this drink uses coconut milk, so no other substitutions are needed to make it vegan.
A tall (12-ounce or 350-mL) Pink Drink has the following nutrient profile ( 13 ):
Calories:  110
Fat:  2 grams
Protein:  0 grams
Carbs:  21 grams
Fiber:  1 gram
The Pink Drink is vegan from the start, as it uses coconut milk and fruit for its signature sweet, popping flavor.

The bottom line
Starbucks has an extensive drink menu that includes many  vegan  options.
Plus, numerous other  Starbucks drinks  can be made vegan by requesting a few simple substitutions, such as holding the whipped cream or swapping cow’s milk for nondairy milk.
Keep in mind that Starbucks offers almond, coconut, soy, and oat milks for any beverage. The company also has several clear flavoring syrups that don’t contain animal-derived ingredients.
