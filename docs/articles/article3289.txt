Title: 8 Evidence-Based Health Benefits of Quinoa

Quinoa is gluten-free and packed with nutrients like protein, zinc, fiber, folate, and antioxidants. Quinoa doesn’t take long to prepare, and you can add it to your diet in both sweet and savory dishes.
Quinoa has gained popularity as a health food in the United States and other Westernized countries, though people have cultivated it in South America since ancient times.
Hundreds of years ago, the Inca people considered this ancient grain a sacred food.
In the past couple of decades, quinoa’s popularity has grown exponentially as the demand for easy-to-grow, nutritious, gluten-free grain alternatives has soared.
Not only is quinoa nutrient-dense, but it may offer health benefits, too.
This article covers eight health benefits of quinoa and tips on incorporating it into your diet.

Packed with nutrients
Quinoa is a grain crop grown for its edible seeds. These seeds are what we call quinoa — pronounced KEEN-wah.
Although it’s usually grouped with cereal grains like oats and barley, quinoa is  actually  a pseudocereal grain.
Pseudocereal grains are seeds that are prepared and eaten similarly to grains. Examples include  buckwheat  and  amaranth .
Different types of quinoa include:
red
black
white
Here is the nutrient breakdown for  1 cup  (185 grams) of cooked quinoa:
Calories:  222
Protein:  8 grams
Fat:  3.55 grams
Carbohydrates:  39 grams
Fiber:  5 grams
Folate:  19% of the daily value (DV)
Vitamin B6:  13% of the DV
Vitamin E:  8% of the DV
Copper:  39% of the DV
Iron:  15% of the DV
Zinc:  18% of the DV
Manganese:  51% of the DV
Magnesium:  28% of the DV
Potassium:  7% of the DV
Phosphorus:  22% of the DV
Quinoa  is a good source of several important nutrients, including:
folate
magnesium
zinc
iron
It also contains  fiber  and protein, nutrients that help you feel satisfied after eating.

Quinoa contains antioxidant and anti-inflammatory plant compounds
Quinoa contains several plant compounds that may benefit health in several ways.
Quercetin and kaempferol are two flavonoid plant compounds that have been particularly well studied. These are the  main flavonoids  found in quinoa.
Quercetin and kaempferol have anti-inflammatory qualities and act as  antioxidants  in the body, meaning they help protect cells from damage caused by unstable molecules called free radicals.
Consuming more flavonoid-rich foods like quinoa  may help promote  overall health and protect against certain diseases and overall mortality.
You can significantly increase your total intake of these and other antioxidant compounds by including nutritious foods like quinoa in your diet.

Higher in fiber than many grains
Another important benefit of quinoa is its high fiber content.
A 1-cup (185-gram) serving of cooked quinoa contains 5.18 grams of fiber. That’s about 18% of the current 28-gram DV.
Quinoa contains more fiber than several other popular grains, like  brown rice .
A 1-cup (195-gram) serving of cooked brown rice contains  3.51 grams  of fiber, 1.67 grams less than the same serving size of quinoa.
Adding fiber-rich foods like quinoa into your diet  can help support  your digestive health by promoting regular bowel movements and fueling  beneficial bacteria  in your gut.
Eating a high fiber diet  can help  you maintain a moderate body weight. Fiber helps promote feelings of fullness. Pairing high fiber foods like quinoa with  high protein foods  can help you feel satisfied after meals and may help you eat a healthful portion size.

Quinoa is naturally gluten-free
Some people with gluten intolerance, including those with celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity, need to avoid foods containing gluten.
People following a gluten-free diet must choose  gluten-free alternatives  to gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.
Quinoa is  naturally gluten-free  and makes a nutritious choice for people who want or need to cut gluten from their diet. However, be sure to check the package label to ensure the product is free from cross-contamination.
Unlike gluten-free products made with refined ingredients, quinoa provides a good source of nutrients that gluten-free diets  often lack , like:
fiber
folate
zinc
magnesium

Provides protein
Compared to other grains, quinoa is a good source of  protein , providing  8 grams  per cooked cup (185 grams). It can help contribute to your daily protein intake.
Quinoa is often referred to as a complete protein. This is because it contains all nine essential amino acids that your body can’t make on its own.
However, some  experts  argue that quinoa should not be considered a complete protein because it contains low amounts of certain amino acids, like leucine and lysine. For this reason, some consider it a “nearly complete” protein rather than a complete protein. To get all the essential amino acids, experts recommend consuming various protein-containing foods throughout the day.
Either way, quinoa is a good source of protein — and incorporating quinoa into your diet can help you meet your daily protein needs.
This is especially true for those who follow plant-based diets, like a  vegan diet . Combining quinoa with beans, tofu, and mixed vegetables quickly makes a plant-based, protein-rich meal.

Contains essential vitamins and minerals
Quinoa is high in fiber and contains several vitamins and minerals that are often lacking in many people’s diets.
Studies  show that many children and adults don’t consume enough vitamins and minerals, including folate, potassium, iron, and magnesium.
An  estimated  90% of American females and 97% of American males don’t consume the recommended amount of fiber. Not getting enough fiber can affect your health, including by increasing your risk of chronic diseases.
Quinoa contains magnesium, potassium, iron, fiber, and  folate . Folate is a vitamin that’s  especially important  during pregnancy due to its role in fetal growth and development. Eating quinoa as part of a nutritious diet may help you reach these recommended levels.
It’s important to note that quinoa  contains  some  antinutrients , including:
saponins
tannins
phytic acid
These can bind with certain nutrients like iron and magnesium, reducing their absorption.
However, rinsing, soaking, or sprouting the quinoa before cooking  can reduce  the antinutrient content and make these minerals more bioavailable.
According to a  2022 review , quinoa is also pretty high in  oxalates . Oxalates can potentially contribute to recurring kidney stones.

May benefit cardiometabolic health
Some studies suggest that eating quinoa could benefit certain aspects of your metabolic and cardiovascular health.
A  2020 study  in 40 older adults had participants eat 0.5 ounces (15 grams) of quinoa flour biscuits daily for 28 days.
By the end of the study, the participants who ate the quinoa biscuits had significantly greater reductions in LDL (bad) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and body weight than those who ate wheat-based biscuits.
Additional  research  suggests eating quinoa and quinoa-based products may benefit:
blood sugar regulation
body weight
triglyceride levels
A  2017 study  included 50 people with excess weight or obesity and had participants consume 1.8 ounces (50 grams) of quinoa daily for 12 weeks.
Compared with the control group and a group that consumed 0.88 ounces (25 grams) of quinoa daily, the 1.8-ounce quinoa group had significantly reduced triglyceride levels.
While these results suggest quinoa positively affects cardiometabolic health, your overall diet and lifestyle matter most when it comes to decreasing your risk of disease.
Following a dietary pattern  rich in nutritious foods  like quinoa, vegetables, fruits, fish, and beans is a smart way to protect your health and reduce disease risk factors, such as high blood lipid and high blood sugar levels.

Easy to incorporate into your diet
Quinoa is easy to incorporate into your diet, which can make adding it to an eating plan more sustainable in the long term.
Quinoa is also tasty and goes well with many foods.
Depending on the type of quinoa, you may need to rinse it with water before you cook it to get rid of saponins. These are found naturally on the outer layer and can taste bitter.
However, some brands sell quinoa pre-rinsed, making this step unnecessary. You can also purchase  sprouted quinoa , which has a  reduced  antinutrient content and can  help improv e nutrient absorption.
You can buy quinoa in most health food stores and many supermarkets.

How to cook quinoa
Quinoa can be ready to eat in as little as 15–20 minutes. To cook it:
Rinse 1 cup (170 grams) quinoa thoroughly using a fine mesh strainer.
Put 2 cups (240 mL) water in a pot and turn the heat to high.
Add rinsed quinoa with a dash of salt.
Boil 15–20 minutes.
Enjoy.
It should now have absorbed most of the water and gotten a fluffy look. If done right, it should have a mild, nutty flavor and a satisfying crunch.
You can easily find many diverse recipes for quinoa online, including breakfast bowls, lunches, and dinners.
You can use quinoa in both sweet and savory recipes.
For example, you can make a savory  quinoa and vegetable salad  topped with feta and grilled chicken. Or make a sweet  breakfast porridge with cooked quinoa , coconut milk, fresh fruit, walnuts, cinnamon, and a drizzle of honey.

The bottom line
Quinoa is technically a seed and is considered part of a small group of grains called pseudocereals, along with amaranth and buckwheat.
It’s a smart carbohydrate choice because it contains fiber, minerals, antioxidants, and protein. It’s also gluten-free, delicious, versatile, and easy to prepare.
