Title: It’s Time to Leave Juice Cleanses Behind — Here’s Why

Juice cleanses are a type of short-term detox diet. They consist of only drinking juices from fruits and vegetables. However, there are risks associated with juice cleanses.
According to the  National Center for Complimentary and Integrative Health (NCCHI) , people use juice diets to:
lose weight
clear toxins from their body
improve their skin condition
However, very little research supports these benefits. There may even be risks associated with juice cleansing.
Keep reading to learn more about juice cleanses, their potential benefits and downsides, and alternative ways to help support your health.

What are the benefits of juice cleanses?
The authors of a 2020 review suggest that  ultra-processed foods  make up to  60%  of the average American diet. These foods have been associated with a number of medical conditions,  such as :
heart disease
higher body weight
cancer
type 2 diabetes
irritable bowel syndrome
depression
Ultra-processed foods contain high amounts of  added sugar ,  unhealthy fats , and  refined carbohydrates . They’re high in calories but provide very little nutrients.
On the other hand,  juice cleanses  are low in calories and provide a range of  nutrients ,  vitamins , and  phytonutrients .
Let’s look at some of the potential health benefits of juice cleanses.
Fruits  and  vegetables  are high in various active compounds that benefit general health and help prevent chronic conditions.
For example, they’re a good source of  phenolic compounds . These  have  antioxidant, immune-supporting, and antibacterial properties. Fruit juices may  also help lower  blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
Juice cleanses may help increase the number of  healthy bacteria  in your gut, which has been linked to weight loss.
In a  2017 study , a 3-day juice-only diet altered the gut bacteria in 20 healthy adult participants. They experienced substantial weight losses that lasted after the study ended. The researchers concluded this may be due to changes in the participants’ gut bacteria.
However, it’s important to note that the participants only consumed 1,310 calories per day. This is below the  number of daily calories  recommended by the “ Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020–2025 ” for weight maintenance, which is at least 1,600 calories for adult females and 2,000 for adult males.
As such, being in a calorie deficit could lead to rapid weight loss.
There is a lack of scientific evidence to support the idea that juices  cleanse your body by flushing toxins .
Some detox treatments have been shown to improve liver detoxification and remove environmental pollutants from the body. However, the authors of a  2015 review  suggest that these clinical studies have significant flaws in methodology and low participant numbers.
Much of the promoted evidence also comes from animal research, which can’t necessarily be applied to humans.
A  2016 study  suggests that  citrus -based juices might help preserve skin health by reducing  oxidative stress . Similarly,  pomegranate  juice has been shown to  help prevent  signs of skin aging.
However, these are both animal studies. More studies with humans are needed before any conclusions can be drawn.

What are the risks of juice cleanses?
Most people who do juice cleanses don’t eat enough solid food to meet their energy needs. This may lead to  increased hunger  and  energy restrictions  that could cause  symptoms  like:
tiredness
headaches
irritability
Juices  also have less dietary fiber than whole fruits and vegetables. Some  research  suggests that less fiber facilitates your body to process and absorb the juice’s nutrients.
However,  dietary fiber  also has many health benefits. It  promotes  blood sugar management, heart health, and gut health and is associated with a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer.
Many store-bought juices are also  high in added sugar , which has been  associated  with:
weight gain
obesity
diabetes
tooth decay
Juice cleanses have been shown to impact people’s  relationship with food .
For example, an obsessive preoccupation with health-promoting foods and an avoidance of foods considered “less healthy”  can lead  to  orthorexia nervosa .
Fruit juices have also been  associated  with  bulimia nervosa .
Speak with a close friend, family member, or healthcare professional if you find yourself caught in a food-related loop. This may include:
being preoccupied with food or your body size
feeling guilty about your food choices
struggling to stop attempting restrictive diets like juice cleanses
These could be signs of  disordered eating .
Disordered eating and eating disorders can affect anyone, regardless of gender identity, race, age, socioeconomic status, or other identities.
They can be caused by any combination of biological, social, cultural, and environmental factors — not just by exposure to diet culture.
You can also chat, call, or text anonymously with trained volunteers at the  National Eating Disorders Association  helpline for free or explore the organization’s free and low cost resources.

Alternative ways to nourish yourself
Our organs, such as the liver, kidneys, and lungs are typically good at  eliminating harmful compounds  on their own.
That said, here’s a few things you can do to help further support these organ systems in healthy ways:
eat a well-balanced,  anti-inflammatory diet
get  150–300 minutes  of physical activity per week
limit your sugar intake
drink  smoothies  instead of juices
stay hydrated by drinking six to eight  8-ounce (oz)  glasses of water per day
find  nutrient-dense foods  that you enjoy eating
identify triggers that may cause  emotional eating
try  intermittent fasting
practice mindful eating
manage your portion sizes

Frequently asked questions
It’s possible to lose weight on a juice cleanse. However, this is likely to be  water weight , rather than fat. It’s important to note that after a few days of juice cleansing, you may also start to lose muscle mass. Maintaining muscle mass during weight loss is very important for your general health.
This may vary for every individual and will depend on several factors, such as:
how much you weigh
how active you are
how many calories you’re consuming
The authors of a 2017 study found that participants lost up to  1.2kg  after a 3-day juice cleanse.

Takeaway
A nutritious diet filled with whole foods is key for optimal health and disease prevention. Juices can complement your diet, but they shouldn’t replace solid food.
There is a lack of scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of juice cleanses. They’re also not suitable for everyone, and they might lead to an unhealthy relationship with food or to eating disorders.
Speak with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian if you’re concerned about your diet. They can help you develop a plan that’s right for you.
Our culture thrives on quick-fix solutions, and we’re eager to test them out on our health and well-being. Indeed, it’s easy to be persuaded by the promise of a miraculous juice cleanse that will help you lose weight and rid your body of toxins.
But these claims don’t hold true. It’s much more beneficial to learn and practice healthy living habits than it is to try crash diets or juice cleanses.
