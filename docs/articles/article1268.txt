Title: 8 Herbal Teas to Help Reduce Bloating

Several herbal teas have been shown to support digestion, increase regularity, and protect against certain conditions that can contribute to bloating.
If your abdomen sometimes feels swollen and uncomfortable, you’re not alone. Bloating affects around 14% of people in the United States ( 1 ).
Many factors may trigger bloating, including food intolerances, a buildup of gas in your gut, imbalanced intestinal bacteria, ulcers, constipation, and parasitic infections ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
Traditionally, people have used natural remedies, including herbal teas, to relieve bloating. Preliminary studies suggest that several herbal teas may help soothe this uncomfortable condition.
Here are 8 herbal teas to help reduce bloating.

1. Peppermint
In traditional medicine, peppermint ( Mentha piperita ) is widely recognized for helping soothe digestive issues ( 6 ,  7 ).
Older test-tube and animal studies suggest that plant compounds found in peppermint may inhibit the activity of immune cells found in the gut, which can contribute to bloating ( 8 ,  9 ).
Studies also show that peppermint relaxes the gut, which may relieve intestinal spasms — as well as the bloating and pain that can accompany them ( 10 ,  11 ).
Additionally, peppermint oil capsules may alleviate abdominal pain, bloating, and other  digestive symptoms  ( 12 ).
Some studies suggest that flavonoids and oil in peppermint may relieve bloating. Thus, peppermint tea may have similar effects.

2. Lemon balm
Lemon balm ( Melissa officinalis ) tea has a lemony scent and flavor, along with hints of  mint .
Traditionally, lemon balm has been used to relieve mild digestive issues, including bloating and gas ( 13 ).
Additionally, it’s a key ingredient in Iberogast, a supplement for digestion that contains various herbal extracts and may decrease abdominal pain,  constipation , and other digestive symptoms ( 14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 ).
Some animal studies also suggest that lemon balm could ease intestinal spasms and support regularity ( 18 ,  19 ).
However, more research is needed, as lemon balm or its tea hasn’t been tested alone for its effects on digestive issues in humans.
Traditionally, lemon balm tea has been used for bloating, gas, and other digestive issues. However, human studies are needed to confirm its benefits.

3. Wormwood
Wormwood ( Artemisia absinthium ) is a leafy, green herb that makes a bitter tea.
Due to its bitterness, wormwood is sometimes used in digestive bitters, which are supplements that may help support digestion ( 20 ,  21 ).
This herb may also promote the release of digestive juices, which can help optimize digestion and decrease bloating ( 21 ).
Animal and test-tube studies report that wormwood may also kill parasites, which can be a culprit in bloating ( 22 ).
However, wormwood tea itself hasn’t been tested for anti-bloating effects. More research is necessary.
Additionally, keep in mind that wormwood shouldn’t be used during  pregnancy , as some older animal studies suggest that high doses could be harmful ( 23 ).
Wormwood tea may stimulate the release of digestive juices, which may help relieve bloating and digestive issues. That said, human studies are needed.

4. Ginger
Ginger tea has been used for stomach-related ailments since ancient times ( 24 ).
Studies suggest that taking 1–1.5 g of ginger capsules daily in divided doses may  relieve nausea  ( 25 ,  26 ,  27 ).
Additionally, supplements containing ginger and artichoke have been shown to promote the movement of food through the intestinal tract and decrease digestive discomfort ( 28 ,  29 ).
Still, more research is needed on the effectiveness of ginger tea for bloating when used on its own.
Studies suggest that ginger supplements may relieve nausea, bloating, and gas. Ginger tea may offer similar benefits, but human studies are needed.

5. Fennel
The seeds of fennel ( Foeniculum vulgare ) are used to make tea and taste similar to licorice.
Fennel has traditionally been used for digestive disorders, including abdominal pain, bloating, gas, and constipation ( 30 ).
In an older animal study, treatment with fennel extract helped protect against ulcers, which could reduce the risk of bloating ( 4 ,  31 ).
Fennel is also used to treat constipation, which can also contribute to bloating ( 2 ).
Still, human studies of fennel tea alone are needed to confirm its digestive benefits.
Studies suggest that fennel tea may protect against constipation and ulcers, which could ease bloating. Human studies of fennel tea are needed to confirm these effects.

6. Gentian root
Gentian tea is made from the roots of the  Gentiana lutea  plant and may initially taste sweet, but a bitter taste follows.
Traditionally, gentian root has been used in medicinal products and herbal teas formulated to aid bloating, gas, and other digestive issues ( 32 ).
Additionally, gentian contains  bitter  plant compounds that stimulate the release of digestive juices and bile to help break down food, which may relieve bloating ( 33 ,  34 ,  35 ).
Still, the tea hasn’t been tested in humans — and it’s not advised if you have an ulcer, as it can increase stomach acidity. Thus, more high quality, recent research is needed ( 36 ).
Gentian root contains bitter plant compounds that may support good digestion and relieve bloating and gas. Human studies are needed to confirm these benefits.

7. Chamomile
Chamomile ( Matricaria chamomilla ) is a member of the daisy family with small, white flowers ( 37 ).
Some older animal and test-tube studies suggest that chamomile may prevent  Helicobacter pylori  bacterial infections, which are a cause of stomach ulcers and associated with bloating ( 38 ,  39 ).
Chamomile is also one of the herbs in the supplement Iberogast, which has been shown to help decrease abdominal pain and ulcers ( 40 ).
Still, human studies of  chamomile tea  are needed to confirm its digestive benefits.
In traditional medicine, chamomile has been used for indigestion, gas, and nausea. Preliminary studies suggest that the herb may fight ulcers and abdominal pain, but human studies are needed.

8. Angelica root
This tea is made from the roots of the  Angelica archangelica  plant, a member of the  celery family . The herb has a bitter flavor but tastes better when steeped with lemon balm tea.
Angelica root extract is used in Iberogast and other herbal digestive products ( 40 ).
Additionally, older animal and test-tube research notes that angelica root has properties that may help relieve constipation, which is a culprit in bloating ( 41 ,  42 ).
Overall, more human research on this root is needed.
Some sources claim that angelica root shouldn’t be used during pregnancy, as there isn’t enough information on its safety. Therefore, it’s best to talk with a doctor before trying it if you’re pregnant, or if you’re breastfeeding or chestfeeding ( 42 ).
Angelica root contains bitter compounds that may stimulate the release of digestive juices. Human studies are needed to confirm whether its tea has anti-bloating benefits.

The bottom line
Traditional medicine suggests that several  herbal teas  may reduce abdominal bloating and relieve digestive upset.
For example, peppermint, lemon balm, and wormwood are used in digestive products that have shown preliminary benefits against bloating. Still, human studies are needed on individual teas themselves.
That said, herbal tea is a simple, natural remedy you can try for  bloating  and other digestive issues.
