If you’re experiencing unusual vaginal symptoms like itchiness or odor, it may be due to a pH imbalance. This disruption in body chemistry can create an environment for bacterial growth, among other things.
PH balance pills work to restore healthy pH by supporting bacterial balance.
Read on to learn more about pH balance pills, who might benefit from taking them, and for our dietitians’ recommendations of the best options.

Why pH balance pills?
PH balance pills may help balance vaginal pH levels. When your vaginal pH level is off, you may notice an unusual odor, itchiness, and general discomfort, along with yeast or  bacterial vaginosis (BV)  infections. Taking pH balance pills may help maintain good levels of healthy and unhealthy bacteria.
PH balance pills typically contain  probiotics . These are living microorganisms that, when ingested, can provide certain health benefits. Probiotics may help with:
gut and digestive health
lowering inflammation
managing depression and anxiety
immune function
skin health
aging support
Different probiotics affect different parts of the body. Experts have long researched probiotics for vaginal health.
Still, despite years of research, experts say more studies are needed to draw strong relationships between specific  probiotics supplements and vaginal pH .

Do probiotics for pH balance actually work?
The only proven treatments for BV and yeast infections are antibiotic and antifungal treatments. But recurrence is possible because these treatments may have  adverse effects  on Lactobacilli levels in the vagina, throwing off its balance.
Because of that, some  researchers  suggest adding probiotics as a complementary therapy to antibiotics.
In fact, a  2022 review  of 18 studies found that adding 1–3 months of probiotics treatment along with antibiotics may significantly reduce the recurrence rate of BV, compared with taking only antibiotics.
Similarly, a  2020 review  of 30 studies found that taking probiotics alongside antibiotics helped improve the cure rate and reduce the recurrent rate of vaginitis. But researchers noted benefits were highest after 1 month of supplementing, and they seemed to level off after 6 months.
Experts are still  researching  how effective probiotics are for vaginal pH, with promising results so far.
People with a vagina may benefit from probiotics with Lactobacilli if they have BV or a yeast infection.
A  2023 study  of 36 women found that taking a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus CBT LA1, Lactobacillus rhamnosus CBT LR5, and Lactobacillus reuteri CBT LU4 significantly improved vaginal dysbiosis. Vaginal dysbiosis is an imbalance of good and bad bacteria.
Additionally, a  2022 test tube study  suggests that Lactiplantibacillus plantarum P1 could be beneficial in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis caused by Gardnerella vaginalis, a type of bacteria found in the vagina.
Again, while promising, more research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of probiotic supplements for improving vaginal pH.
If you choose to try pH balance pills, be sure to talk with a doctor or other healthcare professional before introducing them to your diet. They can review your medical history and help you decide whether or not it’s a good idea.
You can start with a lower dose of colony forming units (CFUs) and work your way up once your body adjusts to the supplements. The best time to take a probiotic is with a meal or 30 minutes before eating and  2 hours  before or after taking antibiotics. It may take a few weeks to see a difference.
Supplements, including pH balance pills, don’t have Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval or authorization. If you have any doubts about adding a supplement to your diet, talk with a primary care doctor to make sure it’s safe for you to do so.

If you dislike swallowing pills, Lemme Purr Gummies may be worth considering.

The gummies are vegan-friendly and contain B. coagulans, a probiotic strain that may help with recovering from BV.
However, it’s important to note that the  study  on this strain used a dose of 10 billion CFUs, whereas a serving of these gummies only contain 6 billion.

In addition to probiotics, Lemme Purr Gummies also include vitamin C. A  2011 study  found  topical  application of vitamin C to be effective for improving vaginal pH levels. However, it’s unknown whether oral use of vitamin C has a similar effect.

Lemme supplements are third-party tested to ensure purity and potency, though the name of the testing organization isn’t disclosed.

What is vaginal pH?
PH is a measurement of how acidic or alkaline (aka basic) something is. The scale runs from 0–14. The pH balance of your vagina can help determine whether or not it’s at a healthy level.
A healthy vaginal pH level is between 3.8–4.5. However, a healthy pH level will vary based on your age.
During your reproductive years, from ages 15–49, your vaginal pH will typically be at or below 4.5. Before menstruation and after menopause, a healthy pH will be higher than 4.5.
An acidic vagina means that it’s more protective. It creates a barrier that prevents unhealthy bacteria and yeast from multiplying too quickly and causing infection.
Having a  vaginal pH  level above 4.5 puts you at risk of several infections, like BV or  trichomoniasis , sometimes known as trich.
An unbalanced pH level can be caused by:
sex without a condom or other barrier method
antibiotics
douching
menstrual periods
anything that isn’t sanitized and is inserted into the vagina
any product that contains vinegar
