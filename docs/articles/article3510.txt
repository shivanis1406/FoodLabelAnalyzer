Title: 10 Supplements for Women: Do You Need Them (and Which Ones)?

Women have specific nutrient needs that change throughout their life span ( 1 ).
For example, teens have different nutrient needs than postmenopausal women, and pregnant and breastfeeding women need greater amounts of specific nutrients than nonpregnant women.
What’s more, your nutrient needs may differ depending on your overall health and lifestyle.
Although nutrient supplementation isn’t necessary for all women, some may need to take supplements to reach their recommended intake levels.
This article covers nutrient needs for women and lists 10 of the best supplements to support women’s health.

Sex and gender exist on spectrums. This article uses the term “women” to refer to a person’s sex assigned at birth.

Nutrient overview and recommended intakes
Depending on their age and health status, women and teens have differing daily vitamin and mineral needs.
Vitamins are divided into two categories: water-soluble and fat-soluble.
Water-soluble vitamins  are not readily stored in your body and need to be supplied continuously through your diet. On the other hand,  fat-soluble vitamins  are stored in your body’s tissues and retained for longer periods ( 2 ).
Here are the recommendations for water-soluble vitamin intake for women ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10 ,  11 ):
Note that women who smoke need an extra 35 mg of vitamin C per day. Also, pregnant and breastfeeding women under age 19 need 5 mg less of vitamin C per day than pregnant and breastfeeding women ages 19 and older ( 11 ).
Here are the recommendations for fat-soluble vitamin intake for women ( 12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ):
Notably, some argue that the daily vitamin D needs of pregnant and breastfeeding women are much higher than the current recommendations. This will be discussed later in this article ( 16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  19 ,  20 ).
In addition to vitamins, minerals are essential to women’s health. Women are more likely to be low in certain minerals, such as iron. Plus, needs for minerals like iron and iodine significantly increase during pregnancy ( 1 ).
Here are the current daily recommendations for some of the most important minerals for women ( 21 ,  22 ,  23 ,  24 ,  25 ,  26 ,  27 ):

Nutrient needs differ throughout a woman’s life
A woman’s nutrient needs change throughout her lifetime.
Deficiencies are more common during certain life stages, such as pregnancy, and under certain circumstances, such as when a woman smokes or drinks excessively or has a medical condition.
For this reason, women may need to supplement with one or more nutrients in order to reach the recommended intake levels.
Girls ages 9–13 generally need smaller amounts of vitamins than older teens and women because of their smaller body sizes. However, teens over age 14 have vitamin and mineral needs similar to those of adults.
Research shows that teenage girls are more likely to become deficient in some nutrients than the general population. For example, teenage girls are at a greater risk of developing deficiencies in vitamin D and folate ( 28 ,  29 ,  30 ).
Research has shown that many  teens consume diets low in vitamins and minerals . This puts them at risk of deficiency, including during pregnancy, a time during which most nutrient needs increase ( 31 ,  32 ).
Women ages 19–50 are  more likely to be deficient  in several nutrients, including vitamin D, iron, and B6.
A study that included data on more than 15,000 people found that nutrient deficiency risk, including deficiencies in B6 and vitamin D, was most common in women in this age range ( 33 ).
During pregnancy and breastfeeding,  nutrient needs increase  to support fetal and maternal health.
For this reason, pregnant and breastfeeding women are at a greater risk of developing vitamin deficiencies ( 34 ).
In fact, up to 30% of pregnant women worldwide experience vitamin deficiencies. For example, researchers estimate that 18–84% of pregnant women worldwide are deficient in vitamin D ( 35 ,  36 ).
What’s more, evidence suggests that the current recommendations for certain vitamins, including vitamin D, for pregnant women are too low.
According to recent research, pregnant women may need about 4,000 IU per day to maintain optimal vitamin D levels, while breastfeeding women may need about 6,400 IU per day ( 16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  19 ,  20 ).
Choline  is another important nutrient for fetal and maternal health. Studies show that most pregnant women in the United States aren’t getting the recommended 450 mg per day of choline. Unfortunately, many prenatal vitamins do not contain choline ( 37 ).
Postmenopausal women are more likely to become deficient in certain nutrients, including calcium, magnesium, and vitamins C, D, B6, and B12 ( 38 ,  39 ,  40 ,  41 ).
Older adults — typically defined as ages 60 and older — often have inadequate dietary intakes and take medications that may reduce vitamin levels in the body, increasing their risk of developing one or more vitamin deficiencies ( 41 ).
In addition to age and pregnancy, other factors can influence nutrient needs and increase your risk of developing  nutrient deficiencies , including:
body weight
medical conditions
medications
alcohol use
For example, women with certain medical conditions, including type 2 diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and gastrointestinal conditions, are more likely to develop a deficiency in one or more vitamins than the general population.
Studies also show that women with obesity are at greater risk of vitamin deficiencies, including B12 and vitamin D ( 42 ).
Skin tone can also impact nutrient needs. African American women are more likely than European American women to have vitamin D deficiencies, in part because they have higher concentrations of the skin pigment melanin, which blocks the UVB sunlight needed to produce vitamin D in the skin ( 43 ).
Additionally, deficiencies are common among women with eating disorders and those who follow restrictive diets ( 44 ,  45 ,  46 ).

When to supplement
Although maintaining a healthy and well-balanced diet is important to promote optimal nutrient intake, it’s not always possible for women to get all the vitamins, minerals, and other critical nutrients they need through their diet alone.
Some women may need to supplement with one or more nutrients to reach and maintain optimal levels, including those who:
are older
are African American
have certain medical conditions
follow diets that eliminate certain food groups
have eating disorders
smoke or drink heavily
have obesity
are pregnant
use some common prescription drugs, such as proton pump inhibitors and blood-sugar-lowering medications ( 53 )
In addition to consuming a  varied, nutrient-dense diet , pregnant and breastfeeding women are advised to take a prenatal supplement before, during, and after pregnancy.
Doing so may help maintain healthy nutrient levels and support their bodies throughout pregnancy, breastfeeding, and postnatal recovery ( 54 ).
Even though health professionals focus on the importance of increasing vitamin intake during pregnancy and breastfeeding, studies show that many women have insufficient intake of certain nutrients during and after pregnancy ( 54 ).
Experts recommend that most women over age 50 take a B12 or B-complex vitamin because of the high prevalence of B12 malabsorption from food in older populations ( 55 ,  56 )
Vitamin D deficiency  and insufficiency are widespread. Women, especially those who have obesity or certain medical conditions, are pregnant, or are older, should have their vitamin D levels checked to determine an appropriate supplement dosage.
Women at risk of developing a nutrient deficiency should work with a healthcare professional to develop an appropriate and safe supplement regimen based on their specific needs.

How to choose
While some women may need to supplement with only one or two nutrients, such as B12 or  iron , others may benefit from taking a multinutrient supplement that provides a range of vitamins, minerals, and other helpful compounds for women’s health.
In general, it’s best to get advice from a healthcare professional before supplementing with any nutrient. A healthcare professional can test your nutrient levels if necessary and give you specific dosing recommendations.
It’s important to understand that not all women need dietary supplements — especially not women who are generally healthy, have no nutrient deficiencies, and follow a well-rounded diet.
Nevertheless, many women do need to take supplements, especially those who are pregnant, follow restrictive diets, or have one or more nutrient deficiencies.
When shopping for a supplement, there are a few things to keep in mind:
Quality:  It’s important to choose high quality brands that use third-party testing for quality and purity, such as those certified by organizations like UL Solutions, USP, and NSF International.
Form and serving type:  For those who cannot tolerate swallowing large pills, many companies offer powdered, liquid, or chewable supplements that may be a better option.
Ingredients and certifications:  If you have allergies or dietary restrictions, look for products that are free from common allergens and ingredients like gluten and dairy. Some products are also certified vegan.
Dosing:  It’s important to consider dosing, especially if you’re taking a dietary supplement to treat a deficiency. For example, women who have a vitamin D deficiency generally need higher dose supplements than those who need to maintain healthy vitamin D levels.
If you have questions about brands, vitamin and mineral forms, or dosing, consult a healthcare professional for advice.

Frequently asked questions
The types of vitamins you should take daily depend on your needs. Also, keep in mind that many women do not need to take any supplements on a regular basis.
To support your vaginal health, it’s best to focus on your  diet as a whole  rather than on specific vitamins and minerals.
For example, a healthy diet can help promote healthy bacterial composition in your gut and vaginal canal and may help prevent conditions like bacterial vaginosis ( 57 ,  58 ).
Probiotic supplements  may help improve vaginal health  as well, though more research is needed ( 51 ,  52 ).
Yes, probiotics can be taken alongside nutrient supplements such as vitamins and minerals.
However, keep in mind that not everyone needs a probiotic, so it’s best to get advice from a healthcare professional before purchasing a probiotic supplement, especially if you’re trying to treat a specific condition, such as IBS.
Many people can get all the nutrients they need by eating a  healthy, well-rounded diet .
However, many populations — including pregnant women, those on restrictive diets, older adults, and people with certain medical conditions — need extra support from dietary supplements in order to reach and maintain optimal nutrient levels.
It’s important to understand that, although a nutritious diet is the best way to provide your body with nutrients, supplements can be helpful and may even be necessary for many people.
If you’re concerned that you’re not getting enough nutrients through your diet, contact a registered dietitian or another healthcare professional for advice.

The bottom line
Nutrients, including vitamins and minerals, are essential to women’s health and play numerous roles in your body.
Although many women can obtain the nutrients they need by consuming a well-rounded diet, some women cannot meet their nutrient needs through diet alone.
Certain factors and circumstances, including age, pregnancy and breastfeeding, medical conditions, medication use, and lifestyle habits, increase a woman’s risk of nutrient deficiency and developing suboptimal nutrient levels.
Women who are either concerned that they may be at risk of developing a nutrient deficiency or interested in optimizing their vitamin intake should work with a qualified healthcare professional to ensure optimal dosing, safety, and necessity.
