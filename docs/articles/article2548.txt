Title: Hashimoto Diet: Overview, Foods, Supplements, and Tips

Certain eating plans, including the Autoimmune Protocol diet and a grain—or gluten-free diet, may help reduce inflammation that contributes to Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition that gradually destroys thyroid tissue via lymphocytes, which are white blood cells that are part of your immune system
The  thyroid  is a butterfly-shaped endocrine gland at the base of the neck that secretes hormones affecting nearly every organ system. It also controls metabolism and growth. Eventually, damage to this gland leads to insufficient thyroid hormone production.
This article explains the diet and lifestyle modifications most likely to benefit those with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.

How diet and lifestyle affect Hashimoto’s
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis  is one of the  most common  thyroid disorders in the United States and other developed countries. Even when treated with medication, its symptoms may significantly affect quality of life.
Research  shows that diet and lifestyle play vital roles in managing Hashimoto’s, as numerous individuals find that their symptoms persist even with medication. Plus, many people who exhibit symptoms aren’t given medication unless they have altered hormone levels.
Specifically, diet and lifestyle changes can help with several different factors related to Hashimoto’s. For example, cutting certain foods out  may help  reduce inflammation, which is often tied to diet and  may be  a driving factor in Hashimoto’s.
Diet and lifestyle modifications can also help reduce your chance of developing comorbidities such as  obesity  and  diabetes .
Plus, these changes may help slow or prevent thyroid damage caused by elevated thyroid antibodies and manage body weight, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels.
That said, every person with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis responds differently to treatment, which is why an individualized approach is so important.
The following are some evidence-based dietary tips to help treat Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.

Gluten- and grain-free diets
Many studies indicate that those with Hashimoto’s are  more likely  to have  celiac disease  than the general population. As such, experts recommend that everyone diagnosed with Hashimoto’s be screened for  celiac disease .
What’s more, some evidence suggests that  gluten – and grain-free diets may benefit people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.
In a  6-month  study of 34 women with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, a gluten-free diet reduced thyroid antibody levels while improving thyroid function and vitamin D levels, compared with a control group.
Other  research  notes that people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis — or autoimmune diseases in general — likely benefit from a gluten-free diet even if they don’t have celiac disease.

The autoimmune protocol diet
The Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet is designed for people with autoimmune diseases. It removes potentially harmful foods like grains, dairy,  nightshades , added sugar, coffee, legumes, eggs, alcohol, nuts, seeds, refined sugars, oils, and food additives.
In a  10-week study  of 16 women with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, the AIP diet significantly improved quality of life scores and significantly decreased levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP).
Although these results are promising, larger longer-duration studies are needed. This is also an diet that should be prescribed and monitored by an experienced healthcare professional.

Lactose-free diet
Lactose intolerance  is  very common  among people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.
If you suspect lactose intolerance, cutting out dairy may aid digestive issues, as well as thyroid function and medication absorption.
Keep in mind that this strategy may not work for everyone, as some people with Hashimoto’s tolerate  dairy  perfectly well.

Anti-inflammatory diet
Inflammation may be a driving force behind Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. As such, an anti-inflammatory diet rich in fruits and vegetables may significantly improve symptoms.
A  study of 218 women  with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis found that markers of  oxidative stress  — a condition that causes  chronic inflammation  — were lower in those who ate fruits and vegetables more frequently.

Whole-food diet
Following  a diet low in added sugar and  highly processed foods  but rich in whole, nutrient-dense foods may help improve one’s health, manage one’s weight, and reduce Hashimoto’s-related symptoms.
Whenever possible, prepare your meals at home using nutritious foods like vegetables, fruits, proteins,  healthy fats , and fiber-rich carbs.

Helpful supplements for Hashimoto’s
Several supplements  may help  lower inflammation and thyroid antibodies in people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Plus, those with this condition are more likely to be deficient in certain nutrients, so supplementing may be necessary
Beneficial supplements  include:
selenium
zinc
curcumin
vitamin D
B complex vitamins.
magnesium .
iron
Note that  supplementing  with high doses of iodine in the absence of an  iodine deficiency  may lead to adverse effects in those with Hashimoto’s. Don’t take high dose iodine supplements unless a healthcare professional has directed you to do so.

Foods to eat
If you have Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, a nutrient-dense diet may help reduce the severity of your symptoms and improve your overall health. Focus on the  following foods .
fruits
non-starchy vegetables
starchy vegetables
healthy fats
animal protein
gluten-free grains
seeds, nuts, and nut butter
beans and lentils
dairy and nondairy substitutes (fortified with  calcium  and/or vitamin D)
spices, herbs, and condiments
lean animal protein
Keep in mind that some people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis avoid a few of the foods mentioned above, such as grains and dairy. It’s important to experiment with your diet to find out what foods work best for you.

Foods to avoid
Eliminating or restricting the following foods  may help  reduce Hashimoto’s symptoms and improve your overall health :
added sugars  and sweets
fast food  and fried foods
refined grains
highly processed foods  and meats
gluten-containing grains and foods
Note that some  cruciferous vegetables  and  soy  products contain  goitrogens , which are substances that may interfere with thyroid hormone production
Yet cruciferous vegetables are highly nutritious, and cooking them diminishes their goitrogenic activity. Thus, they are  unlikely to interfere  with thyroid function unless eaten in extremely large amounts.
Some evidence also suggests that soy harms thyroid function as well, so many people with Hashimoto’s choose to avoid  soy products . Nonetheless,  more research  is needed.
Although these recommendations may help many individuals, it’s important to experiment with your diet to find the best method for you.
Working with a dietitian who specializes in autoimmune diseases like Hashimoto’s thyroiditis can help you narrow down potentially problematic foods and set up an eating pattern that’ll help you feel your best.

Other lifestyle tips
A  study done in 60 women  with Hashimoto’s found that engaging in  stress reduction practices  helped to reduce their depression and anxiety, improve overall quality of life, and lower thyroid antibodies.
Additionally, for maximum absorption, it’s best to take thyroid medication on an empty stomach at least  30–60 minutes  before breakfast or at least 3–4 hours after dinner.
Keep in mind that when you’re first starting medication, it may take a few weeks or longer to start feeling better. If your symptoms aren’t improving, speak with a healthcare professional about other options.
As Hashimoto’s symptoms may significantly affect your quality of life and mental health, be sure to find a healthcare team that you trust. This may take some time, but it’s essential to getting the right treatment.

Frequently asked questions
If you adopt the AIP diet, you will want to cut out eggs. Otherwise, you should ask your doctor whether eggs should be included in your diet, as every person is different.
Unlike other autoimmune diseases, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis doesn’t have distinct “flares.” Instead, it slowly damages the thyroid gland over time. Eventually, it can progress to hypothyroidism, where the thyroid can no longer produce enough hormones.
Certain factors can affect the severity of Hashimoto’s symptoms. This includes nutritional deficiencies, as well as medications and supplements if they interfere with your thyroid medication. Stress can also worsen the condition by slowing down metabolism and hormone levels.

The bottom line
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is a common autoimmune condition that  affects the thyroid . It causes numerous symptoms that may persist even if you take thyroid medication.
Research shows that dietary and lifestyle changes can significantly improve your symptoms and boost your overall health. However, every person with  Hashimoto’s thyroiditis  is different, so it’s fundamental to find a dietary pattern that suits your needs.
A dietitian or other healthcare professional who specializes in autoimmune diseases may be able to help you find an eating pattern that works for you.
