Title: Cissus quadrangularis: Uses, Benefits, Side Effects, and Dosage

Studies show that the  Cissus quadrangularis  plant may promote bone health and reduce joint pain, among other benefits. However, more research on the plant’s medicinal properties is needed.
Cissus quadrangularis  is a plant that has been revered for its medicinal properties for thousands of years.
Historically, it has been used to treat many conditions, including hemorrhoids, gout, asthma, and allergies.
However, recent research has found that this power-packed plant may also help promote bone health, relieve joint pain, and protect against chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and stroke.
This article reviews the uses, benefits, and side effects of  Cissus quadrangularis , as well as its dosage information.

What is it?
Cissus quadrangularis , also known as veldt grape, adamant creeper, or devil’s backbone, is a plant that belongs to the grape family.
Native to certain parts of Asia, Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula,  Cissus quadrangularis  has long been used as a natural remedy to treat a wide variety of ailments ( 1 ).
Since ancient times, people have used it to help treat pain, regulate menstruation, and repair bone fractures ( 1 ).
The healing properties of this plant are attributed to its high contents of  vitamin C  and antioxidant compounds like carotenoids, tannins, and phenols ( 2 ).
Today, extracts produced from its leaf, root, and stem are widely available as herbal supplements. They can be found in powder, capsule, or syrup form.
Cissus quadrangularis  is a plant that’s rich in vitamin C and antioxidants. It has been used to treat an array of health conditions for centuries, and, today, its extracts are widely available as herbal supplements.

Uses of Cissus quadrangularis
Cissus quadrangularis  is used particularly to treat the following conditions:
hemorrhoids
obesity
allergies
asthma
bone loss
gout
diabetes
high cholesterol
While  Cissus quadrangularis  has been shown to help treat some of these conditions, research on some of its uses is either lacking or has failed to show any benefits.
For example, one study in 570 people found that  Cissus quadrangularis  was no more effective than a placebo at reducing symptoms of hemorrhoids ( 3 ).
Meanwhile, no research to date has evaluated the plant’s effects on conditions like allergies, asthma, and gout.
Cissus quadrangularis  is used as an herbal supplement to treat conditions such as hemorrhoids, bone loss, allergies, asthma, and diabetes. Research backing many of these uses is weak or has failed to show any benefits.

Benefits of Cissus quadrangularis
Although  Cissus quadrangularis  is used to treat a number of health conditions, only a few of these uses are backed by research.
Here are the top science-based benefits of  Cissus quadrangularis .
Animal and human studies have found that  Cissus quadrangularis  may help reduce bone loss, speed the healing of fractures, and help prevent conditions like osteoporosis.
In fact, an 11-week study found that feeding  Cissus quadrangularis  to mice with osteoporosis helped prevent bone loss by altering levels of certain proteins involved in bone metabolism ( 4 ).
What’s more, a study in 9 people observed that taking 500 mg of  Cissus quadrangularis  3 times per day for 6 weeks helped speed the healing of fractured jaw bones. It also appeared to reduce pain and swelling ( 5 ).
Similarly, a 3-month study in 60 people showed that taking 1,200 mg of  Cissus quadrangularis  daily promoted fracture healing and increased levels of a specific protein required for bone formation ( 6 ).
Cissus quadrangularis  has been shown to help reduce joint pain and relieve symptoms of  arthritis , a condition characterized by swollen, stiff joints.
One 8-week study in 29 men with chronic joint pain found that taking 3,200 mg of  Cissus quadrangularis  daily significantly reduced exercise-induced joint pain ( 7 ).
Another study observed that feeding  Cissus quadrangularis  extract to rats reduced joint swelling and decreased several markers of inflammation, indicating that it may help treat arthritis ( 8 ).
Furthermore, a study in rats with arthritis noted similar findings, reporting that  Cissus quadrangularis  was more effective at reducing swelling than common medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and decrease inflammation ( 9 ).
However, human studies in this area are lacking, and more research is needed to investigate the potential benefits of  Cissus quadrangularis  on joint health.
Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that can increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.
These conditions include  excess belly fat , high blood pressure and blood sugar, and increased cholesterol or triglyceride levels ( 10 ).
Some research shows that  Cissus quadrangularis  may help prevent metabolic syndrome by improving several of these conditions.
In an 8-week study, 123 people took 1,028 mg of  Cissus quadrangularis  daily, as well as a combination of other supplements, including  green tea , selenium, and chromium.
This treatment significantly decreased body weight and belly fat, regardless of diet. It also improved fasting blood sugar, triglycerides, and total and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels ( 11 ).
In another 10-week study, 72 people took 300 mg of  Cissus quadrangularis  daily. Researchers observed that it reduced body weight, body fat, waist size, blood sugar, and total and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels ( 12 ).
However, it’s important to note that one analysis of nine studies found that  Cissus quadrangularis  only increased weight loss when used in combination with other supplements — not when taken on its own ( 13 ).
Due to a lack of studies on the effects of  Cissus quadrangularis  on metabolic syndrome, it’s unclear if it can help prevent or treat this condition.
Studies show that  Cissus quadrangularis  may improve bone health and reduce joint pain. A small body of evidence suggests it might also help prevent metabolic syndrome, but more research is needed.

Potential side effects
When taken as directed,  Cissus quadrangularis  can be used safely with minimal risk of side effects ( 13 ,  14 ).
However, some minor side effects have been reported, the most common of which include gas, diarrhea, dry mouth, headaches, and insomnia ( 11 ).
Given the limited research on the safety of taking  Cissus quadrangularis  during pregnancy, it’s best to avoid it if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
Additionally, check with your healthcare provider before starting  Cissus quadrangularis  supplements if you’re receiving treatment for diabetes. It may lower blood sugar levels and could interfere with your medications ( 11 ).
Cissus quadrangularis  may cause mild side effects, such as dry mouth, headaches, insomnia, and digestive issues. Also, consult your healthcare provider before using it if you’re pregnant or taking medications for diabetes.

Dosage
Currently, there is no official recommended dosage for  Cissus quadrangularis .
Most supplements come in powder, capsule, or syrup form and are widely available  online  and at natural health shops and pharmacies.
Most of these products recommend doses of 500 or 1,000 mg per day.
However, studies have found doses of 300–3,200 mg per day to provide benefits ( 7 ,  12 ).
Ideally, you should start with a lower dose and slowly work your way up to assess your tolerance.
As with any dietary supplement, consult your healthcare provider before taking  Cissus quadrangularis .
Most  Cissus quadrangularis  supplements are available in doses of 500 or 1,000 mg per day. However, studies show that doses of 300–3,200 mg are safe for most people.

The bottom line
The  Cissus quadrangularis  plant has been used to treat a variety of ailments for centuries.
Some studies show it may have powerful medicinal properties, including supporting bone health, reducing joint pain, and helping prevent metabolic syndrome.
However, more research on the plant’s potential benefits is needed.
Cissus quadrangularis  is generally safe and associated with few side effects. However, consult your healthcare provider before adding it to your natural healthcare routine to ensure it’s the right choice for your needs.
