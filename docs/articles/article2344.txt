Title: 19 Healthy, Dairy-Free Snacks

If you follow a dairy-free diet for personal, health-related, or religious reasons, you may have a hard time narrowing down snacking options that don’t contain milk, cheese, yogurt, and other dairy-derived ingredients ( 1 ).
This may be especially difficult when shopping for pre-made snack foods. These food often contain dairy and dairy-derived ingredients like milk powder, whey protein, and casein ( 1 ).
Fortunately, there are a variety of dairy-free snacks to choose from, including pre-made, kid-friendly, sweet, and savory options.
This article explores 19 nutritious dairy-free snacks.

Sweet dairy-free snack options
If you’re craving a sweet, dairy-free snack, you’re in luck!
The following options will hit the sweet spot for people following dairy-free diets:
Energy balls are easy to make and are a perfect choice when you’re craving something sweet.
Plus, they can be customized based on your flavor preferences. Make them in larger batches and place them in your refrigerator or freezer so you always have a nutritious snack on hand.
Simply toss ingredients like coconut flour, nut butter, oats, vanilla, salt, and dates into a  food processor  and pulse until they’re a smooth consistency. Then roll the mixture into balls and store in your fridge or freezer.

Baked goods like muffins are delicious, but they’re often lacking filling ingredients like protein and fiber. They also tend to be high in added sugar.
They also often contain dairy products like milk and butter.
However, there are ways to make delicious baked goods that are filling and dairy-free.
This dairy-free  Banana Protein Muffin  recipe from The Healthy Consultant contains dairy-free protein powder, which boosts the protein content of this dish.
If you love yogurt but are following a dairy-free diet, give coconut yogurt a try.
Like dairy-based yogurt, coconut yogurt is rich and creamy, making it a perfect ingredient for dairy-free snacks like yogurt parfaits.
To make a sweet, crunchy, and creamy coconut yogurt parfait, layer your coconut yogurt with your choice of the following ingredients:
fresh fruit like berries, diced apples, or bananas
nuts or seeds like  pumpkin seeds , sunflower seeds, or chopped almonds.
low sugar granola like Purely Elizabeth or Paleonola
toppings like chia seeds, ground flaxseed, cacao nibs, and unsweetened coconut

Salty and savory dairy-free snack options
For people on dairy-free diets who prefer salty and savory snacks over sweet, the following options are sure to be a hit:
Tuna salad is typically made with canned tuna, mayo, and chopped celery. It’s nutritious and filling — packed with nutrients like protein, healthy fats,  vitamin B12 , and selenium ( 2 ).
Even though some people think mayo is a dairy product, most types of mayo are actually dairy-free. This makes tuna salad a great choice for those on a dairy-free diet.
Try pairing tuna salad with sliced vegetables like celery and carrot sticks for some extra fiber and crunch.
For a quick, savory snack idea, grab a container and fill it with your favorite dairy free snack foods.
Make sure you choose a mix of ingredients that provide fiber, protein, and fat for a balanced snack that will help keep you feeling satisfied ( 3 ).
Here are some examples of dairy-free snack pairings:
salted almonds, hard-boiled eggs, and sliced vegetables
hummus , cherry tomatoes, olives, and crackers

Chickpeas are an excellent source of plant-based protein and fiber. They can be paired with a variety of ingredients to make a savory snack.
To make a quick and colorful snack that’s dairy-free as well as vegan and gluten-free, combine a can of chickpeas with sliced cherry tomatoes, red onions, cucumber, and avocado.
Drizzle your salad with olive oil, fresh lemon juice, white wine vinegar, and a sprinkle of salt. Store your salad in glass jars for easy transport.
Pizza-flavored snack foods usually contain dairy–derived ingredients — making them off limits for those following dairy-free diets.
Fortunately, even though this  Pizza Roasted Nuts  recipe from From My Bowl is packed with cheezy pizza flavor, it’s cheese-free and safe for those who need to avoid dairy.

Kid-friendly dairy-free snacks

For a crunchy, cheesy, kid-friendly snack that’s high in fiber and plant-based protein, try out this  Cheezy Herb Roasted Chickpea  recipe.
The cheesy flavor comes from nutritional yeast, which makes an excellent cheese substitute in dairy-free recipes.

Your child will love the sweet and creamy taste of this  Peanut Butter and Jelly Chia Pudding , which is made with chia seeds, natural peanut butter, almond milk, a bit of maple syrup, and frozen berries.

Avocados  boast a creamy texture and mild taste that kids love. Plus, they’re high in fiber, healthy fats, magnesium, and folate, making them a perfect ingredient for your dairy-free snacks ( 6 ).
Mashing some avocado with lime juice and a bit of sea salt creates a kid-friendly guacamole that can be served with nutritious, crunchy foods like veggie sticks and plantain chips.
Have your child help you prepare their snack by mashing the avocados and mixing in the lime juice.
These  Mini Chicken and Carrot Meatballs  are sure to be a hit with toddlers and older kids alike.
They’re packed with protein from the chicken, plus the vegetables can be tweaked to accommodate your child’s flavor preferences. For example, if they’re not a fan of carrots, try chopped broccoli or asparagus instead.
Veggie meatballs are a great way to add more vegetables into your kid’s diet in a tasty way.

How to shop for dairy-free snacks
People follow dairy-free diets for a number of reasons, including food allergies, religious beliefs, and health concerns ( 7 ,  8 ).
Plus, those following vegan diets may avoid dairy for environmental and ethical reasons ( 9 ).
Some people may choose to avoid all dairy products, including dairy-derived ingredients like whey protein and casein, while others only avoid milk, cheese, and yogurt.
No matter why you’re following a dairy-free diet, it’s important to read labels when you’re grocery shopping to avoid unintentional consumption of dairy.
While some foods like milk, yogurt, ice cream, and butter are more obvious sources of dairy, many pre-made and packaged foods contain dairy — even items that you may not expect.
Be sure to read ingredient labels and keep an eye out for dairy-based ingredients like:
milk, evaporated milk, milk powder, or cream
cheese
butter
casein
buttermilk
sweetened condensed milk
whey protein
These are just some examples of dairy-based ingredients you may spot on food labels.
Keep in mind that, by law, companies must label food products that contain milk. However, alcoholic beverages that contain milk do not have to follow this label law, so it’s possible that alcoholic beverages may contain hidden dairy-based ingredients ( 10 ).
Food products are sometimes labeled “dairy-free,” “vegan,” and “paleo” — which can help people following dairy-free diets identify products that are safe for them to eat.
Still, it’s always a smart idea to read the ingredient label even when a product claims to be dairy-free.
Those with milk allergies should exercise even more caution when shopping for food than those who follow a dairy-free diet for personal or religious reasons. This is because they’re likely intolerant to lactose and may deal with unpleasant side effects.
Cow’s milk allergy (CMA) affects a small percentage of infants and children and is very rare in adults. CMA is serious and can lead to anaphylaxis if milk is ingested, which can be fatal ( 11 ).
For this reason, parents and caregivers of children with CMA have to be diligent about reading labels and food safety. Here’s a more  detailed list  of milk ingredients to look out for when grocery shopping.
When shopping for dairy-free snacks, it’s important to scan ingredient labels for dairy and dairy-derived ingredients. Parents and caregivers of children with CMA have to be especially careful when food shopping.

The bottom line
Milk, cheese, butter, and other dairy-based ingredients can be found in a number of snack foods, from chips to protein bars.
This can make it difficult for those following dairy-free diets to find nutritious, dairy-free snacks.
Fortunately, there’s a number of recipes and pre-made snacks that are dairy-free that make healthy snack choices for kids and adults.
If you want to add a cheesy taste to dishes like popcorn, soups, and pastas, try  fortified nutritional yeast . It’s not only a delicious dairy-free cheese substitute but also great for those following vegan diets as it’s high in vitamin B12.
