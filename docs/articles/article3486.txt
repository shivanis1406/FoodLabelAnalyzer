Title: What Is Corn Silk, and Does It Have Benefits?

Corn silk is a thread-like fiber found at the top of corn cobs. They are not usually eaten but are used by some as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and herbal remedy for certain conditions.
Corn silk is the long, silky threads that grow on corncobs.
Though it’s often discarded when corn is prepared for eating, it may have several medicinal applications.
As an herbal remedy, corn silk has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese and Native American medicine. It’s still used today in many countries, including China, France, Turkey, and the United States.
This article explains everything you need to know about corn silk, including its uses, benefits, and dosage.

What is corn silk, and how is it used?
Corn silk is the long, thread-like strands of plant material that grow underneath the husk of a fresh ear of corn.
These shiny, thin fibers aid the pollination and growth of  corn , but they’re also used in traditional herbal medicine practices.
Corn silk contains a variety of plant compounds that may be responsible for various health effects.
In traditional Chinese and Native American medicine, it’s  used to treat  a variety of ailments, including prostate problems, malaria, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and heart disease.
More recent research indicates that it may also help reduce blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and inflammation.
Corn silk may be used fresh but is often dried before being consumed as a  tea  or extract. It may also be taken as a pill.

Potential benefits of corn silk
Although corn silk is routinely used in herbal medicine, studies on it are limited.
However, preliminary research suggests that it may have health benefits, especially for certain types of inflammatory conditions like heart disease and diabetes.
Antioxidants are plant compounds that protect your body’s cells against free radical damage and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is one of the major causes of a number of chronic conditions, including diabetes, heart disease,  cancer , and inflammation.
Corn silk is a naturally rich source of flavonoid  antioxidants .
It also contains various other antioxidants  like :
sterols
saponins
allantoin
alkaloid
vitamin K
vitamin C
polyphenols
tannins
In some areas, it is used as a diuretic, and in other areas, it is used to treat bladder disorders.
Inflammation is part of your body’s natural immune response. However, excessive inflammation is linked to a variety of illnesses, including heart disease and diabetes.
A  2022 study  on Mongolian gerbils found that corn silk may help to prevent stroke due in part to its ability to reduce inflammation.
Another animal  study from 2024  also found that corn silk had an anti-inflammatory response in mice.
This stringy plant fiber also contains  magnesium , which helps regulate your body’s inflammatory response.
The results of these studies cannot be directly applied to humans, however. Clinical human trials are needed to verify the results and the anti-inflammatory nature of corn silk.
Some research indicates that corn silk may  lower blood sugar  and help manage diabetes symptoms.
One  animal study from 2024  on mice with type 1 diabetes showed that corn silk may help reduce gut microbiota and intestinal inflammation that are associated with the condition. It also noted that corn silk may be a potential therapeutic option for type 1 diabetes.
A  review from 2023  also notes that was shown to increase the production of insulin in rats. It also helped to recover damage to the pancreas and control blood sugar levels in the rats. This means that corn silk may help to prevent hyperglycemia, which is an unusually high concentration of glucose (sugar) in the blood.
Although these results are promising, human studies are needed.
Corn silk may be an effective treatment for high blood pressure.
First, it encourages the elimination of  excess fluid  from your body. As such, it  could be  a natural alternative to prescribed diuretics, which are often used to reduce blood pressure.
A  systemic review and meta-analysis from 2019  also found that corn silk tea combined with typical hypertensive treatments may be more effective than the traditional treatments on their own.
Still, more human research is needed.
Corn silk may also  lower cholesterol .
One  animal study from 2020  found that mice given corn silk extract experienced significant reductions in total and LDL (bad) cholesterol alongside increases in HDL (good) cholesterol.
In an  animal study from 2016  on mice fed a  high fat diet , those that received corn silk experienced significantly lower total cholesterol than those that did not get this supplement.
More research and clinical human trials are needed to verify the effects of corn silk on cholesterol levels.

Corn silk side effects and precautions
While very few adverse effects have been reported, corn silk may not be safe for everyone.
If you’ve experienced an allergic reaction to corn or corn products, you should avoid corn silk.
Furthermore, corn silk is not recommended if you take any of the following medications:
diuretics
blood pressure drugs
diabetes medicine
anti-inflammatory drugs, like steroids
blood thinners
What’s more, you should avoid this product if you’re taking potassium supplements or have been treated for  low potassium levels , as corn silk may increase the excretion of this mineral, according to  2019 animal research .
Additionally, it’s important to consider the quality of the supplement you buy.
In certain countries, including the United States, herbal supplements are not regulated. Therefore, it’s best to choose a brand that has been tested by a third party.
Be sure to check the ingredient list on  the label , as other herbs are sometimes added.
If you’re uncertain whether corn silk is an appropriate supplement for your routine, consult your medical practitioner.

The bottom line
Corn silk is a natural corn fiber used in traditional Chinese and Native American medicine.
Research is limited, but some studies suggest that it may reduce inflammation, blood sugar, and blood pressure.
While corn silk is likely safe for most people, you should consult your medical practitioner before taking it.
