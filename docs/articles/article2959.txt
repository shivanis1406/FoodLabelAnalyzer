Title: 9 High Protein Nuts and Seeds to Eat

Both nuts and seeds are versatile, easy to eat on the go, and a good source of plant-based protein, especially for those who eat few or no animal products.
Seeds are the embryos of a plant. Technically, nuts are a type of seed with a tough outer layer. So while all nuts are seeds, not all seeds are nuts.
However, the  Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) may classify certain seeds as nuts to make it easier for you to identify  them as a possible allergen.
That said, if you’re not allergic, eating either  nuts  or  seeds  can help you meet your protein needs. Protein is  necessary  for building bones, muscles, and skin. Protein also increases feelings of fullness, helping you stay satisfied and energized.
While all nuts contain protein, some provide more than others. This article reviews 8 nuts that are high in protein in ascending order.

1. Walnuts
Protein:   4.5 g per 1/4 cup (29 g)  serving of chopped walnuts.
Eating  walnuts  is a delicious way to boost your protein intake.
Walnuts are also a source of heart- healthy fats . Specifically, they contain more  omega-3 fatty acids , in the form of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), than any other nut.
Some observational studies  have linked  ALA intake to a lower risk of heart disease.
With their fatty texture and mouthfeel, walnuts are a good addition to ground meats and can further increase the protein content of meat-based dishes.

2. Pine nuts
Protein:   4.5 g per 1/4 cup (34 g)  of pine nuts. A 1/4-cup (34 g) serving of pine nuts provides 4 of protein and 23 g.
Pine nuts  are technically not nuts, though they are seeds.
The fat in pine nuts mostly comes from unsaturated fats, which  may help  reduce risk factors for heart disease. Based on animal studies only, ene of the fatty acids in pine nuts  may also exhibit  anti-inflammatory effects. It may also help prevent cancer from spreading.
Toasted pine nuts are a delicious way to add some extra protein to salads, grain bowls, or vegetables. To toast pine nuts at home, cook them in a skillet over medium heat for a few minutes until fragrant.

3. Brazil nuts
Protein:   4.75 g per 1/4 cup (33 g)  serving.
Brazil nuts  are also technically seeds, but not nuts. They come from a rainforest tree and are easy to spot in a bag of mixed nuts, as they’re usually the biggest ones.
Along with protein, Brazil nuts provide healthy fats, fiber, and an assortment of micronutrients. What’s more, they are one of the best food sources of  selenium , an essential mineral that  supports  thyroid health and protects the body from infection.
Just one Brazil nut (5 g) has almost 175% of the DV for selenium necessary for people who aren’t pregnant or nursing.
Try mixing Brazil nuts with other nuts and seeds, dried mango, and  dark chocolate  chunks for a protein-rich trail mix.

4. Cashews
Protein:   5 g per 1/4 cup (32 g)  of cashews.
Cashews are also technically seeds,  but not nuts. They’re high in protein and contain several important vitamins and minerals.
A 1/4 cup (32 g) serving provides about 80% of the Daily Value (DV) for copper.  Copper  is a mineral that  supports  immunity and aids the creation of red blood cells and connective tissue.
Studies  have also found  a link between low copper intake and an increased risk of  osteoporosis , a condition characterized by weak and brittle bones.
Thus, getting more copper in your diet by eating cashews may be one way to help protect against this condition.
To enjoy more  cashews  in your diet, eat them as part of a balanced snack on top of plain yogurt with fruit.

5. Hazelnuts
Protein:  5 g per 1/4 cup (34 g)  serving.
Hazelnuts  have a slightly sweet, buttery, and toasted flavor, making them a particularly delicious source of protein.
Studies have also found that adding hazelnuts to your diet may help reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol and increase HDL (good) cholesterol, thereby  helping lower the risk  of heart disease.
For a  high protein snack , make some homemade “Nutella” spread. Blend 1 cup (135 g) of hazelnuts with 2 scoops (60 g) of chocolate protein powder, 1 tablespoon (6 g) of  cocoa powder , and two tablespoons (tbsp) or 30 milliliters (mL) of maple syrup.
Pine nuts are the seeds of certain varieties of pine cones. They’re prized for their mild, sweet taste and buttery texture, which comes from their high fat content.

6. Pistachios
Protein:   6 g per 1/4 cup (30 g)  serving of  pistachios .
Pistachios  are also a  seed but not a nut . A serving of pistachios provides as much protein as one egg.
Compared with most other nuts, these nuts have a  higher ratio  of  essential amino acids  relative to their protein content .
Essential amino acids  must be obtained  through the diet so that the body can use them to build proteins necessary for important functions.
For a fun way to eat pistachios, try blending them into nut butter and spreading it on toast, apples, or crackers.

7. Almonds
Protein:  About  7 grams (g) per 1/4 cup (35 g)  serving of  almonds .
Almonds are also seeds, but not nuts. However, like many other options on this list, people often group them with nuts and consider them to be a high protein option.
Almonds are high in protein and loaded with  antioxidants . These plant compounds  protect  the body from free-radical-induced  oxidative stress , which can lead to aging, heart disease, and some cancers.
The brown layer of skin surrounding almonds contains the  highest concentration  of antioxidants, so it’s best to eat almonds with the skin for the most benefits.
To make a balanced snack with almonds, pair them with a piece of fruit.

8. Peanuts
Protein:   9.5 g per 1/4 cup (37 g ) serving.
Peanuts  are a legume, a type of seed that grows in a pod. Botanically, they’re more similar to  soybeans  or lentils than to nuts.
Like most  legumes , they provide a lot of plant-based protein. In fact, peanuts have the highest protein content out of all commonly consumed foods people commonly refer to as nuts.
Peanuts are also one of the  best food sources  of  biotin , a vitamin that  helps convert  food into usable energy in the body.
For a balanced snack that provides protein, fats, and carbs, combine peanut butter and bananas on their own, or assemble them on top of toast.

9. Pumpkin seeds
Protein:   10 g per 1/4 cup (36 g)  serving.
Pumpkin seeds  can be a highly nutritious snack with a mild flavor and a chewy texture. They contain almost double the protein as most other choices on this list.
Like other nuts and seeds, they’re  high in antioxidants  and contain  important nutrients like selenium, magnesium, zinc, potassium, and phosphorous.
Research  shows these nutrients may help protect your body from inflammation, diseases like arthritis or diabetes, mood disorders like depression, heart disease, and even certain cancers.
Throw some pumpkin seeds into your salad, and try roasting them for a crunchier, nuttier flavor.

Frequently asked questions
Foods that are rich in all nine crucial amino acids are typically classified as sources of  complete protein .  Pistachio nuts  are a complete protein. Additional  seeds that are complete proteins  include  chia seeds  and hemp seeds.
One large egg (50 g) contains about  6 g of protein.  By comparison, 50 grams of any nut or seed on this list will contain more than 6 g of protein.

The bottom line
Nuts are a healthy source of plant-based protein. For anyone who isn’t  allergic , they make a convenient snack, and you can add them to many dishes to boost their protein content.
The nuts on this list are all  good sources of protein , with peanuts providing the most protein per serving.
If you cannot eat peanuts or want to try some different protein-rich nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, and Brazil nuts are a few interesting options.
