Title: The 5 Best Flour Options for Diabetes

If you have diabetes, you may need to limit the amount of carbs you eat. However, there are several types of flour that may suit individuals with diabetes. Read on to learn about good flour options, as well as flours you may want to limit.
If you have diabetes, finding healthy low carb recipes can be challenging.
Modifying recipes to meet your needs is one of the easiest and most effective ways to give dishes a diabetes-friendly twist. Doing so often requires swapping out ingredients like white flour for low carb alternatives.
Several flour options are suitable for people with diabetes.
Here are a few of the best flour options for people with diabetes, along with a few that you may want to limit or avoid.

1. Almond flour
Almond flour  is made from finely ground almonds and is a great gluten-free alternative to regular flour.
Almond flour is  low in carbs and high in protein , fiber, and heart-healthy fats. This gives it a low  glycemic index , which is a measure of how much certain foods affect your blood sugar levels.
According to  researchers , low glycemic index foods are effective for managing diabetes.
Almond flour has a mild, nutty flavor. You can use it in place of wheat flour in many recipes, including muffins, cookies, bread, and biscuits.
However, keep in mind that it may give foods a denser texture. This is because almond flour does not contain gluten. According to  research , gluten is the protein that gives dough its elasticity and helps baked goods rise.
You can generally substitute 1 cup of almond flour for 1 cup of regular flour.
Almond flour is low in carbs and high in protein, fiber, and heart-healthy fats. It has a mild, nutty flavor and can be used in place of wheat flour in baked goods.

2. Coconut flour
Coconut flour  is a type of flour made from coconut meat that has been dried and ground.
Compared with regular flour, coconut flour is  lower in carbs and higher in fiber . According to  researchers , consuming foods that are high in fiber can slow the absorption of sugar in the bloodstream and support better blood sugar management.
It has a slightly sweet flavor. You can use it in a variety of recipes, including many cakes, cookies, muffins, brownies, and breads.
However, remember to adjust your recipes accordingly if you use coconut flour in place of  wheat flour , as it absorbs more liquid and can give foods a dry, gritty texture.
You’ll generally need about 1/4 cup of coconut flour for each cup of regular flour, and you may need to increase the total amount of liquid by the same amount of coconut flour added to the recipe.
Coconut flour is lower in carbs and higher in fiber than regular flour. It has a slightly sweet flavor that works well in baked goods.

3. Chickpea flour
Chickpea flower  is made from dried garbanzo beans that have been ground into a fine powder. It is a common flour substitute for people with diabetes.
Chickpea flour has a  high protein content . According to  researchers , a high protein diet may help prevent  insulin resistance . Insulin resistance is a condition that impairs your body’s ability to regulate blood sugar levels efficiently.
Chickpea flour has a rich, nutty flavor that’s suitable for both sweet and savory recipes like fritters, flatbreads, pancakes, and cookies.
It also has a naturally dense texture and strong binding properties, making it a great vegan and gluten-free substitute for wheat flour.
You’ll generally need slightly less chickpea flour, substituting about half the amount of regular flour with chickpea flour.
Chickpea flour is high in protein, which may help prevent insulin resistance. It has a rich, nutty flavor and dense texture that’s suitable for both sweet and savory foods.

4. Oat flour
Oat flour is a popular whole grain flour made by grinding  rolled oats  until they reach a powder-like consistency.
Oat flour is not only a  good source of fiber and protein  but also contains  beta-glucan . According to  researchers , beta-glucan is a specific type of fiber that has been shown to decrease blood sugar levels in people with diabetes.
Oat flour has a mild, nutty flavor and can help soften baked goods while giving them a chewy, unique texture.
Although you may need to make a few slight adjustments, you can use oat flour in most recipes that call for white flour, including cookies, breads, muffins, and pancakes.
You may need to use slightly more oat flour when substituting it for regular flour. You’ll need to substitute about 1 1/3 cups of oat flour for each cup of regular flour.
Oat flour is high in protein and fiber, including a specific type of fiber called beta-glucan. It has a nutty flavor and can add a soft, chewy texture to baked goods.

5. Spelt flour
Spelt flour  is produced from spelt, a type of ancient grain that’s closely related to wheat.
Spelt flour is  especially rich  in fiber, which  research  has shown can help stabilize blood sugar levels after meals.
Spelt flour has a slightly sweet flavor and light texture that can be used in recipes without weighing down the final product.
It works well as a  flour substitute  in foods like bread, tortillas, muffins, and biscuits.
You can generally substitute spelt flour for regular flour at a 1:1 ratio.
Spelt flour is rich in fiber and has a light texture that can be used in place of white flour in baked goods without weighing them down.

Flours to use less often
Although there are many flour options available for people with diabetes, there are a few types that you may want to use infrequently.
These varieties of flour are very high in carbs. Additionally, they are also low in fiber, protein, or  heart-healthy fats . Thus, they may cause sudden spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels.
Here are a few of the flours you should use less often:
all-purpose flour
corn flour
millet flour
white rice flour
pastry flour
cake flour
Many types of flour are high in carbs and low in fiber, protein, or heart-healthy fats. As such, they may increase your blood sugar levels.

Takeaway
There are plenty of diabetes-friendly flour options you can easily swap into your favorite recipes.
Be sure to look for flour varieties that are low in carbs and  high in fiber , protein, or heart-healthy fats.
You should also consider limiting the use of flours that are high in carbs and low in fiber, as they may cause spikes and crashes in your blood sugar levels.
