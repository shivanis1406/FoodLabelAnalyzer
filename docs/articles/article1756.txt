Title: 14 of the Best Oat Milk Products

Oat milk is popping up at coffee shops and grocery stores alike, quickly becoming one of the trendiest plant-based milks.
In its simplest form, it’s made by soaking oats, blending them with water, and straining out the oats. Many companies add ingredients like sweeteners, oils, thickeners, and stabilizers to alter the product’s taste, texture, and shelf life. These are often necessary to create an appealing product.

The Swedish company Oatly, considered the original oat milk manufacturer, has become increasingly popular in the United States.
Its thick, creamy texture, slight sweetness, and versatility for baking and drinking alike make it the best overall option on the market.
Its Original Oatmilk product owes its rich consistency to non-GMO, expeller-pressed  rapeseed oil , also known as canola oil in the United States ( 1 ).
As it’s less processed than most seed oils, this type of rapeseed oil likely retains more of its beneficial nutrients, including  vitamin E  and  omega-3 and -6 fatty acids  ( 2 ,  3 ).
The  vitamin B12  content is particularly notable, as this essential vitamin is sometimes lacking in  vegan and vegetarian diets  ( 5 ). While Oatly doesn’t add sugar to its products, oat milk contains small amounts of natural sugars from oat starches that are broken down during the manufacturing process ( 6 ).
This is true for many other oat milk products on this list.

Its balanced flavor isn’t overly sweet, and its smooth texture resembles that of  soy milk . Thus, it’s great for drinking on its own, as well as for using in cooking and baking.
As you can see, a single serving packs all of your daily vitamin B12 needs. What’s more, its ratio of calcium and vitamin D is similar to what’s found in fortified dairy milk ( 8 ).
While Silk Oatmilk harbors more ingredients and additives than many other products on this list, it’s still one of the best options for the price.

While several oat milk companies claim to be gluten-free, Oatly is currently the only major brand in the United States that’s been  certified gluten-free  by the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO).
What’s more, their low fat oat milk has a relatively short ingredient list that’s free of added gums and thickeners. Unlike other Oatly products, it doesn’t contain added oils.
Unlike Oatly Original Oatmilk, this low fat option is thinner and closer in consistency to low fat dairy milk.

While all types of oats are nutritious, whole grain foods, some people are concerned about  chemical pesticides  and fertilizers used on conventional oat crops ( 10 ,  11 ).
Levels of chemical residues on oats regularly test below the safety limits set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Still, organic oats are less likely to contain high levels of these residues ( 12 ,  13 ).

Pacific Foods is a respected food company that uses as many locally sourced and organic ingredients as possible.
Their organic, reduced sugar oat original plant-based beverage is certified organic and  non-GMO . Additionally, it has a minimal ingredient list that’s free of added sugars.
This organic oat beverage also has a mild, slightly sweet flavor that’s a bit thinner than other oat milk options. As a result, it’s best enjoyed on its own as a beverage or used in cooking and baking.
While one of the lowest sugar options, some reviewers find the beverage to have a slightly gritty texture.

If you like the consistency of 2% milk, Planet Oat Original is a great choice because it’s free of added oils and quite low in natural sugars.
Like Oatly, Planet Oat uses a stabilizer called dipotassium phosphate that the Food and Drug Administration deems safe ( 17 ).
However, frequent intake of foods containing this additive may  harm kidney health , especially in people with pre-existing kidney disease ( 18 ).
While small amounts of dipotassium phosphate shouldn’t be concerning, you may want to choose a different oat milk if you have kidney disease.

Califia Farms Extra Creamy Oatmilk isn’t overly sweet and strikes the right balance between smooth and creamy.
Although this oat milk is free of gums and stabilizers, it’s higher in fat than many other products.
This fat comes from  sunflower oil , which is high in omega-6 fatty acids ( 20 ).
Research suggests that diets high in omega-6s but low in omega-3s may increase chronic inflammation in your body. Over time, this may raise your risk of chronic ailments like heart disease, arthritis, and diabetes ( 21 ,  22 ).
If you choose this oat milk, you may want to limit your intake of other vegetable oils high in omega-6s, such as soybean, safflower, cottonseed, and corn oil ( 23 ).

How to choose a healthy oat milk
When looking for a healthy oat milk product, it’s important to take a look at the ingredient list.
Ideally, opt for a product with a short ingredient list that’s low in both  added sugar  and additives like thickeners, stabilizers, gums, and artificial flavorings and colors.
Keep in mind that many oat milk products contain natural sugars because oats’ starches are broken down by  enzymes  during the manufacturing process ( 31 ).
Finally, if you have a gluten allergy or intolerance, only choose products that are certified gluten-free. While oats are naturally gluten-free, there’s still a risk of cross-contamination with other grains ( 32 ,  33 ).

Benefits and downsides of oat milk
Oat milk is a plant-based milk alternative that has a rich, creamy, slightly sweet taste.
Unlike most other milk alternatives, it’s nut-free — so it’s appropriate for people with  nut allergies .
Unsweetened oat milk can also be a healthy source of naturally occurring carbs, which provide your body with a quick source of energy.
Additionally, oat milk is often fortified with vitamin D, calcium, and other nutrients.
However, many oat milk products are highly processed and may contain gums, stabilizers, and thickeners. Be sure to read ingredients lists if you want to avoid products with lots of additives. However, be aware that some additives are there to fortify the oat milk with important vitamins and minerals.

Cow’s milk vs. oat milk
Oat milk is a suitable alternative to cow’s milk in nearly any recipe, or to drink, add to coffee, or pour over cereal.
However, it does have some key nutritional differences. This is because typical dairy milk comes from cows, while oat milk is a plant-based substitute made from oats.
As such, oat milk tends to be lower in protein and fat than cow’s milk ( 35 ,  36 ). It also tends to be higher in carbohydrates.
While oat milk contains natural sugars, it doesn’t contain  lactose  like cow’s milk does.
Additionally, cow’s milk naturally contains calcium, while oat milk does not. Still, some oat milk products are fortified with calcium and other nutrients, like vitamin D. Cow’s milk is also typically  fortified with vitamin D .
Here’s how 1/2 cup (100 grams) of plain, unsweetened oat milk compares to the same amount of 2% cow’s milk ( 35 ,  36 ):

Frequently asked questions about oat milk
Only sweetened oat milk has added sugar. The sugars that naturally occur in oat milk are not considered added sugars because they come from the oats themselves.
Oat milk is made by blending water with oats, then straining out the oat solids. You can do this at home. However, most manufacturers add oils, stabilizers, and sometimes sweeteners to improve the taste and texture of the final product.
That depends on your preferences and dietary needs. Both almond and oat milk have a distinctive taste. Almond milk is lower in carbs, while oat milk is naturally higher in carbs. Almond milk tends to be thinner and less creamy than oat milk. However, they can both be used in similar ways as a milk alternative.
Neither almond nor oat milk contains much protein naturally. However, some brands contain added protein, calcium, and vitamin D to make them more nutritionally similar to cow’s milk.

The bottom line
Oat milk is a popular plant-based beverage that’s enjoyed for its slightly sweet, oat flavor and creamy consistency.
While numerous options abound, the healthiest ones tend to be low in sugar and additives.
It’s also surprisingly easy and inexpensive to  make oat milk at home .
