Title: 19 Simple Tips to Help You Fall Asleep Quickly

Small changes in your routine may help you fall asleep faster. These might include making the room cooler, practicing the 4-7-8 breathing method, and avoiding screens before bedtime.
Proper sleep is vital for physical and mental well-being. Lack of it may increase your risk of:
cardiovascular disease
type 2 diabetes
obesity
stress ,  anxiety , and  depression
impaired learning, memory, and mood
Adults require around  7 hours  of sleep per 24-hour period, though the recommended hours of sleep may change as you age.

19 strategies for falling asleep faster
If you have difficulty falling or staying asleep, these strategies may help.
A hot sleeping environment may affect  thermoregulation , which is your body’s ability to control internal temperature. This may impact your sleep quality.
When you lie down and prepare for sleep, your body begins to  shed heat  through blood vessel dilation (expansion), which sends a sleep onset signal to your body. Gradually, your core body temperature decreases until waking up again.
Maintaining a room temperature ranging between  60°F and 67°F  (15.6°C and 19.4°C) may help keep  your body temperature low  and help you fall and stay asleep.
A 2019 research review suggests that bathing in warm water  1 to 2 hours  before bedtime may also speed up thermoregulation and help you fall asleep faster. The study also found that people who bathed in water ranging from 104°F to 108.5°F (40.0°C to 42.5°C) for as little as 10 minutes before going to sleep reported higher sleep quality.
The  4-7-8 method  is a cyclical breathing technique that may promote calmness and help you unwind before bed.
Dr. Andrew Weil, an integrative medicine doctor, developed it. The technique is based on  pranayama  exercises in yoga.
Place the tip of your tongue behind your upper front teeth.
Exhale completely through your mouth and make a “whoosh” sound.
Close your mouth and inhale through your nose while mentally counting to 4.
Hold your breath and mentally count to 7.
Open your mouth and exhale completely, making a “whoosh” sound while mentally counting to 8.
Repeat this cycle at least three more times.
A sleep schedule may help you fall asleep faster. Your body has its own near-24-hour regulatory system called the  circadian rhythm . This internal clock cues your body to feel alert during the day but sleepy at night.
The rhythm also has an important role in maintaining  physiological cycles , such as metabolism, thermoregulation, and sleep-wake cycles.
Waking up and going to bed at the same time each day could help regulate this internal clock.
Once your body adjusts to a given schedule, it’ll be easier to fall asleep and wake up around the same time every day.
Research also recommends giving yourself  30 to 45 minutes  to wind down in the evening before getting in bed. This may allow your body and mind to relax and prepare for sleep.
Research published in 2022 indicates that light exposure can  influence  your body’s internal clock, which regulates sleep and wakefulness. It may also help dictate the duration, timing, and quality of your sleep.
Every additional hour you spend outdoors may lead to falling asleep  30 minutes  earlier.
Daylight exposure may also increase evening fatigue and sleep duration and quality. That said, timing is important, as too much evening light exposure may prevent you from falling asleep and hinder melatonin production.  Melatonin  is an essential hormone for sleep that’s produced in darkness.
Therefore, it is important to find a balance between time spent under natural light and in darkness. One way to do this is to expose one’s body to daylight throughout the day and use blackout curtains at night.
Research suggests that yoga may  positively affect  the quality, efficiency, and duration of sleep.
Yoga  involves the practice of breathing patterns and body movements that could release stress and tension in your body.
Mindfulness  may also have a  positive impact  on your stress levels, sleep quality, and cognitive function. It could help you focus on the present, rather than worry about falling asleep.
Waking up in the middle of the night is a natural occurrence, but not being able to fall back asleep may be frustrating.
It’s common for people with  insomnia  to look at their clock every time they wake up. This is known as clock-watching or time-monitoring behavior (TMB), which research suggests may increase brain stimulation and  exacerbate  anxious feelings of sleeplessness.
Removing the clock from your room may help reduce your feelings of sleep-related anxiety. Alternatively, if you need an alarm in the room, you can turn your clock around to avoid looking at it when you wake up during the night.
Lack of sleep at night may lead to daytime napping. While  short naps  may improve alertness and well-being, there’s mixed research about the effects of napping on nighttime sleep.
An older  2016 study  involving 236 healthy high school students suggested that daytime napping leads to shorter nighttime sleep duration, and lower sleep quality and efficiency.
That said, a  2022 literature review  found that daytime naps do not always negatively impact an adult’s nighttime sleep.
To find out if naps are affecting your sleep, try eliminating them altogether or limiting yourself to a 30-minute nap early in the day.
Results from the American Time Use Survey suggest that eating within  1 hour  before bedtime increases your chances of waking up shortly after falling asleep.
Try to space out your meals and eat your last meal of the day at least 2 hours or more before going to bed. If this isn’t possible for you, consider a lighter meal at night.
Research on chronic mental health conditions, including insomnia, suggests that  listening to relaxing music  may help improve sleep onset, quality, and duration. It may also provide  comfort and relaxation  before bedtime, which may, in turn, reduce anxiety.
A systematic review published in 2023 involving hospitalized people suggests that listening to  30 minutes  of relaxing music in the evening significantly increased sleep quality.
If relaxing music is not available, blocking out all noise with  earplugs  may help you fall asleep faster.
It’s important to maintain a moderate-intensity exercise routine and to be mindful of when you exercise.
Working out early in the morning may help establish your circadian rhythm and lead to better sleep in the evening. Contrarily, exercising within  2 hours  before bed may decrease sleep quality, especially if you’re in a gym with bright lights.
Moderate and intense exercise , especially outdoors, may also positively impact your sleep quality.
Some activities that you could do during the day include:
running
hiking
cycling
lifting weights
A comfortable mattress and bedding may have a remarkable effect on the onset, depth, and quality of sleep.
A  medium-firm mattress  has been shown to positively affect sleep quality in people with back pain, and prevent sleep disturbances and muscular discomfort.
Your pillow may also impact your sleep by having an effect on:
neck and spinal curve
pillow and body temperature
comfort
Sleeping with a weighted blanket may also have  numerous benefits , such as:
better sleep quality and duration
more energy for daytime activity
reduced symptoms of anxiety, stress, and depression
Lastly, the  fabric of the clothes  you wear to bed may affect how fast you fall asleep. It’s crucial that you choose comfortable clothing made of fabric that helps you keep a pleasant temperature throughout the night.
Watching TV, playing video games, and  using a smartphone  may make it significantly harder to fall and stay asleep. This is partly because electronic devices emit  blue light , which may  suppress melatonin .
Using these devices also keeps your mind in an active and engaged state.
If you need to use your devices late in the evening, consider using  blue-light glasses  to block out the blue light.
That said, it may help to just disconnect and put away all your electronics at least 1 hour before going to bed. This could help ensure a quiet place, free of distractions.
Aromatherapy  involves the use of essential oils and may help people with trouble falling asleep.
A  systematic review of 30 studies  suggests that aromatherapy may help improve sleep quality and reduce:
stress
pain
anxiety
depression
A variety of different scents, such as  peppermint and lavender , may help improve sleep.
There are also a variety of ways to use essential oils. An essential oil diffuser could be helpful in infusing your room with relaxing scents that encourage sleep.
While research suggests there are health benefits, the FDA doesn’t monitor or regulate the purity or quality of essential oils. It’s important to talk with a healthcare professional before you begin using essential oils and be sure to research the  quality  of a brand’s products. Always do a  patch test  before trying a new essential oil.
Some people may have a difficult time falling asleep because their thoughts keep running in circles.
Journaling  and focusing on positive thoughts may help calm the mind and help you fall asleep faster.
A study found that  writing a to-do list , even just for 5 minutes, was more effective than journaling at helping young adults fall asleep faster.
It may help to set aside 15 minutes every night to write about your day. You may want to focus on the positive events, your upcoming events, and how you feel at the time. If tomorrow’s happenings keep you alert, try drafting a to-do list.
Although the effects of caffeine peak within  30 minutes , it may stay in your system for up to 10 hours after consumption.
Instead, drinking a noncaffeinated  bedtime tea  may help promote sleep and relaxation.
Good quality sleep may depend on your body position during the night.
There are three main  sleeping positions :
back
stomach
side
Traditionally, it was believed that back sleepers (supine) had a better quality of sleep.
However, this might not be the best position to sleep in as it  could lead to  blocked airways,  sleep apnea , and  snoring .
Although individual preferences play an important role in choosing a sleep position, the  side position  may provide the best quality sleep.
Reading a physical book  may have many benefits, including helping you unwind before bed.
One  study  suggests that reading a paper book during the hour before bed may help increase sleep quality, duration, and efficiency. Contrarily, reading from an e-book may impact these sleep factors.
Paradoxical intention (PI) is a sleeping technique that involves intentionally staying awake, rather than forcing yourself to sleep. It’s designed to reduce performance anxiety and stress produced by forcing yourself to fall asleep.
Although the research is mixed, some studies suggest that  PI may help improve  sleep onset, duration, and quality.
Certain supplements may help you fall asleep faster, boost the production of sleep-promoting hormones, or help calm brain activity.
Some of these supplements include:
magnesium
5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan)
melatonin
L-theanine
GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)
Before trying any of these supplements, it’s important to speak with a doctor. Many of them may have side effects or negative interactions with medications.
