Title: 13 Ways to Lower Your Insulin Levels

You may be able to help reduce high insulin levels by making dietary changes and increasing your physical activity.
Insulin  is an extremely important hormone that your pancreas produces. It has many functions, such as allowing your cells to take in sugar from your blood for energy.
However, living with chronically high levels of insulin, also known as  hyperinsulinemia , can lead to high weight gain and serious health conditions, like heart disease and cancer.
High blood insulin levels can also cause your cells to become resistant to the hormone’s effects. This condition, known as insulin resistance, leads to your pancreas producing even more insulin, creating a precarious cycle.
If your doctor has advised you to lower your insulin levels, here are 13 things you can do.

1. Follow a lower carb eating plan
Of the three macronutrients — carbohydrates, protein, and fat — carbs raise blood sugar and insulin levels the most. Even though carbs are an essential part of most balanced, nutritious diets,  lower carb diets  can be very effective for losing weight and  managing diabetes .
Many studies  have confirmed the effectiveness of lower carb eating plans for lowering insulin levels and increasing insulin sensitivity, especially when compared with other diets.
People living with health conditions involving insulin resistance, such as metabolic syndrome and  polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) , may experience a dramatic lowering of insulin with carb restriction, according to a  2020 review .
While carbohydrates are typically an important part of a balanced diet, lower carb diets have been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and reduce insulin levels in people living with obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and PCOS.

2. Consider supplementing with apple cider vinegar
Apple cider vinegar (ACV)  may help prevent insulin and blood sugar spikes after eating, particularly when consumed with high carbohydrate foods.
One  2019 review  found that consuming 2–6 teaspoons (10–30 mL) of vinegar daily appears to improve glycemic response to carbohydrate-rich meals. It’s important to note, however, that this review incorporated studies that used other forms of vinegar in addition to ACV.
Another  2021 review  of studies specifically targeting ACV analyzed its effect on glycemic control in adults.
Researchers found that consuming ACV significantly decreased fasting blood sugar and HbA1C (a measure of blood sugar over time). However, ACV did not seem to affect fasting insulin levels or insulin resistance.
Similarly, a  2023 clinical trial  concluded that daily consumption of ACV may help people with type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar and improve their cholesterol levels.
Vinegar may help ease high blood sugar and insulin levels after meals, particularly when those meals are high in carbs. However, results are mixed and more research is needed — especially around apple cider vinegar in particular.

3. Keep an eye on portion sizes
Your pancreas releases different amounts of insulin depending on the type of food you eat, but eating a large amount of foods that cause your body to produce extra insulin can eventually lead to hyperinsulinemia.
This is of  particular concern  for people who are already living with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and  insulin resistance .
In one small  2017 study , otherwise healthy people classified as having either a “normal” BMI or a higher BMI each ate meals with different glycemic loads for a few days.
Researchers found that while the meals with a higher glycemic load (those with more sugar and carbs) spiked everyone’s blood sugar, the blood sugar of individuals with BMIs in the “obesity” category stayed elevated longer.
Even though calorie restriction has been shown to ease excess insulin levels, it’s a good idea to seek the help of a dietitian or doctor before making any dietary changes to be sure you’re not missing out on any important macro or micronutrients.
Reducing calorie intake can help lower insulin levels in people living with overweight or obesity who have type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome.

4. Lower your intake of all forms of sugar
Sugar  may very well be the most important ingredient to limit and avoid if you’re trying to lower your insulin levels. Diets high in added sugar are associated with insulin resistance and may promote the development of metabolic disease, according to a  2022 review .
In one small  study from 2014 , otherwise healthy adults consumed jams containing varying amounts of sugar. The adults who consumed high sugar jams saw their insulin levels rise significantly compared with those who ate the lower sugar jams .
Fructose is a type of natural sugar  found in :
table sugar
honey
fruit
corn syrup
While some studies have singled out fructose as particularly harmful for blood sugar control and insulin resistance, there’s  not enough evidence  to suggest fructose is more harmful than other types of sugars when consumed in moderate amounts .
Indeed, a  2017 study  found that replacing glucose or sucrose with fructose actually lowered peak post-meal blood sugar and insulin levels, especially in people with prediabetes or type 1 or type 2 diabetes.
A high intake of sugar in any form has been shown to increase insulin levels and promote insulin resistance if consumed for a length of time.

5. Prioritize physical activity
Engaging in regular physical activity can have powerful insulin-lowering effects.
Aerobic  exercise  appears to be very effective at increasing insulin sensitivity in people living with obesity or type 2 diabetes.
One  2021 study  examined how blood vessels respond to insulin in a single exercise session in adults with obesity.
Researchers found that after exercising, participants’ blood vessels responded better to insulin. Researchers also noticed the participants had increased blood flow through the capillaries, their bodies were better at using glucose, and some markers of inflammation went down.
There’s also  research  showing that resistance training can help decrease insulin levels in people with overweight.
More recently, a  2024 study  suggests both aerobic and resistance may be helpful for managing type 2 diabetes, but there’s not a big difference between them in terms of their impact. However, this finding needs to be verified by more high quality studies.
Relatedly, a  2022 review  found that spending more time sitting, especially in front of screens, was linked to a higher risk of metabolic syndrome. The review notes this link is stronger in women than in men.
Overall, increasing your physical activity can  significantly lower  your insulin levels.
Aerobic exercise, strength training, or a combination may help lower insulin levels and increase insulin sensitivity.

6. Try adding cinnamon to foods and beverages
Cinnamon  is a delicious spice loaded with health-promoting antioxidants.
Research  suggests that both individuals living with insulin resistance and those with relatively normal insulin levels who supplement with cinnamon may experience enhanced insulin sensitivity and decreased insulin levels.
One  2021 review  and meta-analysis found that taking cinnamon supplements reduced insulin resistance in women with PCOS.
A  2019 study  notes that improvements in insulin and insulin sensitivity are most pronounced for individuals with higher BMIs.
Similarly, another  2021 review  concludes that cinnamon could be promising for improving the metabolic health of women with PCOS. However, researchers suggest that more clinical trials with higher doses of cinnamon and longer study durations are needed to see whether these improvements lead to meaningful changes in clinical outcomes.
It’s important to note that there is no recommended dose of cinnamon that has been tested across the board, and  not all studies  have found that cinnamon helps lower insulin levels or increases insulin sensitivity.
Cinnamon’s effects may vary from person to person.
Some studies have found that adding cinnamon to foods or beverages lowers insulin levels and increases insulin sensitivity, but results are mixed.

7. When eating carbs, choose complex carbs
While complex carbs are an important part of a nutritious diet, refined or “simple” carbs don’t usually contain a lot of fiber or micronutrients, and the body digests them very quickly.
Refined carbs include simple sugars and grains that have had the fibrous parts removed. Some  examples are :
cereal with added sugar
highly processed foods, such as fast food
foods made with refined flour, like certain breads, pastries, and white rice
Regularly consuming refined carbs  can lead  to several health issues, including high insulin levels and weight gain.
Furthermore, refined carbs have a  high glycemic index (GI) . The GI is a scale that measures a specific food’s capacity to raise blood sugar. Glycemic load takes into account a food’s glycemic index and the amount of digestible carbs contained in a serving.
Some  studies  comparing foods with different glycemic loads have found that eating a food with a high glycemic load raises insulin levels more than eating the same portion of a food with a low glycemic load, even if the carb contents of the two foods are similar.
However,  other studies  comparing high glycemic load and high GI diets with low glycemic load and low GI diets have found no difference in their effects on insulin levels or insulin sensitivity.
Replacing refined carbs, which are digested quickly and can sharply raise blood sugar, with slower digesting complex carbs and whole grains may help lower insulin levels.
Avoiding sitting for prolonged periods and increasing the amount of time you spend walking or doing other moderate activities may help reduce insulin levels.

8. Consider intermittent fasting
Intermittent fasting is an eating plan where you have set hours for eating and set hours for fasting during a 24-hour period. It has been popping up in headlines recently, specifically around its possible weight loss benefits.
Research suggests intermittent fasting may help reduce insulin levels as effectively as or more effectively than daily calorie restriction.
For example, a  2019 study  compared alternate-day fasting with calorie restriction in adults with overweight or obesity and insulin resistance.
Those using alternate-day fasting for 12 months had greater reductions in fasting insulin and insulin resistance than those who restricted their calorie intake, as well as those in the control group.
That said, a more recent  2023 review  concludes there’s very little evidence that intermittent fasting is more effective than daily calorie restriction for insulin sensitivity.
Although many people find intermittent fasting beneficial and enjoyable, it doesn’t work for everyone and may cause problems in some people. A doctor or dietitian can help you figure out whether intermittent fasting is right for you and how to do it safely.
Intermittent fasting may help reduce insulin levels. However, more research is needed, and this way of eating may not suit everyone.

9. Increase soluble fiber intake
Soluble fiber  provides a number of health benefits, including aiding in weight loss and  reducing blood sugar levels .
After you eat, the soluble fiber in food absorbs water and forms a gel, which  slows  the movement of food through your digestive tract. This promotes feelings of fullness and keeps your blood sugar and insulin from rising too quickly after a meal.
Soluble fiber also helps feed the friendly bacteria that live in your colon, which  may improve  gut health and reduce insulin resistance.
In a  6-week study  involving postmenopausal women with obesity, those who took  flax seed  (which contains soluble fiber) experienced greater increases in insulin sensitivity and lower insulin levels than those who took a probiotic or placebo.
Overall, fiber from whole foods appears to be more effective at reducing insulin than fiber in supplement form, although results are mixed. One  2015 study  found that insulin decreased when people consumed black beans but not when they took a fiber supplement.
Soluble fiber, especially from whole foods, has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and lower insulin levels, particularly in people living with obesity or type 2 diabetes.

10. Concentrate on weight loss, if advised
The distribution of fat throughout your body is  determined by  your age, sex hormones, and genetic variation.
An overabundance of belly fat — also known as visceral or abdominal fat — in particular is linked to many health issues. Visceral fat  can promote  inflammation and insulin resistance, which drives hyperinsulinemia.
A  2023 study  found that visceral fat worsens insulin sensitivity independent of a person’s BMI and subcutaneous fat.
There’s no way to specifically target visceral fat when losing weight. However, visceral fat loss is linked to subcutaneous fat loss, so when you lose weight in general, you’ll likely also lose visceral fat.
Furthermore,  studies  show that when you lose weight, you lose a higher percentage of visceral fat than fat throughout the rest of your body.
If your doctor has advised you to lose weight, talk with them about the best weight loss program for you.
If your doctor advises you to do so, losing visceral fat can increase insulin sensitivity and help reduce your insulin levels. While you can’t target visceral fat specifically, when you lose weight overall, you lose visceral fat as well.

11. Incorporate green tea into your diet
Green tea  contains high amounts of an antioxidant known as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which  may help  fight insulin resistance.
In a  2016 study , postmenopausal women living with obesity and high insulin levels who took green tea extract experienced a small decrease in insulin over 12 months, while those who took a placebo had increased insulin levels following the intervention.
In a  2013 review , researchers reported that green tea appeared to significantly lower fasting insulin levels in high quality studies.
However, there are  other high quality studies  on green tea supplementation that have not shown a reduction in insulin levels or increased insulin sensitivity.
Several studies have found that green tea may increase insulin sensitivity and decrease insulin levels, but results are mixed.

12. Eat more fatty fish
There are many reasons to consume fatty fish like salmon, sardines, mackerel, herring, and anchovies. They provide  high quality  protein and are some of the best sources of long-chain omega-3 fats, which offer  many health benefits .
Studies have shown that the omega-3s in fatty fish may also help reduce insulin resistance in people living with  obesity ,  gestational diabetes , and  PCOS .
According to the  Dietary Guidelines for Americans , adults can safely consume at least 8 ounces of seafood per week (based on a 2,000-calorie diet). Young children should eat less.
Meanwhile, people who are pregnant or breastfeeding should eat 8–12 ounces of a variety of seafood per week, choosing options that are lower in mercury.
While eating fish is typically recommended over taking supplements for a variety of reasons (more omega-3s aren’t always better, and fish has additional nutrients and vitamins), fish oil supplements are sold widely in stores and are often used in studies.
These supplements contain the same long-chain omega-3 fats as the fish itself, but the effective dosage has  not yet  been determined.
Despite the need for more research, fish oil has been shown to support healthy blood sugar.
A  2021 review  demonstrates that omega-3 supplementation has a significant effect on the reduction of fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance.
The long-chain omega-3s in fatty fish may help reduce insulin resistance and insulin levels, especially in those with metabolic disorders. While fish oil supplements are sold widely and often used in studies, the effective dosing has not yet been determined.

13. Get the right amount and type of protein
Consuming  adequate protein  at meals can be beneficial for controlling your weight and insulin levels.
In a small  study from 2015 , premenopausal women with obesity had lower insulin levels after consuming a high protein breakfast compared with a low protein breakfast. They also felt fuller and ate fewer calories at lunch.
However, protein stimulates insulin production so your muscles can take up amino acids. Therefore, eating very high protein amounts over a prolonged period  may lead  to higher insulin levels in otherwise healthy individuals.
Two studies, one from  2018  and another from  2019 , sheds some light on these diverging results: When it comes to protein, dietary patterns are important.
For instance, researchers found that individuals who ate a majority of plant proteins were less likely to develop type 2 diabetes, while individuals who ate a lot of protein in the form of red meat had a greater likelihood of having or developing type 2 diabetes.
So while protein is important, eating a variety of protein that’s not overly processed and is nutrient-dense is even more important.
Eating a variety of nutritious protein sources may help with insulin sensitivity, but moderation is key.

Frequently asked questions
Below are some commonly asked questions about lowering insulin levels.
If you have diabetes, you require  more fluid  when blood glucose levels are high. Drinking water enables more glucose to be flushed out of the blood.
However, drinking water won’t directly lower your insulin. Rather, it helps keep your blood sugar levels stable and makes your body better at using insulin.
If your insulin levels are high,  try to limit  foods with a high glycemic index (GI), as they increase your blood sugar.
Generally speaking, foods that have a GI  include :
potatoes
breakfast cereals
white rice
carbonated drinks

Bottom line
If your doctor has advised you to find ways to lower your insulin levels, they will most likely have a plan to help you accomplish that goal.
Eating fewer refined carbs and sugars, eating more fibrous and nutrient-dense foods, getting enough exercise, and occasionally supplementing with natural helpers like green tea and cinnamon can help you get on track and stay there until you reach that goal.
