Wegovy (semaglutide), a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, was first  approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  for help with chronic weight management and to be used in addition to regular exercise and a reduced calorie diet.
In March 2024, the FDA approved another  use for Wegovy : to “reduce the risk of cardiovascular health, heart attack, and stroke in adults with cardiovascular disease and either obesity or overweight.”
Wegovy  has become a popular tool for both weight loss and  reducing risk of cardiovascular disease , and the cost can be steep. As a result, many other companies have started producing their own compounded medications that include semaglutide.
If you’re on the weight-loss journey and considering a weight loss injection, here are some things to keep in mind about getting Wegovy online. We also provide some accredited and trusted online platforms that offer brand-name Wegovy.

WEGOVY IS FOR LONG-TERM USE
LEARN ABOUT HOW IT WORKS
People who are interested in taking Wegovy should understand that this medication is meant for long-term use and isn’t approved for rapid weight loss.
Most people need to continue using Wegovy indefinitely to maintain results.
Studies  show that when people stop taking Wegovy, they’re likely to regain most of the weight they lost while taking it. People interested in taking Wegovy should consider this commitment, as well as the cost that comes with long-term medication use, before using it.
It’s important to discuss with a trusted healthcare professional any reservations you may have about taking Wegovy, including its potential risks and  side effects .

Where to get Wegovy online and in-person
Wegovy is a prescription-only medication. This means you must get a prescription from a licensed healthcare professional, such as a doctor or nurse practitioner, to access it.
Once you have a prescription for Wegovy, you can fill it at your local pharmacy or through a  reputable online pharmacy .
To get a prescription, you can meet with a licensed healthcare professional either in person or virtually.
The best way to get a prescription for Wegovy is by making an appointment with a doctor, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. In addition to a better chance of insurance coverage, compared with online programs, in-person visits allow you to establish a relationship with a professional who can support your weight loss efforts long term.
During your visit, your healthcare professional will likely review your medical history, perform a physical exam, and discuss your current lifestyle to determine whether Wegovy is right for you.
In addition to potentially writing a prescription, they can also discuss other resources to support your  weight loss journey , such as a referral to a registered dietitian.
If you prefer the convenience of online consultations and pharmacies, you may be able to get Wegovy through a telehealth company.
Keep in mind that it’s important to choose a reputable telehealth provider.  Dr. Philip Ngo , a pharmacist in Houston, Texas, recommends keeping an eye on the process your prescriber uses while evaluating you for Wegovy. “Are they just prescribing GLP-1s to anyone who asks, or is there a formal workup that looks at BMI, lifestyle habits, etc. for more comprehensive care?”
You’ll also want to consider whether you’re looking to simply meet with a licensed healthcare professional, or if you want the support of a more comprehensive online weight loss program.
Below are a couple online options that passed our rigorous  vetting process .

Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We evaluate services for consistency with standards of care and best practices, and we look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the services on this page, we considered all the GLP-1 services that passed our vetting process. Then, we looked at availability, cost, and the additional resources each service provides to narrow down our list even further.
All the options above offer Wegovy to  eligible individuals . It’s ultimately up to a qualified healthcare professional to determine whether Wegovy is right for you.
Ngo mentions that availability of Wegovy could be difficult because the drug is so popular. “ Supply chain issues  may arise from time to time. Novo Nordisk is actively working to ramp up production,” but there may be difficulty in getting a prescription.
As a result, your healthcare professional may recommend an  alternative  to Wegovy. These alternatives may include compounded versions of injectable  GLP-1 receptor agonist  medications, including tirzepatide and semaglutide.
Because of  safety concerns , the FDA doesn’t approve  compounded versions  of injectable GLP-1s and, in fact, warns against them. It’s important to talk with your healthcare professional to make sure you’re being prescribed FDA-approved, non-compounded GLP-1 medications.

What to expect (and ask) at your initial appointment
According to  Dr. Janelle Duah , assistant professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine, expect to discuss the following at your initial visit:
your weight and dieting history
your weight loss goals
your current diet and exercise routine
your sleep habits
your mood and stress levels
Your healthcare professional will determine whether you’re eligible for Wegovy or another weight loss medication. But it’s also important to come prepared with questions about whether these medications might be a good fit.
Ngo recommends researching the healthcare professionals and their areas of expertise, especially if you’re meeting online. “I would shy away from an online platform that only lists the board members and none of the actual providers.”
Ngo and Duah both recommend that people should come informed about Wegovy or GLP-1-based weight loss treatment.
Wegovy needs to be taken long term to maintain weight loss results. So, it may not be a good weight loss option for you if you have difficulty with injections.
“Patients should be aware of side effects, how to manage the side effects, [and] when to consider stopping the medication if they have side effects,” Duah said.
“They should also make sure that there is good follow-up and accountability with the provider with whom they are working, and that there isn’t just a plan for weight loss but also for maintenance,” Ngo added.
Ngo said it’s important to keep in mind, “GLP-1s may not always be the optimal treatment for someone, so a provider that offers multiple options will offer greater care than the one that solely pushes GLP-1s.”

How does Wegovy work?
GLP-1 receptors are a naturally occurring hormone your body produces. These hormones regulate appetite.
Wegovy’s active ingredient is semaglutide, a type of  GLP-1 receptor agonist . GLP-1 agonists work by activating receptors for GLP-1, making your appetite more sparse. Wegovy is  94% similar  to the GLP-1 hormone that your body naturally produces.
Semaglutide is also the main active ingredient in another GLP-1 agonist medication, Ozempic. However, unlike Wegovy,  Ozempic  is not approved by the FDA for weight loss.
Although Wegovy’s exact effect on the brain is unknown,  researchers  think the medication targets certain areas in the brain to help reduce appetite and increase feelings of fullness. This helps people eat fewer calories, which encourages weight loss.
Wegovy is injected once per week. The  recommended dose  is 2.4 milligrams (mg) once per week. However, it’s generally recommended that new users gradually work up to 2.4 mg over 16 to 20 weeks to reduce the risk of  digestive side effects , such as diarrhea and vomiting.

What are the requirements to qualify for Wegovy?
According to NovoCare, Wegovy’s manufacturer, a healthcare professional may prescribe Wegovy to adults with:
a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more
a BMI of 27 or more and a weight-related medical condition, such as  high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels  or high blood pressure
Wegovy is also approved for the treatment of  obesity in adolescents  ages 12 years and older.
Most healthcare professionals will not prescribe Wegovy or other weight loss medications unless you’ve had difficulty losing weight in the past through traditional methods, such as following a lower calorie diet and being more active.
To be effective, Wegovy should be paired with a nutritious, reduced-calorie  diet  and increased physical activity.
As of  March 2024 , Wegovy is approved to help reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular death in people with heart disease and either overweight or obesity. It is still only obtainable by prescription. Speak with your healthcare provider to see if Wegovy could be helpful for you.
Wegovy and other semaglutide-based medications are not safe for everyone.
Wegovy  may not be appropriate  for people who:
have a personal or family history of a type of thyroid cancer called  medullary thyroid carcinoma
are pregnant, nursing, or  trying to get pregnant
have a history of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2
have  diabetic retinopathy
have medical conditions that affect the kidneys and pancreas
Because Wegovy interacts with certain medications, it’s important to talk with your healthcare professional about the types of medications you’re already taking before you start Wegovy.

How much does Wegovy cost per month?
The current out-of-pocket  cost  for a month’s supply of Wegovy is  $1,349.02 . However, the list price does not always reflect how much you will pay.
The table below summarizes the approximate costs of a month’s supply of Wegovy.
Keep in mind that Wegovy is meant to be used for long-term weight management, and many people will need to stay on Wegovy for years to maintain weight loss. This means people taking Wegovy may have to spend a significant amount of money on the medication every year.
Insurance companies aren’t required to cover  weight loss medications . This means that weight loss drugs like Wegovy are often excluded from health insurance coverage.
But every policy is different, and some insurance companies may cover some of the cost. Check with your insurance provider for more details.
While insurance may not be accepted, you may be able to take advantage of savings offers from the Wegovy manufacturer.
Using the  WeGoTogether  savings offer from Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Wegovy, people with health insurance coverage may pay as little as $0 per 28-day supply of Wegovy, and people paying out-of-pocket can save up to $500 per 28-day supply of Wegovy.
However, you’re not eligible for these savings offers if your insurance coverage comes from Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare, or another government-affiliated healthcare plan.

Research has shown that adults with obesity who use semaglutide (Wegovy) every day lose an average of  9.6% to 17.4%  of their initial body weight after 68 weeks (a little over 15 months). However, it’s worth noting that some of the authors of this research received grants from Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Wegovy, for other research they conducted in the past. Keep in mind that Wegovy isn’t meant to produce rapid weight loss. It’s a chronic weight management medication, which means you may have to use it for several months before you start seeing results. Also, you’ll need to continue using it long term to maintain the results.

The main difference between the two are what the FDA has approved them for.  “While Wegovy and Ozempic both contain semaglutide, Wegovy is FDA-approved for weight loss whereas Ozempic is approved for blood sugar control,” Ngo said.
“The reason for differences in approvals ultimately comes down to the clinical trials done on these drugs and their different strengths. Wegovy comes in 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.7, and 2.4 mg. Meanwhile, Ozempic can give a 0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2 mg dosage.
“When trials were done on these drugs, researchers used the dosages unique to each drug and were looking for different results (Wegovy trials looked at extent of weight loss whereas Ozempic trials looked at extent of glycemic control).”

The bottom line
Wegovy is a prescription-only medication, which means you have to get a prescription from a licensed healthcare professional, such as a physician or nurse practitioner, to use it.
A healthcare professional may prescribe Wegovy for you if you’ve had trouble losing weight in the past through traditional methods, such as increasing physical activity and reducing your calorie intake.
However, Wegovy isn’t appropriate or safe for everyone. And you’ll need to keep taking Wegovy to maintain your weight loss, which can be extremely expensive.
If you’re interested in taking a weight loss medication like Wegovy, the first step is making an appointment with a trusted healthcare professional to discuss your options.
