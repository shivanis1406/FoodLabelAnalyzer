Title: 9 Great Substitutes for Potato Starch

Potato starch is a versatile ingredient made by crushing potatoes to extract the starch. When you’re using potato starch, you’re using the dried and ground potatoes in the form of a fine powder.
Potato starch is featured in a variety of recipes as a thickener, gluten-free flour substitute, and coating for fried foods.
However, if you don’t have any potato starch on hand, you can swap in several other ingredients.
Here are 9 simple and effective substitutes for potato starch.

1. Cornstarch
Often used as a thickener, an anticaking agent, and a  gluten-free baking staple , cornstarch is one of the best substitutes for potato starch when you’re in a pinch.
You can use cornstarch in place of potato starch in a 1:1 ratio. This works especially well in soups, sauces, and gravies.
You can also add it to  baked goods  such as cookies and cakes to achieve a crumbly and tender texture.
However, keep in mind that cornstarch doesn’t handle high temperatures as well as potato starch, so it may not be the best choice for recipes that use high heat cooking methods.
Cornstarch can be used in place of potato starch in baked goods or foods such as soups, sauces, and gravies.

2. Tapioca starch
Tapioca starch, also sometimes called  tapioca flour,  is an ingredient extracted from the roots of the cassava plant.
It’s widely used in gluten-free recipes for breads, pancakes, and pizza crusts and to thicken puddings, pie fillings, and soups.
If you use it in small amounts as a thickener, you can swap potato starch for an equal amount of tapioca starch.
However, for baked goods, you may need to increase the amount of tapioca starch by 25–50% and adjust the amounts of other dry ingredients in your recipe accordingly.
Additionally, keep in mind that using large amounts of tapioca starch can cause baked goods to become chewy or sticky, so it may work better when paired with other types of flour.
Tapioca starch works well as a thickener. You can also use it in place of potato starch in baked goods, but you may need to adjust the ratio of your recipe.

3. Arrowroot powder
Arrowroot  powder is a common ingredient used to improve the thickness and texture of soups, stews, sauces, and jellies.
Because it’s virtually flavorless and colorless, arrowroot powder is a versatile option for your cooking and baking needs. You can use it in place of potato starch in a wide variety of recipes.
However, using arrowroot in place of potato starch can slightly change the flavor of your final product. Arrowroot powder is also a bit drier than potato starch, so you may need to use a smaller amount.
The general recommendation is to use 2 teaspoons (5 grams) of arrowroot powder for each tablespoon (10 grams) of potato starch.
Arrowroot powder boasts a neutral flavor and can be used instead of potato starch to thicken foods. However, you should use it in smaller amounts, as it may change the taste of certain dishes.

4. Rice flour
Rice flour is a gluten-free flour made from finely milled white or brown rice.
It boasts a mild, neutral flavor and is often used as a thickener or flour substitute in many gluten-free baked goods.
The thickening properties of  rice flour  may not prove as strong as those of potato starch. Rice flour is also heavier than other substitutes, such as arrowroot powder and tapioca starch.
Additionally, you may find that it has a gritty texture, which may not be suitable for all recipes.
As a general rule, use about 2 tablespoons (20 grams) of rice flour for each cup (237 mL) of liquid in your recipe.
Rice flour is often used as a thickener and flour substitute. It has a gritty texture and is relatively heavy, so it might not work well in all recipes.

5. Mochiko flour

You can use it to make a batter for fried foods. It also works great in baked recipes.
You may need to use about twice the amount of  wheat  flour when using it as a substitute for potato starch.
Additionally, note that wheat flour is not gluten-free, so it may not be suitable if you have celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity.
Wheat flour is a versatile ingredient that can be used in place of potato starch when frying, baking, or thickening foods. However, it’s not gluten-free and may need to be used in larger amounts than potato starch.

7. Potato flour
Unlike potato starch, which is produced by extracting the starch from potatoes, potato flour is made from whole  potatoes  that have been peeled, trimmed, dried, and ground into flour.
Potato flour can be used in place of potato starch at a 1:1 ratio for certain recipes, including breads, pizza crusts, and soups.
However, it has an earthy flavor that is quite different from that of potato starch, so it’s best to use in savory dishes rather than pastries or sweets.
