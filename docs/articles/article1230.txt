Title: SuperBeets Review: Powerful Powder or Fad?

Because SuperBeets is made from dehydrated beets, it may provide benefits similar to those of beetroot juice, which may include lower blood pressure and improved athletic performance.
Countless supplements claim to improve health and provide powerful benefits, but it’s often debatable whether they’re all they’re advertised to be.
SuperBeets is a popular supplement that allegedly lowers blood pressure, improves circulation, and increases energy.
This article provides a detailed look at SuperBeets and its effectiveness.

What is SuperBeets?
SuperBeets is a supplement made from beets that are dehydrated into crystals.
Beets  are high in nitrates that your body converts into  nitric oxide .
Nitric oxide may have several health benefits, such as protecting your cells from damage and relaxing your blood vessels. As a result, it may help decrease blood pressure and improve circulation ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
SuperBeets is intended to provide the benefits of nitric oxide without making people drink beet juice or eat beets.
HumanN, the company that created SuperBeets, was founded by credible scientists who are known leaders in nitric oxide research.
The patented technology they use to manufacture SuperBeets supposedly preserves nitrates in the beets to deliver the most nitric oxide possible.
HumanN claims that 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of SuperBeets contains the same amount of nitric oxide as three whole beets, though a quantifiable measurement of nitric oxide isn’t provided.
In addition to nitric oxide, 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of  SuperBeets  has:
Calories:  15
Fat:  0 grams
Carbohydrates:  4 grams
Protein:  1 gram
Sodium:  65 mg, or 3% of the Daily Value (DV)
Potassium:  160 mg, or 5% of the DV
Magnesium:  10 mg, or 2% of the DV
Vitamin C:  50 mg, or 83% of the DV
The original flavor product is made from non-GMO, U.S.-grown beets and also contains beetroot powder, natural apple flavor, malic acid (an additive made from apples), magnesium ascorbate, and stevia leaf.
The black cherry product swaps natural apple flavor for natural black cherry flavor but is otherwise identical.
Consumers are instructed to drink 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of SuperBeets mixed with water every day for improved energy, circulation, and blood pressure and not exceed more than 2 servings in 24 hours.
There are no recommendations for how long to take the supplement.
SuperBeets can be purchased from HumanN’s website, Amazon, Whole Foods, or Fresh Thyme Farmers Market.
SuperBeets is a supplement made from powdered beets that supposedly improves circulation and lowers blood pressure due to the nitrates it contains.

Does it lower blood pressure?
The prominent health claim regarding SuperBeets is its potential to lower blood pressure.
This claim is mostly based on research on beetroot juice.
Only one study exists on SuperBeets powder itself, which HumanN, the manufacturer of the powder, funded ( 4 ).
Since SuperBeets shares nitrates and many nutrients with beetroot juice, it may help lower blood pressure just as the juice does.
However, since research on the supplement is lacking, it’s difficult to assess SuperBeets’ benefits.
Nevertheless, studies examining beetroot juice, nitrates, and blood pressure are promising ( 5 ).
A small, controlled study found that healthy adults who drank approximately 5 ounces (140 mL) of nitrate-rich beetroot juice had significantly lower blood pressure 3 hours later, compared to those whose juice had no nitrates ( 6 ).
A 2017 review that included 43 randomized studies found that supplementation with beetroot juice was associated with significantly lower levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
The average difference was −3.55 and −1.32 mmHg, respectively, when compared with placebo treatments ( 7 ).
Another study divided 18 men with normal blood pressure into four groups that received  water  or one of three beetroot juices of varying concentrations ( 8 ).
The results showed that each type of juice led to significantly lower diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number of a blood pressure reading) 24 hours after consumption, compared to water ( 8 ).
What’s more, the most concentrated beetroot juice led to the most significant reductions in blood pressure ( 8 ).
Finally, in another study, the systolic blood pressure of healthy adults who drank 17 ounces (500 mL) of beetroot juice dropped significantly 24 hours later, compared to those who drank water ( 9 ).
These studies suggest that beetroot juice may lower blood pressure by increasing blood levels of  nitrates . However, the studies are small, focused mostly on healthy adults, and use different doses and variations of juice.
The only existing study on SuperBeets examined 13 healthy, older adults and the manufacturer funded it. The results showed that taking a daily serving of the powder in water for 4 weeks reduced systolic blood pressure ( 4 ).
Countless testimonials exist from those who have seen improvements in their blood pressure after taking SuperBeets. However, some individuals report no benefit.
More research is needed to better understand the effect of SuperBeets.
Research suggests that beetroot juice increases blood nitrate levels and lowers blood pressure. SuperBeets may have the same effect, but more independent studies are needed.

Other possible benefits of SuperBeets
SuperBeets may offer additional benefits related to nitrates and other beet compounds.
Research shows that beets may promote  heart health .
One study found that 72% of participants who had high triglycerides and took a HumanN nitrate supplement for 30 days experienced significantly lower triglyceride levels.
Again, this study was funded by the manufacturer — then called Neogenis Labs Inc. ( 10 ).
If SuperBeets provides the same level of nitrates as this supplement, it may decrease triglycerides in your blood and reduce your risk for heart disease.
However, the amount of nitrates in SuperBeets is unknown and not listed on the product.
Additional research shows that beets are rich in antioxidant pigments called betalains, which may help protect against cellular damage and prevent the oxidation of LDL (bad) cholesterol, a main cause of heart disease ( 11 ,  12 ).
Since SuperBeets is a dehydrated form of beets, it may have a high concentration of betalains and therefore provide similar benefits. However, the company doesn’t provide the betalain content of the product.
Compounds in beets may help protect against  cancer .
A test-tube study found that a compound in beetroot extract decreased the growth of prostate cancer cells by 12.5% in 1 week ( 13 ).
When combined with a common anticancer drug, this same compound increased the effectiveness of the drug against prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancer cells ( 14 ).
In addition, an animal study on rats found that water containing beetroot-derived food coloring reduced the development of esophageal cancer by 45% ( 15 ).
The cancer-fighting effects of beetroot have only been shown in test-tube and animal studies. Human studies are needed, as well as specific research on SuperBeets.
The nitrates in beetroot may enhance athletic performance by improving blood flow, lowering blood pressure, and decreasing the amount of oxygen your body needs during  exercise  ( 16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  19 ).
One small study in 9 healthy men found that drinking approximately 2 cups (473 mL) of beetroot juice per day significantly improved oxygen utilization and increased time to exhaustion during walking and running exercises ( 20 ).
Additional research in 14 competitive male swimmers found that drinking the same amount of beetroot juice daily for 6 days significantly decreased the amount of aerobic energy used during a swimming test ( 21 ).
If beetroot juice’s ability to enhance athletic performance is due to its nitrate content, SuperBeets may provide similar benefits — though definitive studies are lacking.
Nitrates and other compounds in beets may help prevent heart disease, fight cancer, and improve athletic performance. More research is needed to determine whether SuperBeets has similar effects.

Dosage and side effects
The manufacturers of SuperBeets recommend taking 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of the powder in a glass of water each day.
Though HumanN claims the nitrate content equals that of 3 beets, the actual amount of nitrates isn’t provided.
Therefore, it’s unclear how SuperBeets compares to the doses of beetroot juice used in studies.
Though the supplement appears to be safe at the recommended dose, no studies exist on its safety or side effects.
The most common criticism of the product is its displeasing taste.
SuperBeets may also prove expensive for regular users. A 150-gram canister of 30 servings costs $39.95.
Because of its potential to lower blood pressure, those on blood-pressure-lowering medications should speak with their doctor before taking SuperBeets.
The recommended daily serving of SuperBeets is 1 teaspoon (5 grams) mixed with water. The product appears to be safe, but no research on its safety exists. Possible downsides of the supplement include its taste and price.

The bottom line
Beetroot juice may help lower blood pressure and improve athletic performance. As SuperBeets is made from dehydrated beets, it may provide similar benefits.
However, the only human study on its effectiveness was funded by the manufacturer.
While the product appears safe, more independent research is needed to verify health claims.
If you’re interested in trying SuperBeets, talk with your healthcare provider first.
