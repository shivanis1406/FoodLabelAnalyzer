Title: The 10 Best Herbs to Boost Energy and Focus

Some herbs like ashwagandha and ginseng may help boost energy when pared with a balanced diet, exercise, and quality sleep. However, more research is needed to support these possible benefits.
The most important factors for energy and mental focus are getting enough sleep, eating a well-balanced diet, and exercising for at least  150 minutes  weekly.
Some  research  suggests that several herbal supplements may help boost your energy and cognitive health.
However, many herbs can interact with commonly prescribed medications and may cause other side effects. It’s important to speak with a healthcare professional before using any herbs for energy.
Keep reading to learn more about 10 herbs that may help boost alertness and energy levels.
Although some research suggests that taking herbal supplements may have health benefits, the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  doesn’t standardize supplement dosages, nor do they monitor any claims made by manufacturers.
It’s important to talk with a healthcare professional before using herbal supplements and consider researching the quality of a brand’s products.

1. Ginseng
Ginseng  is a popular herbal supplement known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and energy-boosting properties.
A  2018 review  found it may stimulate brain function, making it a sought-after herb for improving sports and mental performance. Panax ginseng is the most studied type in human trials.
Ginseng contains compounds like ginsenosides, eleutherosides, and ciwujianosides which are thought to give it its performance- and energy-enhancing effects.
Supplementing with ginseng may also help improve physical performance, reduce fatigue, and boost mental alertness.
Doses of  200 milligrams per day  have been associated with beneficial effects in adults.
It’s important to note that ginseng may have potential side effects, such as:
insomnia
diarrhea
increase  heart rate
increase  blood pressure
Plus, ginseng may interfere with common medications, such as those for diabetes, depression, and heart disease.

2. Sage
Sage  (Salvia) may have cognitive-enhancing effects that could help boost energy, focus, and memory.
A small  2021 study  found that sage helped boost reaction time, perceived exertion, and memory in 26 cyclists.
The study authors also noted in their review of research that sage supplements may help improve mood, alertness, attention, memory, and word recall.
Sage may  also act  as an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. This enzyme breaks down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in brain function.
AChE inhibitors help increase the availability of acetylcholine in the brain, which may help boost cognitive function.
It’s important to note that studies examining the effects of sage have looked at high amounts of sage in supplements rather than small amounts of the herb when cooking.

3. Guarana
Guarana  is commonly used as an ingredient in energy drinks and supplements due to its stimulating effects.
Guana, which comes from the P. cupana seed, may have more  caffeine  than coffee. Research shows that the P. cupana seed has a concentration of  2% to 8%  of caffeine, while coffee beans have 1 to 3%.
The seeds are also great sources of theophylline and theobromine, two energy-boosting compounds.
While human studies have found mixed results, other studies have shown that drinking guarana tea or supplementing with it may help boost attention, alertness, and memory performance.
However, the effects are usually short-term.
It’s also important to be aware of possible side effects of consuming too much guana, which may  include :
increased heart rate
tremors
agitation
confusion
dehydration
high blood pressure

4. Bacopa monnieri
Bacopa monnieri is a plant that grows in wet, marshy areas throughout South Asia. It’s used in Ayurvedic medicine to  help improve :
memory
sleep
epilepsy
anxiety
According to a  2023 review , several studies have found that Bacopa monnieri may also help improve word recall and verbal learning.
The cognitive-enhancing effects of Bacopa monnieri are attributed to its concentration of triterpenoid saponins, which are known as bacosides and have neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing properties.
Bacopa monnieri is generally considered safe, but it may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and more frequent bowel movements.
The FDA doesn’t monitor or regulate the purity or quality of  essential oils . It’s important to talk with a healthcare professional before you begin using essential oils and be sure to research the  quality  of a brand’s products. Always do a patch test before trying a new essential oil.

5. Peppermint
Peppermint oil is a popular  aromatherapy .
Some  animal and human studies  suggest that inhaling the aroma of  peppermint essential oil , a hybrid of spearmint (Mentha spicata) and water mint (Mentha aquatica), may help boost energy and mental alertness.
However,  the  National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)  advises that more research is needed to support the use of  peppermint oil for cognitive function.
You can try adding a few drops of peppermint essential oil to a diffuser or steam bowl.
Peppermint essential oil has a good safety profile. However, some  gastrointestinal side effects  like heartburn, nausea, and stomach pain may be possible when taking peppermint oil by mouth.

6. Rosemary
Like peppermint, the aroma of  rosemary essential oil  may help improve cognitive performance.
According to a  2020 review , some rodent studies found that rosemary oil has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties that may help improve memory, learning, and cognition.
Some human studies also found that exposure to rosemary oil may improve performance on cognitive tasks that involve speed, recollection, and accuracy.
The review authors note this might benefit older adults and protect against neurodegenerative conditions like  Alzheimer’s disease . However, they conclude that more research is needed to fully understand the role of rosemary in cognition.

7. Rhodiola rosea
Rhodiola rosea  is a plant that has been used for centuries in traditional medicine systems worldwide to  help improve  memory, alertness, and endurance, among others.
It has been shown to help reduce mental fatigue and stress, as well as boost brain function, mood, and exercise performance in  human  and  animal  studies.
A  2017 study  in 118 people with burnout found that supplementing with 400 mg of  Rhodiola rosea extract daily for 12 weeks significantly improved feelings of exhaustion, impaired concentration, and lack of joy, compared with their baseline.
Some possible side effects may  include  dizziness, headache, and dry mouth.

8. Ashwagandha
Ashwagandha  is a plant that’s been used as an Ayurvedic remedy since ancient times. According to the  NCCIH , it contains compounds called withanolides, which may have anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties.
A  2019 review  found that supplementing with ashwagandha was well tolerated and led to improved performance on cognitive tasks, attention, and reaction time.
Similarly, a 12-week study in 50 older adults showed that taking  600 mg  of ashwagandha root extract daily improved sleep quality, mental alertness, and overall quality of life.
Despite these positive findings, it’s important to note that more research is needed to fully support the cognitive benefits of ashwagandha.
Some possible side effects may  include  diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting.

9. Centella asiatica (gotu kola)
Gotu kola  has been used in traditional medicine systems to help improve brain function, alertness, and mood, but the research is mixed.
For instance, a  2007 study  in 28 older adults who received doses of 250 to 750 mg of gotu kola extract daily found that those taking the highest dose experienced improvements in working memory, alertness, and self-rated mood.
That said, a  2022 study  found no cognitive benefits of taking 500 mg of gotu kola extract twice daily for 2 months.
As such, more research is needed to support the benefits of gotu kola for boosting energy.

10. Maca
Maca  (Lepidium meyenii) is a plant native to Peru that’s prized for its energy-enhancing potential.
A  2024 review  found that supplements and products containing Maca root may help boost energy levels, enhance athletic performance, and reduce anxiety.
It’s important to note that Maca root powder is found in  Group D  of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) supplements guidelines. Group D refers to supplements “banned or at high risk of contamination with substances that could lead to a positive doping test.”
The AIS notes that Maca root powder itself isn’t banned, but it’s found in many products that contain banned or contaminated ingredients.

The bottom line
Some herbal supplements and essential oils may contribute to increasing energy levels and focus.
However, the best way to stay energized and focused is by leading a healthy lifestyle that includes a  nutritious diet , plenty of sleep, and stress-reducing activities like exercise.
If you constantly experience fatigue, speak with a healthcare professional. They could help determine the underlying cause and develop a treatment plan for you.
