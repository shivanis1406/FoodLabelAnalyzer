Title: The 11 Best Foods for Healthy Skin

A diet rich in healthy fats and vitamins can support skin health. Many fruits and vegetables, including red grapes and tomatoes, contain compounds that can benefit your skin.
Nutrition is important for health. An unhealthy diet can damage your metabolism, cause weight gain, and even damage organs, such as your heart and liver.
What you eat also affects another organ — your skin.
As scientists learn more about diet and the body, it’s increasingly clear that what you eat can significantly affect the health and aging of your skin.
This article takes a look at 12 of the best foods for keeping your skin healthy.

1. Fatty fish
Fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, and herring, are excellent foods for healthy skin. They’re rich sources of  omega-3 fatty acids , which are important for maintaining skin health.
Omega-3 fatty acids are necessary to help keep skin thick, supple, and moisturized. In fact, an omega-3 fatty acid deficiency can cause dry skin.
The omega-3 fats in fish reduce inflammation, which can cause redness and acne. They can even make your skin  less sensitive  to the sun’s harmful UV rays.
Some  studies  show that fish oil supplements may help fight inflammatory and autoimmune conditions affecting your skin, such as psoriasis and lupus.
Fatty  fish  is also a source of vitamin E, one of the most important antioxidants for your skin. Getting enough vitamin E is essential for helping protect your skin against damage from free radicals and inflammation.

2. Avocados
Avocados are high in healthy fats. These fats benefit many functions in your body, including the health of your skin.
A  2022 pilot study  involved healthy women consuming one avocado daily for 8 weeks. The researchers found that daily avocado consumption may may lead to enhanced elasticity and firmness of facial skin.
Avocados are also a  good source of vitamin E , which is an important antioxidant that helps protect your skin from oxidative damage. Most Americans don’t get enough vitamin E through their diet.
Vitamin C is also essential for healthy skin. Your skin needs it to create collagen, which is the main structural protein that keeps your skin strong and healthy.
Vitamin C is also an antioxidant that helps protect your skin from oxidative damage caused by the sun and the environment, which can lead to signs of aging.

3. Walnuts
Walnuts  have many characteristics that make them an excellent food for healthy skin.
They’re a good source of essential fatty acids, which are fats that your body cannot make itself.
ALA, omega-3 fats,  magnesium , and the amino acid  arginine  — all of which are found in walnuts — may also  decrease inflammation  in your body, including your skin.

4. Sunflower seeds
In general,  nuts  and  seeds  are good sources of skin-boosting nutrients.
Sunflower seeds are an excellent example. They contain high levels of both monounsaturated and omega-6 fats, and may help reduce inflammation and cholesterol levels.

5. Sweet potatoes
Beta carotene  is a nutrient found in plants. It functions as provitamin A, which means it can be converted into vitamin A in your body.
Beta carotene is found in oranges and vegetables such as carrots, spinach, and sweet potatoes.
Sweet potatoes  are an excellent source — one 1/2-cup (100-gram) serving of baked sweet potato contains enough beta carotene to provide more than six times the DV of vitamin A.
Carotenoids  like beta carotene help keep your skin healthy by acting as a natural sunblock. When consumed, this antioxidant is incorporated into your skin and helps protect your skin cells from sun exposure. This may help prevent sunburn, cell death, and dry, wrinkled skin.

6. Red or yellow bell peppers
Like sweet potatoes, bell peppers are an excellent source of beta carotene, which your body converts into vitamin A.
One cup (149 grams) of chopped red bell pepper contains the equivalent of 156% of the DV for vitamin A.
They’re also one of the best sources of  vitamin C . This vitamin is necessary for creating the protein  collagen , which keeps skin firm and strong.

7. Broccoli
Broccoli  is full of many vitamins and minerals important for skin health, including zinc, vitamin A, and vitamin C.
It also contains  lutein , a carotenoid that works like beta carotene. Lutein helps protect your skin from oxidative damage, which can cause your skin to become dry and wrinkled.
Broccoli florets also pack a special compound called  sulforaphane , which boasts some impressive potential benefits. It may even have anti-cancer effects.
Sulforaphane  is likewise a powerful protective agent against sun damage. It works in two ways: neutralizing harmful free radicals and switching on other protective systems in your body.

8. Tomatoes
Tomatoes are a great source of vitamin C and contain all of the major carotenoids, including  lycopene .
Beta carotene,  lutein , and lycopene have been shown to protect your skin against damage from the sun. They may also help prevent wrinkling.
Because tomatoes are rich in carotenoids, they’re an excellent food for maintaining healthy skin.
Consider pairing carotenoid-rich foods like tomatoes with a source of fat, such as cheese or  olive oil . Fat increases your absorption of carotenoids.

9. Dark chocolate
If you need  another reason  to eat chocolate, here it is: the effects of cocoa on your skin are pretty phenomenal.
After 6–12 weeks of consuming a cocoa powder high in antioxidants each day, participants in one study experienced thicker, more hydrated skin.
Their skin was also less rough and scaly, less sensitive to sunburn, and had better blood flow — which brings more nutrients to your skin.
Another study found that eating 20 grams of high-antioxidant dark chocolate per day could allow your skin to withstand over twice as much UV radiation before burning, compared with eating low-antioxidant chocolate.
Several other studies have observed similar results, including improvements in the appearance of wrinkles. However, keep in mind that at least one study didn’t find significant effects.
Make sure to  choose dark chocolate  with at least 70% cocoa to maximize the benefits and keep added sugar to a minimum.

10. Green tea
Green tea may help protect your skin from damage and aging.
The powerful compounds found in green tea are called catechins and work to improve the health of your skin in several ways.
Like several other antioxidant-containing foods,  green tea  can help protect your skin against sun damage.
While green tea is a great choice for healthy skin, you may want to avoid drinking your tea with  milk , as there’s evidence that milk could reduce the effect of green tea’s antioxidants.

11. Red grapes
Red grapes are famous for containing  resveratrol , a compound that comes from the grapes’ skin.
Resveratrol is credited with a wide range of health benefits, among them is reducing the effects of aging.
Test-tube studies suggest it may also help slow the production of harmful free radicals, which damage skin cells and cause signs of aging.
This beneficial compound is also found in red wine. Unfortunately, there’s not much evidence that the amount of  resveratrol  you get from a glass of red wine is enough to affect your skin.
And since red wine is an alcoholic beverage, there are  negative effects  to drinking it in excess.
It’s not recommended to start drinking red wine just because of its potential health benefits. Instead, you should increase your intake of red grapes and berries.

The takeaway
What you eat can significantly affect your skin health.
Make sure you’re getting enough essential nutrients to protect your skin. The foods on this list are great options to keep your skin healthy, strong, and attractive.
