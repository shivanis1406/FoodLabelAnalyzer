Title: When’s the Best Time to Take Probiotics?

Probiotics contain live microorganisms that can enhance your gut health. The timing of your probiotic is less important than consistency.
Even if you’ve never taken probiotics, you’ve probably heard of them.
These supplements provide numerous benefits because they contain live microorganisms, such as bacteria or yeast, which support the healthy bacteria in your gut ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
Yet, you may wonder whether you should take them at a particular time.
This article tells you whether there’s a best time to take probiotics.

Does timing matter?
Some probiotic manufacturers recommend taking the supplement on an empty stomach, while others advise taking it with food.
Though it’s difficult to measure bacteria viability in humans, some research suggests that  Saccharomyces boulardii  microorganisms survive in equal numbers with or without a meal ( 6 ).
On the other hand,  Lactobacillus  and  Bifidobacterium  survive best when taken up to 30 minutes before a meal ( 6 ).
However, consistency is probably more important than whether you take your probiotic with or without food.
A monthlong study found that probiotics caused positive changes in the  gut microbiome  regardless of whether they were taken with a meal ( 7 ).
The microorganisms used in probiotics are tested to ensure that they can survive various conditions in your stomach and intestines ( 1 ).
Nevertheless, taking probiotics with specific foods may optimize their effects.
In one study, survival rates of the microorganisms in probiotics improved when the supplement was taken alongside oatmeal or low-fat milk, compared with when it was taken with only water or apple juice ( 6 ).
This research suggests that a small amount of fat may improve bacterial survival in your digestive tract ( 6 ).
Lactobacillus  probiotics might also survive better alongside sugar or carbs, as they rely upon glucose when in an acidic environment ( 8 ).
Though research indicates that more bacteria survive if you take probiotics before a meal, consistency is probably more important than specific timing when it comes to reaping the greatest benefits for your gut.

What are probiotics used for?
Probiotics can keep your gut healthy by preventing the growth of harmful organisms, reinforcing the gut barrier, and restoring bacteria after disturbances from illness or medications like antibiotics ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
While they may also support a healthy immune system and oral, skin, and mental health, research on these benefits is currently limited ( 1 ).
Some of the live microorganisms in probiotic supplements also occur in foods that are naturally cultured or  fermented , including yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi. These foods are linked to lower blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol, and weight ( 5 ).
If you don’t regularly eat fermented foods, you may want to consider taking a  probiotic supplement  ( 5 ). You can shop for probiotic supplements at  Care/of .
Probiotics are live microorganisms that boost your gut health. Fermented foods contain some strains of these microorganisms, but if you don’t eat foods like yogurt, kefir, or fermented vegetables, probiotic supplements may be beneficial.

Different types
You can take probiotics in various forms, including capsules, lozenges, beads, powders, and drops. You can also find probiotics in  several foods and drinks , including some yogurts, fermented milks, chocolates, and flavored beverages ( 1 ).
Most probiotic microbes must endure digestive acids and enzymes before colonizing your large intestine ( 1 ,  3 ,  4 ,  9 ).
Probiotics in capsules, tablets, beads, and  yogurt  tend to survive your stomach acids better than powders, liquids, or other foods or beverages, regardless of when they’re taken ( 10 ).
Furthermore,  Lactobacillus ,  Bifidobacterium , and  Enterococci  are more resistant to stomach acid than other types of bacteria ( 10 ).
In fact, most strains of  Lactobacillus  come from the human intestinal tract, so they’re inherently resistant to stomach acid ( 8 ).
Research shows that 100 million to 1 billion probiotic microorganisms must reach your intestine for you to experience health benefits ( 10 ).
Given that probiotic cells can die throughout their shelf life, make sure you purchase a reputable product that guarantees at least 1 billion live cultures — often listed as colony-forming units (CFUs) — on its label ( 9 ).
To maintain quality, you should use your probiotic before the expiration date and store it according to the instructions on the label. Some can be kept at room temperature while others must be refrigerated.
If you have a particular health condition, you may want to consider a specific strain of probiotic or consult a medical professional to find one that’s best for you.
Experts agree that  Lactobacillus  and  Bifidobacterium  strains benefit most people ( 3 ).
In particular,  Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG  and  Saccharomyces boulardii  may reduce your risk of antibiotic-related diarrhea, while  E. coli  Nissle 1917 may help treat  ulcerative colitis  ( 4 ,  9 ,  11 ).
Meanwhile, probiotics that contain  Lactobacillus ,  Bifidobacterium , and  Saccharomyces boulardii  seem to improve symptoms in some people with  constipation , irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and several types of diarrhea ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
For a probiotic to work, its live microorganisms must reach your large intestine and colonize it. Look for a supplement that guarantees at least 1 billion live cultures on the label and ask your healthcare provider whether a particular strain is best for you.

Side effects and interactions
Probiotics usually don’t cause major side effects in healthy individuals.
However, you may experience minor symptoms, such as gas and  bloating . These often improve with time, but taking your probiotic at night may reduce daytime symptoms.
If you take a probiotic to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea, you may wonder whether the antibiotic will kill the bacteria in your probiotic. However, strains designed to help prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea won’t be affected ( 4 ,  6 ).
Keep in mind that it’s safe to take probiotics and antibiotics at the same time ( 1 ).
If you take other medications or supplements, it’s best to discuss potential interactions with your healthcare provider. That’s because probiotics may increase their effectiveness ( 12 ).
Probiotics may cause minor side effects, such as gas and bloating. Talk to a medical professional if you take other medications, as probiotics may amplify their effects.

The bottom line
Probiotics contain live microorganisms that can enhance your  gut health .
While research indicates that some strains may survive better if taken before a meal, the timing of your probiotic is less important than consistency.
Thus, you should take probiotics at the same time each day.
