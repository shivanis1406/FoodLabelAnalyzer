Elderberry is a medicinal plant that has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of conditions.
Today, it’s often sold as a supplement and said to treat respiratory infections, including the common cold and flu. Indeed, studies suggest that it may reduce the duration of colds and alleviate symptoms like fever, pain, and congestion ( 1 ,  2 ).
Elderberry supplements are available in several forms. Gummies are a particularly popular option, especially for those who have difficulty swallowing pills or prefer the taste of gummies over that of other supplements. It’s worth mentioning that they taste better than other forms because they tend to have added sugars or sweeteners — some more using more natural ingredients than others.
Also keep in mind that little to no research exists on elderberry gummies themselves. Furthermore, supplements cannot and should not replace a healthy, balanced diet.

How much elderberry should I take?
Most over-the-counter supplements provide 650–1,500 milligrams (mg) of elderberry extract per serving ( 3 ).
While there are no official guidelines on how much elderberry you should take, some studies show that doses ranging from 600–900 mg per day could be beneficial ( 2 ).
Many elderberry products also contain other ingredients that have been shown to support immune function, such as vitamin C, zinc, or echinacea ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
However, more research is needed to determine how these ingredients may affect immune health when combined with elderberry.

What are the side effects of elderberry gummies?
Certain parts of the elderberry plant — including the raw bark, leaves, and roots — contain a compound called sambunigrin, which can be toxic if consumed ( 8 ).
However, elderberry supplements are generally considered safe and rarely associated with adverse side effects ( 1 ,  9 ).
Keep in mind that some elderberry gummies contain a blend of ingredients like vitamins, minerals, or herbal extracts, some of which could cause side effects or interact with certain medications.
Additionally,  people who are pregnant  or breastfeeding should talk with a doctor before taking elderberry, as there’s limited research on its safety for these groups ( 8 ,  9 ).
