The ketogenic, or keto, diet is a very low carb, high fat diet that’s associated with several health benefits, including weight loss ( 1 ).
If you’re following this diet, protein bars can be a convenient grab-and-go option when you need a quick meal or a filling snack.
However, finding a keto-friendly bar can be difficult — most protein bars are too high in carbs or too low in fat or contain ingredients that don’t fit on a keto diet, such as dairy.
Even protein bars that meet the keto criteria are not always healthy options. They often contain large amounts of artificial ingredients, additives, and preservatives.
Still, if you look carefully, you can find protein bars that are both keto-friendly and nutritious. Alternatively, you can make them on your own.
Keep reading for our picks of the 9 best keto-friendly protein bars.
Keto-friendly bars like the ones on this list regularly contain fiber and  sugar alcohols , which your body can’t fully digest or absorb. Therefore, subtracting the grams of fiber and sugar alcohols from the total carbs gives you the number of net (digestible) carbs.
You’ll often see the number of  net carbs  highlighted on the packaging — though this value is likely lower than the number of total carbs listed in the nutritional information.

How we chose the best keto protein bars
When choosing the best keto protein bars, we considered the following factors:
Ingredient quality:  Ideally, the bar should be made mainly with whole foods and without added sugar, artificial colors or flavors, or unnecessary fillers.
Taste:  A keto protein bar should be flavorful and should not taste like a block of cardboard. We looked for bars that offer intriguing flavors and have positive reviews for taste.
Nutrition:  The bars on this list provide 5 or fewer grams (g) of net carbs per serving. They also contain a minimum of 6 g of protein and at least 7 g of fat.
Price:  These bars are typically sold in multipacks, and most cost $25–$50 per multipack.
Customer reviews:  We’ve read through reviews to find out how customers feel about the flavor, texture, and quality of these bars. We’ve also tried several of them ourselves.
Vetting:  The protein bars on our list have been vetted to ensure that they align with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being. You can read more about  our vetting process .
General price ranges with dollar signs ($–$$) are indicated below. One dollar sign means the product is rather affordable, while two dollar signs indicate a higher price.

Available flavors:  Almond Mocha Crunch, Coconut Rage, Ginger Coconut, Macarooned, Chocolate Mint, Salty Caramel, Pure Joy, Banana Nut, Double Fudge Brownie, Chunky Choco Pecan, Dark & Salty, and Cinnabähn.
MariGold Protein Bars are made with just a few ingredients, including whey isolate from grass-fed cow’s milk, cashews, filtered water, chicory root fiber, L-glutamine, grass-fed ghee, organic flavors, coconut oil, stevia extract, salt, and sunflower lecithin.
Whey protein  is a popular supplement because your body can quickly absorb this type of protein. As a result, it may promote significant increases in strength, muscle mass, and even fat loss ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
MariGold bars are also free of sugar alcohols, which are natural or manufactured carbs that taste sweet yet contain half as many calories as sugar. Some people may wish to avoid sugar alcohols because they may cause digestive distress ( 5 ).
Instead, these bars are sweetened with stevia, although a few of the flavors also contain very small amounts of coconut nectar, coconut sugar, and maple syrup.

EPIC bars are meat-based bars that contain just a handful of ingredients.
For instance, the Venison Sea Salt + Pepper bar is made using grass-fed venison, sea salt, encapsulated lactic acid (not from milk), water, black pepper, cultured celery powder, onion powder, and garlic powder.
While these bars are low in net carbs, they’re very high in sodium, providing 600–750 milligrams (mg) of sodium per bar, depending on the flavor. Most other bars on this list contain only 100–200 mg of sodium.
Keep in mind that, at time of publish, EPIC offers nine flavors, but only the six listed above are keto-friendly.

Founded in 2012, Keto Bars was one of the first companies to create protein bars specifically for the keto diet.
In addition to being high in fat and low in net carbs, these bars are vegan, dairy-free, gluten-free, and soy-free.
All three flavors have short ingredient lists and are made with a base of unsweetened chocolate, coconut, and nut butter.
To keep the bars sugar-free, the brand uses two  alternative sweeteners  — stevia and erythritol — in place of added sugar.
The Mint Chocolate bar contains chocolate, almonds, coconut, non-GMO erythritol, cocoa processed with alkali, water, salt, stevia, and peppermint oil.

BHU’s keto-friendly protein bars have a fudgy texture and are made without any artificial sweeteners or preservatives. As a result, they need to be kept refrigerated.
One unique ingredient in these bars is organic tapioca flour, which contains  prebiotic fiber . This indigestible fiber helps feed beneficial bacteria in your gut, supporting proper digestion, immune system health, and heart health ( 10 ,  11 ).
The White Chocolate Macadamia Cookie Dough bar contains the following ingredients: cashews, white chocolate, red palm oil, tapioca fiber, pea protein, macadamia nuts, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, baobab, vanilla, sunflower lecithin, sea salt, monk fruit, and water.

“BHU’s keto bars are some of the best-tasting I’ve tried. They really taste like cookie dough, and they make for a great dessert. But since they’re pretty high in fat, these relatively small bars are pretty high in calories — something to keep in mind if you’re trying to lose weight.”

Dang Bars are a great option if you’re following a  plant-based keto diet  or simply prefer a vegan-friendly snack bar.
Many of the ingredients in Dang Bars — such as nuts, pea protein, and chia and sunflower seeds — are instantly recognizable as nutritious and keto-friendly.
For example, the Lemon Matcha flavor contains the following ingredients: almonds, chicory root fiber, cocoa butter, pea protein, sunflower seeds, coconut, chia seeds, natural flavors, lemon oil, sunflower lecithin, matcha green tea, citric acid, sea salt, stevia extract, and mixed tocopherols.
Plus, these bars contain  chicory root fiber , which is an excellent source of gut-healthy prebiotic fiber. However, it’s also high in short-chain carbohydrates called FODMAPs, so these bars may not be the best option for individuals with digestive conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) ( 13 ,  14 ).

Consuming enough fiber each day is associated with a number of health benefits ( 10 ,  11 ).
No Cow Dipped Protein Bars are vegan and keto-friendly bars made using all plant-based ingredients. They’re also certified gluten-free and kosher, soy-free, and Non-GMO Project verified.
The Chocolate Sea Salt bar is made using a brown rice and pea protein blend, soluble corn fiber, chocolate coating, glycerine, almonds, palm oil, natural flavors, cocoa powder, salt, water, and a sweetener blend of monk fruit, stevia extract, and erythritol.

These bars also come in unique flavors such as Butter & Salt, as well as more traditional flavors such as Peanut Butter Chocolate Chunk.
All the varieties are gluten-free and sweetened with stevia and erythritol to keep the sugar content low. With the exception of the Butter & Salt flavor (which contains  collagen ), they’re also plant-based.

They’re available in dessert-like flavors and are highly rated for taste. They’re also gluten-free and sweetened with erythritol and stevia.
However, it’s important to note that these bars are made with milk protein, so they’re not vegan-friendly.

Homemade low carb protein bars
Homemade keto bars are ideal if you want to carefully control the ingredients used or simply enjoy the craft of concocting your own foods.
This recipe  makes bars with 319 calories and 7 g of protein each. Furthermore, each bar provides a whopping 28 g of fat and only 4 g of net carbs.
In addition to a handful of other whole ingredients, these bars are rich in  almonds , pecans, and almond butter. Research has shown that regular nut intake may aid weight loss and benefit heart health ( 23 ,  24 ).

Homemade no-bake peanut butter bars
Anyone who loves peanut butter cups will enjoy these  no-bake peanut butter protein bars  that take less than 10 minutes to make.
You’ll need just five low carb ingredients:  coconut flour , a protein powder of your choice, peanut butter, a sticky sweetener of your choice, and chocolate chips.
To keep these bars keto-friendly, the recipe recommends using monk fruit syrup because it’s carb-free. You may want to double-check that both your protein powder and your chocolate chips are keto-friendly as well.

How do these keto protein bars compare?

How to choose a healthy keto protein bar
There’s no shortage of options to choose from if you’re looking for a keto-friendly protein bar.
When you’re deciding which product is right for you, it’s important to consider the macronutrient profile of the bar and its ingredient list.
There are several versions of the  keto diet , though the most popular one encourages getting at least 70% of your daily calories from fat, 20% from protein, and no more than 10% from carbs ( 1 ,  25 ).
If you’re following a standard keto diet, you’ll want to stick to this macronutrient breakdown as closely as possible. For a 200-calorie bar, this ratio would equal 16 g of fat, 10 g of protein, and no more than 5 g of net carbs.
Try to avoid bars with a long list of ingredients you don’t recognize, such as  artificial sweeteners  or preservatives, as these indicate that the bar is more heavily processed.
Research suggests that diets high in ultra-processed foods are linked to an increased risk of chronic health conditions such as cancer, heart disease, and obesity ( 26 ,  27 ,  28 ).
Instead, choose bars made mostly from  whole foods  such as oils, spices, natural sweeteners, nuts, and seeds. Because the keto diet is high in fat, you should also look for healthy fats such as nuts and nut butter, MCT oil, avocado oil, and flax, chia, or hemp seeds.
In addition to the macronutrient breakdown and ingredients, you may want to consider:
price
available flavors
texture

Benefits of a keto diet
A keto diet, which is based on very low carb and high fat foods, has been shown to offer a number of potential  benefits  when combined with sound nutrition principles.
Originally created for the management of childhood epileptic seizures, the keto diet has become popular with the general public for a number of health reasons ( 29 ).
One of these is that it may help promote weight loss, at least while a person is following the diet ( 30 ).
Some research has also found that a keto diet can be beneficial for improving blood sugar regulation ( 31 ,  32 ,  33 ).
Furthermore, some studies suggest that it may support brain health, possibly offering a therapeutic benefit for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease ( 34 ,  35 ).
However, more research is needed on the long-term health effects of following a keto diet.

Frequently asked questions about keto protein bars
Most  Atkins  bars will fit into a keto diet, as they generally contain a small amount of net carbs and are sweetened with sugar alcohols in place of added sugar. It’s always best to read the ingredient list to make sure any protein bar aligns with your needs and preferences.
Low carb protein bars can be a convenient and quick way to boost your protein intake if you don’t have time to make a protein-rich, keto-friendly snack. However, not all bars are created equal.
We recommend reading the nutrition facts and ingredient list on any low carb protein bar you’re considering and seeing how it compares with the options listed above.
Ideally, bars will have ingredients derived from whole foods, a short ingredient list, and no added sugar or unnecessary fillers.
Fiber One bars are not the best snack bars to eat on a keto diet. This is because they are generally lower in calories and fat and contain around 12–20 g of net carbs, which is more likely to break ketosis.
Additionally, Fiber One bars don’t contain much fat — most varieties provide only about 6 g per bar. Because a keto diet is characterized by very low carb, high fat foods, Fiber One bars do not meet most of the requirements.
Many Quest protein bars are keto-friendly, containing 3–5 g of net carbs per bar. They are also higher in protein and lower in fat than some other keto-friendly bars. However, they do contain the artificial sweetener  sucralose , which may be a downside for some.

The bottom line
Numerous low carb, high fat protein bars align with the keto diet to keep you feeling full between meals or to provide a quick and easy breakfast.
It’s important to look for bars that pack a decent amount of protein, fiber,  healthy fats , and other nutritious ingredients.
Of course, whipping up a batch of homemade bars is a great option as well.
