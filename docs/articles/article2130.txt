Title: 20 Foods That Are High in Vitamin K

You can get dietary vitamin K from vegetables, including leafy greens, and from animal sources, including some dairy products and types of meat.
Vitamin K is an important nutrient that plays a vital role in blood clotting and bone and heart health.
While vitamin K deficiency is rare, suboptimal intake may impair your health over time. Inadequate intake may impair blood clotting, weaken your bones, and increase your risk of heart disease.
For this reason, you should make sure to obtain plenty of this vitamin from your diet. Getting the Daily Value (DV) of  120 mcg  should prevent insufficiency in most people.
Here are 20 foods that provide especially high amounts of vitamin K, plus a few lists categorized by food group.

Which foods contain vitamin K?
Vitamin K is a group of compounds divided into two groups — K1 (phylloquinone) and K2 (menaquinone).
Vitamin K1, the most common form, is mainly found in plant foods. The best sources of vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) are dark,  leafy green vegetables . In fact, the prefix “phyllo” in this vitamin’s name refers to leaves.
K2, on the other hand, is only found in animal foods and fermented plant foods, such as  natto . However, exact data about the exact amounts of K2 in foods is currently limited.

How do you meet your vitamin K requirements?
The richest sources of vitamin K1 are dark, leafy green vegetables. For example, just 1/2 cup (59 grams) of cooked kale provides  205%  of the  DV .
To get the most out of this vitamin in kale and other plant foods, consider eating them with butter or oil. That’s because vitamin K is  fat-soluble  and may be better absorbed when combined with fat.
Vitamin K2 is only found in animal foods and certain fermented dishes. Small amounts are also produced by your  gut bacteria .
Natto, a Japanese dish made from fermented soybeans, is one of the best sources of vitamin K2. Other good sources include meat, liver, and cheese.
Evidence suggests  that the metabolism and functions of vitamin K1 and K2 are slightly different, though this isn’t fully understood. While dietary guidelines don’t currently distinguish between the two, it’s probably a good idea to include both types in your diet.

The bottom line
Vitamin K can be found in numerous plant and animal foods. Although  deficiencies are rare , it’s important to ensure that you’re getting enough of this essential vitamin through your diet.
Dark leafy greens are especially rich in this vitamin, with numerous types providing well over 100% of the DV in a single serving. Certain types of  liver  are good sources as well.
If you’re looking to up your vitamin K intake, look no further than the foods on this list.
Try this today:  The next time you buy  fresh beets , don’t throw out the leaves. Cook up the greens as a side dish that packs a hearty dose of vitamin K.
