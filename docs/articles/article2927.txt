Title: How Much Protein in Chicken? Breast, Thigh and More

Chicken comes in a variety of cuts, providing between 24 and 32 grams of protein per 100 grams, depending on the cut. All chicken is high in protein, breasts providing the highest protein count.
Chicken is one of the most commonly consumed meats worldwide.
It is especially popular among fitness enthusiasts because it is a great source of  protein .
High-protein foods can help you reach your health and fitness goals, such as building muscle, maintaining muscle and losing fat ( 1 ,  2 ).
This table shows how much protein is in different cuts of chicken, including breasts, thighs, wings and drumsticks.

Chicken breast: 56 grams of protein
Chicken breast is one of the most popular cuts of chicken.
A skinless, cooked chicken breast (174 grams) contains 56 grams of protein. This is equal to 32 grams of protein per 100 grams ( 3 ).
A chicken breast also has 289 calories, or 166 calories per 100 grams ( 3 ).
Chicken breast is especially popular among bodybuilders and those who want to lose weight. Its high protein and low calorie contents mean you can eat more chicken without worrying about consuming too many calories.

Chicken thigh: 27 grams of protein
Chicken thigh is another popular cut of meat that is slightly cheaper than chicken breast.
One skinless cooked chicken thigh (111 grams) contains 27 grams of protein. This is equal to 25 grams of protein per 100 grams ( 4 ).
Chicken thighs also have 195 calories per thigh, or 176 calories per 100 grams ( 4 ).
Interestingly, chicken thighs have a slightly darker color than chicken breast. This is because the chicken’s legs are more active and contain more myoglobin. This molecule helps provide active muscles with oxygen and also makes them redder ( 5 ).
Some people find that the darkness of chicken thighs gives them a more succulent taste.

Chicken drumstick: 23 grams of protein
The chicken leg has two parts — the thigh and the drumstick. The drumstick is the lower part of the chicken leg, also known as the calf.
One chicken drumstick without the skin (95 grams) contains 23 grams of protein. This is equal to 24 grams of protein per 100 grams.
Chicken drumsticks also have 142 calories per drumstick, or 149 calories per 100 grams ( 6 ).
Most people eat a drumstick with the skin on. A chicken drumstick with the skin on has 156 calories ( 6 ).

Chicken wing: 6.4 grams of protein
Chicken wings consist of three parts — the drumette, the wingette and the wing tip. They are often consumed as snacks or bar food.
One chicken wing (85 grams) has 20 grams of protein. This is equal to 24 grams of protein per 100 grams.
Chicken wings also have 216 calories per wing, or 254 calories per 100 grams ( 7 ).

Which cut should you eat for maximum benefit?
The cut of chicken you should eat depends on your health and fitness goals.
While all cuts of chicken are great sources of protein, some are leaner. The extra fat in the thigh, drumstick and wings can benefit some goals but hinder others.
If you’re trying to  lose weight , then chicken breast is the best cut for you. It is the leanest part of the chicken, which means it has the fewest calories but the most protein.
For example, chicken breast is ideal for bodybuilders on a cut, since it has the fewest calories. Watching calories is especially important for bodybuilders participating in contests, given that this is when they need to have low body fat.
However, people who are following  low-carb  or  keto diets  may benefit from eating fattier cuts of chicken, as they need more fat in their diets.
If your goal is to build muscle or  gain weight , you will need to eat more calories than your body burns daily. People who fall into this group can benefit from eating fattier cuts of chicken, since they contain more calories.
Lastly, people who want to maintain their muscle mass or improve recovery may benefit from eating the breast. It contains the most protein by weight, which is the most important factor for them when it comes to choosing which cut of chicken to eat.

The bottom line
Chicken is a popular meat and  great source of protein .
The chicken breast is lean and has the most protein by weight, making it ideal for people who want to lose weight, maintain muscle mass and improve recovery.
Fattier cuts like the thigh, drumstick and wings have more calories, which make them better for people wanting to build muscle or gain weight.
People on low-carb or keto diets also need to eat more fat and may benefit from eating these cuts too.
Overall, chicken is a great addition to your diet. The cut of chicken you choose should suit your personal health and fitness goals.
