Title: What Is Locust Bean Gum, and Is It Vegan?

Locust bean gum, also called carob gum, is a natural thickener that’s commonly added to packaged foods and has many uses in cooking and food manufacturing.
However, its name (a locust is a type of grasshopper) may cause you to wonder whether it’s vegan-friendly.
This article reviews the benefits and downsides of locust bean gum, as well as whether it’s vegan.

Origin and uses
Locust bean gum is extracted from the seeds of the  carob  tree. In many ways, this tropical tree is similar to the cacao plant, from which chocolate is made.
Locust bean gum is a fine white powder with many uses in food production. The gum is mildly sweet and has a subtle chocolate taste. However, it’s used in such small amounts that it does not affect the flavor of the products it’s added to.
In fact, other parts of the carob tree — mostly its fruit — are commonly used as substitutes for chocolate.
Locust bean gum is made of an indigestible fiber called galactomannan polysaccharides, which have a long, chain-like molecular structure. These polysaccharides give the gum its unique ability to turn into a gel in liquid and thicken foods ( 1 ).
Locust bean gum comprises mostly carbs in the form of  fiber . However, it also contains some protein, calcium, and sodium ( 2 ).
It’s most commonly used as a thickener in food production, particularly in natural or organic foods that are free of highly refined ingredients.
Despite its misleading name, locust bean gum is a  vegan  product that has nothing to do with locusts, a type of grasshopper.
The gum comes from the seeds of the carob tree, which is also known as the locust tree, as its pods resemble the insect of the same name.
Locust bean gum is appropriate for  vegan diets . In fact, it’s an excellent plant-based thickener that can help add structure and stability to vegan desserts, such as nondairy ice cream and  yogurt .
Locust bean gum comes from the carob tree and is a vegan product. It comprises mostly fiber and is primarily used as a thickening agent for food.

Potential health benefits
Locust bean gum has several potential health benefits.
However, more research in humans is needed to fully understand them.
All of the carbs in this product come from fiber in the form of galactomannan polysaccharides. These long chains of  soluble fiber  allow the gum to gel and thicken in liquid ( 1 ,  2 ).
Soluble fiber is also great for your gut health.
Because this fiber is not absorbed in your body and turns into gel in your digestive tract, it helps soften stool and can  reduce constipation  ( 3 ).
In addition, soluble fiber is thought to be heart-healthy, as it can bind to dietary cholesterol, preventing it from being absorbed into your bloodstream ( 3 ).
However, locust bean gum is used in very small quantities in most foods, so you may not reap the benefits of soluble fiber by consuming products that contain it.
Locust bean gum is also used as an additive in infant formulas for babies who experience reflux, which is characterized by frequent episodes of spitting up.
It helps thicken the formula and keep it from rising back into the esophagus after entering the stomach, which can contribute to reflux and discomfort.
It also slows gastric emptying, or how quickly foods pass from the stomach into the intestines. This can also reduce intestinal issues and reflux in babies.
Several studies have demonstrated the benefits of formula containing locust bean gum for  babies who experience reflux  ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
Some studies have found that taking locust bean gum supplements may help reduce blood sugar and blood fat levels. This may be due to the high amount of fiber they contain ( 8 ).
One study looked at the effects of locust bean gum in 17 adults and 11 children, some of whom had familial, or inherited, high cholesterol ( 9 ).
The group that ate foods containing 8–30 grams of locust bean gum per day for 2 weeks experienced greater improvements in cholesterol than a control group that ate no locust bean gum ( 9 ).
In addition, other parts of the carob plant, particularly its fruit, may improve blood fat levels by reducing LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglyceride levels ( 10 ,  11 ,  12 ).
Locust bean gum may also help  decrease blood sugar levels  by limiting the body’s absorption of carbs and sugars in food ( 13 ).
Additionally, one rat study from the 1980s found that locust bean gum stabilized blood sugar levels by slowing the transit of food through the stomach and intestines. However, the study is old, and its results have not been reproduced in humans ( 14 ).
Overall, much of the research on these benefits was conducted in animals and is outdated. Thus, more studies in humans are needed before the potential benefits of locust bean gum can be fully understood.
Locust bean gum is high in fiber and may help decrease blood sugar and blood fat levels. It is also used in infant formulas to help reduce reflux.

Precautions and side effects
Locust bean gum is a safe  food additive  with few side effects.
However, some people may be allergic to it. This allergy can take the form of asthma and breathing issues, which can be serious ( 15 ).
If you are allergic to locust bean gum, you should avoid it and all carob-containing foods.
Additionally, some premature infants have experienced health issues after receiving formula thickened with locust bean gum that was incorrectly mixed ( 1 ).
However, because this product is indigestible, it presents few risks to healthy children or adults. If you have any concerns, make sure to discuss them with your healthcare provider.
Locust bean gum is indigestible and presents few risks. Some people may be allergic to it, and some premature infants may have bad reactions to formula that contains locust bean gum if it has been mixed incorrectly.

The bottom line
Locust bean gum is a natural, plant-based, vegan food thickener used in many commercial products. It is primarily made of fiber.
It helps reduce reflux in infants when added to formula and may improve blood fat and blood sugar levels.
However, more research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits of locust bean gum.
If you want to use it as a food thickener in your kitchen, you can purchase locust bean gum  online . It works well for thickening soups, sauces, and desserts.
