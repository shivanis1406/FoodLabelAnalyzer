Title: What Are Capers — and Are They Healthy?

Capers are small, pickled flower buds that can add saltiness and tang to a dish. They’re high in sodium and best use sparingly for both flavor and health reasons.
Salty, rich, and tangy, capers are a mainstay in Mediterranean cuisine and used to bring a burst of flavor to a variety of dishes.
Capers are the immature flower buds of  Capparis spinosa , a type of bush that’s commonly cultivated in countries like Spain, Italy, and Greece ( 1 ).
They’re usually salted and pickled and used as a garnish or seasoning, thanks to their small size and intense flavor.
What’s more, capers pack quite a punch in terms of nutrition and may be associated with several health benefits.
This article explores some of the benefits and downsides of capers and will take a closer look at how to use them.

Nutritional profile of capers
Because capers are consumed in very small amounts, each serving provides a low number of calories and few grams of carbs, fat, and protein.
However, they do contain a high amount of sodium, along with a small amount of copper and  vitamin K.
A tablespoon (9 grams) of canned capers contains ( 2 ):
Calories:  2
Protein:  0.2 grams
Carbs:  0.4 grams
Fiber:  0.3 grams
Sodium:  9% of the Daily Value (DV)
Copper:  4% of the DV
Vitamin K:  2% of the DV
Riboflavin:  1% of the DV
Iron:  1% of the DV
Magnesium:  1% of the DV
Sodium plays a central role in regulating fluid balance and blood pressure levels ( 3 ).
Capers also contain  copper , an essential mineral involved in iron metabolism, energy production, and brain function ( 4 ).
Plus, they provide a bit of vitamin K, a micronutrient that your body needs for blood clotting and bone health ( 5 ).
Capers are low in calories, carbs, protein, and fat and contain a small amount of copper and vitamin K — two essential nutrients.

Potential health benefits of eating capers
Capers may be associated with several health benefits.
Capers are  rich in antioxidants , which are compounds that can neutralize harmful free radicals to prevent cell damage ( 1 ,  6 ).
Some research also indicates that antioxidants may reduce inflammation and protect against chronic conditions like heart disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes ( 6 ).
According to test-tube studies, capers are an especially good source of antioxidants like quercetin and  rutin  ( 1 ).
Both of these compounds have been well-studied for their ability to alleviate inflammation, enhance wound healing, and promote healthy blood sugar levels ( 7 ,  8 ).
Capers are loaded with flavor yet low in calories, making them an excellent addition to a healthy weight loss diet. And for some people, losing weight may benefit their overall health.
By swapping capers in for higher calorie ingredients used to flavor dishes, you may  decrease your daily intake of calories , which can lead to weight loss ( 9 ).
Although more research is needed, some studies suggest that capers may have potent diabetes-fighting properties.
According to one review, certain components found in capers could help  promote better blood sugar management  by enhancing the uptake of sugar by the tissues, reducing carbohydrate absorption, and protecting the cells that produce insulin in the pancreas ( 10 ).
A small study including 30 people with diabetes showed that consuming a tonic-containing caper extract 3 times per day helped prevent increases in blood sugar and  triglyceride levels  ( 11 ).
Similarly, an older study in 54 people with diabetes found that consuming 400 mg of caper fruit extract 3 times daily for 2 months led to significant improvements in fasting blood sugar levels and long-term blood sugar management compared with those in a control group ( 12 ).
Still, more studies are needed to determine how capers may affect blood sugar levels when enjoyed in normal amounts as part of a healthy diet.
Capers are rich in antioxidants, including quercetin and rutin. They may also help support weight loss and promote healthy blood sugar levels, but more research is needed.

Potential downsides of eating capers
Capers are relatively high in sodium, packing nearly 9% of the recommended daily value into a 1-tablespoon (9-gram) serving ( 2 ).
Although  sodium is important  for many aspects of health, consuming high amounts can increase blood pressure levels, especially among people who are more sensitive to its effects ( 13 ).
High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke ( 14 ,  15 ).
Furthermore,  high sodium diets  have been linked to other adverse effects on health, including an increased risk of stomach cancer ( 16 ,  17 ,  18 ).
For this reason, it’s best to enjoy capers in moderation as part of a well-rounded diet, especially if you’re watching your intake of salt or following a  low sodium diet .
Additionally, you can rinse capers before using them to help decrease their sodium content.
Capers are relatively high in sodium, which may increase your blood pressure levels. High sodium diets have also been linked to other adverse effects, including an increased risk of stomach cancer.

How to use capers
Capers are a versatile ingredient that can be easily added to a variety of recipes.
Typically available pickled and canned, they have a rich, salty flavor and slightly tangy taste that works well in sandwiches, salads, and pasta dishes.
They’re also commonly used to make chicken piccata or served on bagels paired with lox,  cream cheese , onions, tomatoes, and cucumbers.
If you’re feeling creative, you can also try using capers as a topping for your next homemade pizza, mixing them into dips and dressings, or swapping them in for pickles when making  tuna  or macaroni salad.
Keep in mind that capers are very salty, so you may need to adjust your recipes accordingly or rinse excess salt off of your capers before adding them to your recipes.
Capers can add a rich, salty flavor and tangy taste to sandwiches, salads, and pasta dishes. They can also be used to make chicken piccata, lox bagels, pizzas, dips, and dressings.

The bottom line
Capers are widely used as a seasoning and garnish in  Mediterranean cuisine .
Although they’re low in calories and contain several important vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, they’re also very high in sodium and should be enjoyed in moderation.
Try adding capers to pizza, pasta dishes, salads, sauces, and dressings for an extra burst of flavor and nutrients.
