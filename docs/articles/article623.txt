Title: 9 Impressive Health Benefits of Onions

Onions are highly nutritious vegetables that may have several benefits, including improved heart health, better blood sugar regulation, and increased bone density.
Onions  are members of the  Allium  genus of flowering plants, which also includes garlic, shallots, and leeks.
They’re delicious, versatile, and relatively cheap, and they boast a wide range of healthy vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds.
The medicinal properties of onions have been recognized for  thousands of years . Athletes in ancient Greece supposedly used onions to purify their blood, while medieval and traditional doctors prescribed them to help treat  headaches ,  heart disease , and  mouth sores .
Read on to discover 9 health benefits of onions.

1. Packed with nutrients
Onions are  nutrient-dense , meaning they’re low in calories but high in vitamins,  fiber , and minerals.
One  medium onion  (110 grams [g]) contains:
Calories:  44
Protein:  1.2 g
Carbs:  10.3 g
Sugar:  4.7 g
Fiber:  1.9 g
Fat:  0.1 g
Potassium:  3.4% of Daily Value (DV)
Vitamin C:  9% of the DV
Onions are high in  vitamin C , which may help regulate your immune health, collagen production, and  iron absorption .
It’s also a powerful antioxidant that could help  protect your cells  from unstable, damaging molecules called free radicals.
Onions are rich in B vitamins, including  folate  and  vitamin B6 . These play  key roles  in metabolism, red blood cell production, and nerve function.
Lastly, onions are a good source of  potassium , a mineral that may  help with :
cellular function
fluid balance
nerve transmission
kidney function
muscle contraction
The average potassium intake of Americans is  less than half  the recommended DV of 4,700 milligrams (mg). So, adding onions to your diet is a great way to increase your potassium intake.

2. May benefit heart health
Onions contain antioxidants and compounds that may  reduce your risk  of heart disease by fighting inflammation and lowering  triglyceride  and  cholesterol  levels.
They contain a large amount of  quercetin , a flavonoid antioxidant and anti-inflammatory that may help  lower high blood pressure .
A small  2015 study  in 70 people with overweight and  hypertension  suggests that a daily dose of 162 mg of quercetin-rich onion extract may significantly reduce systolic blood pressure by 3.6 millimeters of mercury.
Also, a small  2014 study  in 54 females with  polycystic ovary syndrome  found that consuming 80–120 g of raw red onions per day for 8 weeks lowered total and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels.
However, more research is needed.

3. Loaded with antioxidants
Antioxidants  are compounds that inhibit oxidation, a process that may lead to cellular damage and  contribute  to diseases such as cancer,  diabetes , and heart disease.
Onions are an excellent source of antioxidants and contain at least  17 types  of flavonoids.
Red onions, in particular, contain  anthocyanins , plant pigments in the flavonoid family that give red onions their deep color. These may protect against  diabetes  and certain types of  cancer .
In a  2016 study  involving 43,880 males, researchers found that habitual anthocyanin intakes up to 613 mg were correlated with a 14% lower risk of nonfatal heart attacks.
Similarly, the authors of a  2019 review  concluded that consuming more anthocyanin-rich foods was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and of death from heart disease.

4. Contain anticancer compounds
Allium  vegetables such as onions and garlic may lower your risk of developing certain types of cancer, including  stomach  and  colorectal  cancers.
In a  2015 review  of 26 studies, researchers concluded that people who consumed the most allium vegetables were 22% less likely to receive a diagnosis of stomach cancer than those who consumed the least.
And in a  2014 review  of 16 studies involving a total of 13,333 people, researchers suggested that people with the greatest onion intake had a 15% lower risk of colorectal cancer than those with the lowest intake.
Test-tube studies suggest that onionin A, a sulfur-containing compound in onions, may help  decrease tumor development  and  slow the spread  of ovarian cancer.
Onions also contain  fisetin  and  quercetin , which are flavonoid antioxidants that may inhibit tumor growth.

5. Help regulate blood sugar
Eating onions may help regulate  blood sugar  levels, which is significant for people with diabetes or  prediabetes .
A small  2010 study  in 84 people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes found that eating 100 g of raw red onion significantly reduced fasting blood sugar levels after 4 hours.
A  2020 study  showed that rats with diabetes who ate food containing 5% dried onion powder for 8 weeks had decreased fasting blood sugar levels and lower triglyceride and cholesterol levels than a control group.
Quercetin has also been shown to help  regulate  whole-body blood sugar balance by interacting with cells in the:
small intestine
pancreas
skeletal muscle
fat tissue
liver

6. May boost bone density
Dairy gets much of the credit for boosting bone health, but other foods, including onions, may also help support  strong bones .
A small  2016 study  in 24 middle-aged and  postmenopausal  females found that those who consumed 100 milliliters of onion juice daily for 8 weeks had improved bone mineral density and antioxidant activity compared to a control group.
Also, a  2009 study  in 507 perimenopausal and postmenopausal females found that those who ate onions at least once per day had a 5% greater overall bone density than those who ate onions once per month or less often.
Onions may help reduce  oxidative stress , boost antioxidant levels, and decrease bone loss. This may help  prevent   osteoporosis  and improve bone density.

7. Have antibacterial properties
Onions may help  fight potentially dangerous bacteria  such as:
Escherichia coli  ( E. coli )
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Staphylococcus aureus  ( S. aureus )
Bacillus cereus
A  2010 test-tube study  suggests that onion extract might inhibit the growth of  Vibrio cholerae , a type of bacteria that is a major public health concern in some parts of the world.
Quercetin extracted from onions may also reduce bacteria growth.
One  review  suggests that it could inhibit the growth of several strains of bacteria, including  Helicobacter pylori , a type of bacteria associated with stomach ulcers and certain digestive cancers.
Another  test-tube study  found that quercetin damaged the cell walls and membranes of  E. coli  and  S. aureus .

8. May boost digestive health
Onions are a rich source of fiber and prebiotics, which are necessary for optimal gut health.
Prebiotics  are nondigestible types of fiber that are broken down by  beneficial gut bacteria .
Gut bacteria feed on prebiotics and create  short-chain fatty acids , which  may help :
strengthen gut health
boost immunity
reduce inflammation
enhance digestion
Consuming  prebiotic foods  may also help increase probiotics, such as  Lactobacillus  and  Bifidobacterium  strains, which  benefit digestive health .
Onions are rich in the prebiotics inulin and  fructooligosaccharides , which may help increase the number of friendly bacteria in your gut and improve immune function.

9. Easy to add to your diet
Onions are a fresh and versatile staple in kitchens around the world. They can be cooked, fried, eaten raw, and more.
To incorporate onions into your diet, you can try:
using them in soups such as French onion soup
using them in  dips and spreads  such as guacamole, salsa, and ranch
adding them to egg dishes such as omelets, frittatas, and quiches
making cooked toppings, such as caramelized onions, to top meat or tofu or add to savory baked goods
using them raw as a topping for tacos, fajitas, and other Mexican dishes and savory baked goods
adding them to salads, such as a  chickpea , chopped onion, and red pepper salad
using them in stir-fries, pasta sauces, or curries

Takeaway
Onions are nutrient-packed vegetables that contain powerful compounds that may help decrease your risk of heart disease and certain cancers.
They have antibacterial properties and promote digestive health, which may improve immune function.
What’s more, they’re versatile and can be used to heighten the flavor of any dish.
