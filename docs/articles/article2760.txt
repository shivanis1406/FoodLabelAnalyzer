Title: 15 Soft Foods to Eat After Having Your Wisdom Teeth Removed

It’s normal to be sore after having your wisdom teeth removed. Eating soft foods such as soups, yogurt, and ice cream may help make recovery easier and prevent infections or complications.
Wisdom teeth , also known as third molars, grow in each corner at the back of your mouth. Every year, there are close to  5 million  wisdom tooth extractions in the United States.
The  recovery  may take anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks. During this time, it’s important to eat soft foods that are high in vitamins, minerals, and energy.
Doing this can help:
avoid dislodging natural blood clots
prevent food chunks or debris from getting stuck in the extraction sites
prevent infections or complications, such as  dry sockets
reduce swelling
provide nourishment
speed up healing
Read on to discover 15 soft foods to eat after having your wisdom teeth removed, as well as some to avoid.

15 foods to eat
Blended soups, such as  tomato  soup and pumpkin soup, are great to eat during the first 5 days after having your wisdom teeth removed. They’re easy to consume, don’t require chewing, and don’t contain bits that could irritate the surgical sites.
Blended soups may also be packed with nutrient-dense  vegetables  and  legumes , which are rich in  micronutrients . Plus, soup can help you stay hydrated, which is very important after surgery.
It’s wise to make sure your soups are either lukewarm or cold, because hot soups might cause irritation. Also, make sure to blend vegetable-based soups until they’re as smooth as possible to avoid chunks.
Like soups,  broths  may be an excellent source of nourishment and hydration for the first few days after surgery.
Bone broth  is made by simmering bones and connective tissues, which may come from:
turkeys
chickens
lambs
pigs
cows
fish
It’s packed with  vitamins and minerals  and touted for its numerous  health benefits .
Bone broth is also high in  amino acids , which may contribute to its  anti-inflammatory  benefits.
As with soup, remember to consume the broth either lukewarm or cold to avoid irritating the wound.
Greek yogurt  is a nutritious, smooth, and creamy food that may help soothe and numb your mouth after dental surgery. It’s  rich  in protein, vitamins, and minerals such as calcium and zinc.
An older  research review  suggests that  high protein foods  may be crucial in speeding up the recovery process.
Adequate zinc intake may also  promote  wound healing. However, if you already get enough zinc, consuming more may not provide any added benefits.
Potatoes  are a root vegetable that can be prepared in many ways. When mashed, they may be comforting after you’ve had your wisdom teeth removed.
They’re rich in  calories  and nutrients, which is important for recovery. People have slightly higher energy requirements after having surgery.
Before eating mashed potatoes, make sure they’re completely smooth and have no chunks in them. Adding butter, milk, or water might help loosen the mash.
It’s important to eat them lukewarm to prevent irritating your wound.
Scrambled  eggs  are a fantastic semisoft food to start eating once you’re ready to slowly chew with your other teeth.
They’re a high quality  source  of protein, vitamins, and minerals, including:
vitamins A and B12
zinc
iron
selenium
These are all important for maintaining a  healthy  immune system and healing wounds.
Apples  are hard and crunchy, which isn’t ideal after having your wisdom teeth removed.
Eating  applesauce  is one way to increase your fruit intake within 24 hours of surgery. It’s rich in vitamins B, C, and E and copper.
Applesauce is usually made from pureed apples, which are typically skinless and cored. This reduces their nutritional content since the skin contains many vitamins and minerals as well as  fiber .
Nevertheless, a skinless apple is a good source of vitamin C, which may help:
reduce inflammation and pain
boost  your immune system
improve  fibroblast migration  and in vitro wound closure
The soft texture of a  banana  makes it easy to chew, savor, and swallow once you’re ready to gradually start chewing after dental surgery.
Bananas are incredibly  nutritious , providing a wide variety of vitamins and minerals, such as:
potassium
vitamin B6
manganese
folate
Mashing bananas could further soften their texture to reduce the risk of discomfort.
The coldness of ice cream may have a soothing effect on the extraction wound. However,  regular ice cream  is typically high in  sugar  and fat.
Banana ice cream is a healthy and delicious homemade alternative.
Ingredients
3–4 bananas, peeled
a splash of your preferred milk, such as dairy, almond, or oat
Instructions
Place the bananas in the freezer for 3–4 hours or overnight.
Slice the frozen bananas.
Place the slices in a blender and add milk.
Blend until the mixture has a thick, smooth consistency.
Enjoy.
Avocados  are a unique fruit. While most fruits are high in carbs, avocados are low in carbs but high in  healthy fats .
They’re a  rich source  of vitamins K and C and potassium, and they boast many other  health benefits . Their smooth, creamy texture makes them great for eating when you’re recovering from dental surgery.
It may be best to consume guacamole or whipped or mashed avocados during your recovery.
Smoothies  are a great way to boost your nutrient intake when you can’t eat a solid meal.
They’re easy to consume, customizable to your tastes and nutrition goals, and highly versatile.
For example, smoothies with Greek yogurt or a scoop of  protein powder  may significantly boost your protein intake, while fruit-loaded smoothies may increase your fiber intake.
For a healthy, balanced smoothie, add fruits, vegetables, and a protein source to the blender.
It’s best to avoid seeded fruits such as strawberries and blackberries during your recovery. Seeds could get stuck in the extraction site, which may lead to infections or complications.
Hummus  is a common Middle Eastern dip and spread in that has become popular worldwide.
It’s a great  source  of healthy fats, vitamins, minerals, and protein. This makes hummus an excellent food for someone who has just had their wisdom teeth removed.
You can easily make hummus at home by blending the following ingredients in a food processor:
chickpeas
tahini
olive oil
garlic
lemon
Alternatively, you can buy premade hummus from most supermarkets.
During your recovery, you won’t be able to enjoy the hummus with chips or pita bread because their crunchy texture may damage the wound. But hummus is still delicious to eat by itself.
Cottage cheese  is low in calories but  packed  with protein, vitamins, and minerals. It’s also soft and creamy, which may make it easier to eat as you gradually start to chew again.
Try adding it to scrambled eggs or smoothies or just eating it on its own.
Oats  are among the most  nutritious  foods. They’re filling, they’re a good source of fiber, and they contain vitamins and minerals.
Since they have a slightly chewy and sticky texture, it’s best to wait to consume them until at least 3 days after having your wisdom teeth removed.  Instant oats  may be a better option than other types of oats, such as steel cut, since they’re less chewy.
To avoid irritation, make sure the oats have cooled before eating them.
Mashed, cooked  pumpkin  is great to eat after you’ve had your wisdom teeth removed. Its soft, mushy texture makes it easy to chew and swallow without causing irritation.
While sometimes referred to as a vegetable, pumpkin is actually a fruit. It’s  rich  in vitamins A, C, and E and minerals such as potassium.
As with mashed potatoes or bananas, make sure your pumpkin is fully mashed and cooled before eating it.
Salmon is one of the  healthiest fish  you can eat. It’s also great to eat once you’re ready to start chewing during your recovery from surgery.
Salmon is a  rich source  of protein and healthy fats such as  omega-3 fatty acids . These fats may aid wound healing by reducing inflammation, especially if you have low omega-3 levels.

Foods to avoid
Several types of foods may irritate the extraction wounds in your mouth or dislodge the blood clots, which are crucial for healing after surgery.
During your recovery, avoid consuming:
Spicy foods , which may cause pain and irritation.
Crunchy and crumbly foods (such as chips or cookies) , which may get lodged in the wound area and potentially cause infections or complications.
Most grains, seeds, and nuts , which may get lodged in the wound and disrupt healing.
Chewy foods  for a few days, as they might increase your risk of biting your cheek, lips, and tongue, especially while your mouth is still numb.
Alcohol , as it may irritate the wound or interact with any prescribed medication. It’s best to avoid alcohol entirely during the recovery period.
It’s also important to avoid using a straw while you recover from wisdom tooth removal. Straws create suction in your mouth, which may increase your risk of developing a dry socket.

Takeaway
If you’ve just had your wisdom teeth removed, it’s important to choose nutrient-rich and soft-textured foods. These may support recovery and help prevent discomfort, and they will keep you full.
If you’re having your wisdom teeth removed soon, it may be worthwhile to stock your kitchen with these delicious foods to make sure you’ll stay nourished and satisfied after surgery.
