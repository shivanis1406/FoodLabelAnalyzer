Title: Is Cornstarch Gluten-Free?

Cornstarch is a thickening agent most often used to make marinades, sauces, dressings, soups, gravies, and some desserts. It’s derived entirely from corn.
If you follow a gluten-free diet for personal or health reasons, you may wonder whether this product contains any gluten.
This article tells you whether cornstarch is gluten-free.

Most cornstarch is gluten-free
Cornstarch is a fine, white powder processed from the endosperm of  corn . The endosperm is the nutrient-rich tissue inside the grain.
Corn is a  gluten-free grain , and no other ingredients are typically required to make cornstarch. As a result, pure cornstarch — which contains 100% cornstarch — is naturally gluten-free.
However, cornstarch may be made in a facility that also manufactures gluten-containing foods.
If so, it may be cross-contaminated with traces of gluten. In this case, a disclaimer on the label should note the factory status.
The best way to ensure that your cornstarch is gluten-free is to  check the label  for appropriate certification.
To be certified, a food must be tested and confirmed to contain fewer than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten. This is a very small amount that’s unlikely to trigger symptoms in people with  gluten intolerance  ( 1 ).
A gluten-free seal means that the product has been independently tested by a third party, such as NSF International, to ensure it meets these requirements.
The Gluten Intolerance Group’s gluten-free label goes one step further, requiring fewer than 10 ppm ( 2 ,  3 ).
Furthermore, you can quickly check to verify that the ingredients list includes only corn or cornstarch.
Most cornstarch is naturally gluten-free, as it’s made by extracting the starch from corn. All the same, you should look for gluten-free certification to minimize the risk of gluten cross-contamination.

Substitutes for cornstarch
If you don’t have cornstarch on hand, several other gluten-free ingredients  make good replacements  — though you may need to use a little more or less to get the same effect. These include:
Rice flour.  Made from finely ground rice, rice flour replaces cornstarch in a 3:1 ratio.
Arrowroot powder.  Derived from the tropical arrowroot plant, this powder replaces cornstarch in a 2:1 ratio. Be sure to whisk it well, as it can become clumpy.
Potato starch.  This can replace cornstarch in a 1:1 ratio but should be added toward the end of a recipe to ensure thickness.
Tapioca starch.  Extracted from the root vegetable cassava, tapioca starch replaces cornstarch in a 2:1 ratio.
Flaxseed gel.  Mix 1 tablespoon of ground flax seeds with 4 tablespoons (60 mL) of water to make a gel. This replaces 2 tablespoons of cornstarch.
Xanthan gum.  This vegetable gum is made by fermenting sugar with certain bacteria. A little bit goes a long way, so it’s best to start with a small amount like 1/4 teaspoon and add more as needed.
Guar gum.  Like  xanthan gum , this vegetable gum made from guar beans should be used in very small amounts.
To minimize any risk of gluten cross-contamination with these products, look for gluten-free certification on the packaging.
Several gluten-free thickening agents are neutral in flavor and can replace cornstarch in most recipes.

The bottom line
Cornstarch is derived from corn, a naturally gluten-free grain. As no other ingredients are required to make it, it’s generally  gluten-free .
However, some cornstarch may harbor trace amounts if it was manufactured in a facility that also makes gluten-containing products.
To determine if your cornstarch is gluten-free, make sure the ingredients list contains nothing but corn or cornstarch. You should also choose products that are certified gluten-free.
Alternatively, you can use other gluten-free thickening agents like flaxseed gel or  arrowroot powder  in place of cornstarch. If you’re sensitive to gluten, it’s best to look for a gluten-free label on these products as well.
