You can take ashwagandha any time of day or night. For example, it can be taken in the morning along with other supplements. But, it’s best to take ashwagandha with food to avoid an upset stomach.

However, ashwagandha may lead to stomach upset for some people, so choosing the right time to take it may help you reap the greatest benefits without any side effects.

Ashwagandha uses
Ashwagandha supplements  have recently soared in popularity as a natural remedy that may provide various benefits, including reduced blood sugar, stress, and anxiety levels, as well as improved sleep and immune health ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
Most commonly, people choose to take ashwagandha for its adaptogenic properties, which are believed to help regulate the body’s  natural stress response  ( 2 ,  3 ).
Ashwagandha is usually available in tablet, capsule, or powdered form. It’s also available as an oil or cream, as well as in other cosmetic products.

When to take ashwagandha
In general, you can take ashwagandha  any time of day or night . However, you may prefer to take it in the morning or evening, depending on your goals and tolerance.
Unlike many other supplements and medications, ashwagandha’s benefits are not immediate. It can take days to weeks before you begin to notice its effects.
For example, in one study including 60 people who took 300 mg of ashwagandha daily, it took upward of 10 weeks for them to observe its full effects on their  sleep quality , compared with those in the control group ( 6 ).
As such, choosing when to take ashwagandha largely depends on your personal preference.
If you’re taking ashwagandha as part of your  supplement routine  for general health, you may wish to take it in the morning along with any other vitamins or supplements.
That said, taking ashwagandha on an empty stomach may lead to mild stomach discomfort in some people. Therefore, you may wish to take ashwagandha after breakfast or after eating a small snack.
Alternatively, you can try adding ashwagandha to a smoothie, drink, or other meals.
If used to promote sleep, you may opt for ashwagandha powder in  moon milk  before bed to help you relax.
For people who experience stomach discomfort when taking ashwagandha, taking it at night may be a better option than taking it in the morning, especially if you prefer taking it on an empty stomach.
All things considered, it’s most important to choose a time when you’ll be most consistent in taking it, as well as that feels best for you.
Ashwagandha can be taken in the morning, at night, or at any other time of the day. Timing will mostly depend on your personal preferences, tolerance, and the type of ashwagandha you choose to take.

In some cases, high doses — usually those beyond the recommended dose suggested on the package — may lead to stomach upset,  diarrhea , or vomiting.
Therefore, it’s important to follow the instructions on the label and speak with your healthcare provider before changing doses.
In rare cases, liver problems have been reported, though this may be due to other contaminants found in unregulated supplements. Be sure to purchase ashwagandha from a  trusted supplement company  ( 11 ).
Finally, you should consult your healthcare provider before taking ashwagandha if you’re pregnant, breastfeeding, or taking immunosuppressants, sedatives, antidepressants, or other medications ( 12 ).
