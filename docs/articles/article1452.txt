Title: Can Ginger Boost Your Sex Drive?

Ginger is a plant with powerful medicinal properties, and it’s often used to treat a variety of issues and ailments ( 1 ).
It has also long been used as a natural stimulant in many forms of traditional medicine to increase sexual arousal and libido naturally ( 2 ).
In fact, it’s believed that Madame du Barry, the famed mistress of King Louis XV, often served ginger to her lovers to help set the mood, thanks to its aphrodisiac effects.
This article takes an in-depth look at the research and benefits of ginger to determine whether it can  boost your sex drive .

Increases blood flow
While there’s limited research on the effects of ginger on sex drive directly, research shows that  ginger  can increase blood flow, which may help enhance sexual arousal and libido ( 3 ,  4 ).
One review of 6 studies also concluded that ginger supplementation reduced levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( 5 ).
Though further research is needed, this could be especially beneficial for  libido , as studies have found that increased blood pressure is associated with a higher risk of sexual dysfunction in both men and women ( 6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ).
Other research shows that ginger can also prevent blood clots and help dilate the blood vessels to support better blood flow, which could, in turn, increase arousal ( 10 ,  11 ).
Ginger may help reduce blood pressure levels and increase blood flow, which could enhance arousal and sexual function in both men and women.

Reduces oxidative stress
Oxidative stress is a condition characterized by an imbalance of free radicals and antioxidants in your body, leading to  inflammation  and cell damage ( 12 ).
While more research is needed, some studies suggest that oxidative stress could even negatively impact fertility and sexual function ( 13 ,  14 ).
Ginger has been well studied for its ability to alleviate inflammation and decrease oxidative stress in the body ( 15 ,  16 ).
Test-tube and animal studies show that ginger may help reduce oxidative stress and other age-related changes to cells and tissues when combined with other ingredients, which could help treat  erectile dysfunction  ( 17 ,  18 ).
Still, more studies are needed to determine how the anti-inflammatory properties of ginger specifically could affect sex drive in humans.
Ginger can decrease oxidative stress and inflammation, which may be beneficial for promoting fertility and sexual function.

May improve fertility
Interestingly, some research has found that ginger could  enhance fertility  for men and women alike.
According to one review, animal studies show that ginger could increase testosterone production by enhancing blood flow, reducing oxidative stress, and increasing levels of luteinizing hormone, which is involved in testosterone synthesis ( 19 ).
Ginger may also enhance semen quality by improving the concentration, motility, and viability of sperm cells ( 20 ,  21 ).
Another animal study found that ginger could benefit female fertility by improving the process of folliculogenesis, which is the maturation of the ovarian follicle ( 22 ).
Additionally, one animal study showed that administering high doses of ginger extract balanced hormone levels in rats with  polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) , a condition that can negatively affect fertility in women ( 23 ,  24 ).
Further research should be conducted to understand whether ginger can affect fertility and reproductive health in humans when used as an herb or supplement.
Animal studies show that ginger could support male and female fertility by decreasing oxidative stress, improving sperm quality, and balancing hormone levels.

The bottom line
If you’re looking to rev up your sex drive, adding ginger to your diet may be a good option.
In fact, research suggests that it could increase blood flow, reduce  oxidative stress,  and enhance fertility among both men and women.
However, keep in mind that studies in humans are still very limited, and test-tube and animal studies often use highly concentrated ginger extracts. As such, more research on ginger’s direct effects on sex drive in humans is still needed.
Try this today:  Add some ginger to your diet. Brew up a hot cup of  ginger tea  or try ginger in a stir-fry, sauce, or dessert.
