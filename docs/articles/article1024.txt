Title: Feta Cheese: Good or Bad?

Feta cheese is a soft, white, and brined cheese. It’s originally from Greece and is used in many Mediterranean dishes. That said, it may not be recommended for people with certain health conditions.
Feta is the most well-known cheese in Greece, and is used in dishes ranging from appetizers to desserts.
It’s a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) product, meaning that only cheese made in some areas of Greece can be called “feta” ( 1 ).
In these regions, feta is made with milk from sheep and goats raised on local grass. This particular environment is what gives the cheese its unique characteristics.
Feta’s flavor is tangy and sharp when it’s made with sheep’s milk, but milder when combined with goat’s milk.
Feta is produced in blocks and is firm to the touch. However, it can crumble when cut and has a creamy mouth feel.
Feta cheese is a Greek cheese made from sheep and goat’s milk. It has a tangy, sharp flavor and a creamy texture in the mouth.

How Is It Made?
Genuine Greek feta is made from sheep’s milk or a mixture of sheep and goat’s milk.
However, goat’s milk cannot be more than 30% of the mixture ( 1 ).
The milk used to make the cheese is usually pasteurized, but it can also be raw.
After the milk is pasteurized, lactic acid starter cultures are added to separate the whey from the curds, which are made of the protein  casein . Then, rennet is added to set the casein.
Once this process is complete, the curd is shaped by draining the whey and placing the curd in molds for 24 hours.
Once the curd is firm, it is cut into cubes, salted and placed in wooden barrels or metal containers for up to three days. Next, the blocks of cheese are placed in a salted solution and refrigerated for two months.
Finally, when the cheese is ready to be distributed to consumers, it is packaged in this solution (called brine) to preserve freshness.
Feta cheese is a brined cheese that is shaped into cubes. It is stored in salted water and matured for only two months.

Feta Cheese Is Packed With Nutrients
Feta cheese seems to be a healthy choice. One ounce (28 grams) provides ( 2 ):
Calories:  74
Fat:  6 grams
Protein:  4 grams
Carbs:  1.1 grams
Riboflavin:  14% of the RDI
Calcium:  14% of the RDI
Sodium:  13% of the RDI
Phosphorus:  9% of the RDI
Vitamin B12:  8% of the RDI
Selenium:  6% of the RDI
Vitamin B6:  6% of the RDI
Zinc:  5% of the RDI
It also has decent amounts of vitamins A and K,  folate , pantothenic acid, iron and magnesium ( 2 ).
What’s more, feta is lower in fat and calories than aged cheeses like cheddar or parmesan.
One ounce (28 grams) of cheddar or parmesan contains more than 110  calories  and 7 grams of fat, while 1 ounce of feta has only 74 calories and 6 grams of fat ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
Additionally, it contains more calcium and B vitamins than other cheeses like mozzarella, ricotta, cottage cheese or goat cheese ( 2 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ).
Feta cheese is a low-calorie, low-fat cheese. It is also a good source of B vitamins, calcium and phosphorus.

It Can Support Bone Health
Cheese seems to be the primary source of  calcium  in Western diets ( 9 ).
Feta cheese is a good source of calcium, phosphorus and  protein , all of which have been proven to promote bone health ( 10 ).
Calcium and protein help maintain bone density and prevent osteoporosis, while phosphorus is an important component of bone ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ,  12 ).
Each serving of feta provides almost twice as much calcium as phosphorus, a proportion shown to have positive effects on bone health ( 2 ,  13 ,  14 ).
Furthermore, milk from sheep and goats contains more calcium and phosphorus than cow’s milk. Therefore, incorporating cheeses like feta into your diet could help you achieve the recommended daily intake of  calcium  ( 15 ,  16 ,  17 ).
Calcium and phosphorus are present in feta cheese in amounts that can help support bone health.

Feta Cheese Is Good for Your Gut
Probiotics  are live, friendly bacteria that can benefit your health.
Feta has been shown to contain  Lactobacillus plantarum , which accounts for about 48% of its bacteria ( 18 ,  19 ,  20 ,  21 ).
These bacteria can help promote immune system and  gut health  by protecting the intestinal tract from disease-causing bacteria like  E. coli  and  Salmonella  ( 22 ).
Furthermore, they seem to increase the production of compounds that inhibit the inflammatory response, thus providing  anti-inflammatory  benefits ( 22 ,  23 ).
Finally, test-tube studies have shown that the bacteria and other yeast strains found in this cheese can grow at a low pH, surviving extreme conditions in your gut, such as bile acid ( 18 ,  22 ,  24 ).
Feta cheese contains friendly bacteria that have been shown to promote immune and intestinal health, in addition to their anti-inflammatory effects.

It Contains Beneficial Fatty Acids
Conjugated linoleic acid  (CLA) is a fatty acid found in animal products.
It has been shown to help improve body composition, decreasing fat mass and increasing lean body mass. CLA may also help prevent diabetes and has shown anti-cancer effects ( 25 ,  26 ).
Cheeses made with sheep’s milk have a higher CLA concentration than cheeses made with milk from cows or goats. In fact, feta cheese contains up to 1.9% CLA, which accounts for 0.8% of its fat content ( 27 ,  28 ).
Even though its CLA content decreases while it’s being processed and stored, a study has shown that the use of bacterial cultures in the making of the cheese could help increase the concentration of CLA ( 1 ,  29 ).
Therefore, eating feta cheese could contribute to your intake of CLA and provide you with all of the benefits it offers.
Interestingly enough, Greece has the lowest incidence of breast cancer and the highest consumption of cheese in the European Union ( 28 ).
Feta cheese contains good amounts of CLA, which may improve body composition and help prevent diabetes and cancer.

Potential Problems With Feta
Feta cheese is a good source of nutrients. However, due to how its made and the types of milk used, it could have some drawbacks.
During the cheese-making process,  salt  is added to the curd. Additionally, during storage, the cheese block needs to be submerged in a brine of up to 7% salt.
The finished product is a cheese that’s  high in sodium . In fact, feta cheese contains 312 mg of sodium in a 1-ounce (28-gram) serving, which can account for up to 13% of your RDI ( 2 ).
If you’re sensitive to salt, one simple way to reduce the salt content of this cheese is to rinse the cheese with water before eating it.
Unripened cheeses tend to be higher in  lactose  than aged cheeses.
Since feta cheese is an unripened cheese, it has a higher lactose content than some other cheeses.
People who are allergic or intolerant to lactose should avoid eating unripened cheeses, including feta.
Listeria monocytogenes  is a type of bacteria found in water and soil that can contaminate crops and animals ( 30 ).
Pregnant women  are usually advised to  avoid consuming  raw vegetables and meats, as well as unpasteurized dairy products, because they have the potential to be contaminated with these bacteria.
Cheeses made with unpasteurized milk have a higher risk of carrying the bacteria than cheeses made with pasteurized milk. Similarly, fresh cheeses have a higher risk of carrying it than aged cheeses, due to higher moisture content ( 30 ).
Therefore, feta cheese made with unpasteurized milk is not recommended for pregnant women.
Feta cheese has a higher sodium and lactose content than some other cheeses. Also, when made with unpasteurized milk, it has the potential to be contaminated with  Listeria  bacteria.
