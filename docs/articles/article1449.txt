Title: Are Egg Noodles Healthy? Benefits and Downsides

Featured in recipes like stir-fries, chicken noodle soup, and buttered noodles, egg noodles are a staple ingredient in many types of cuisine.
They’re made using wheat flour and eggs, which are mixed and formed into a dough, cut into flat strips, and then cooked in boiling water.
However, while there’s no doubt that egg noodles are delicious, many people may wonder whether they’re a healthy choice.
This article examines the nutrition of egg noodles, as well as their benefits and downsides.

Benefits
Egg noodles’ nutritional content is similar to that of  regular pasta  but slightly lower in calories, carbs, and protein ( 1 ,  2 ).
They’re also often enriched, meaning that certain vitamins and minerals have been added, increasing their nutritional value.
One cup (160 grams) of cooked, enriched egg noodles contains ( 1 ):
Calories:  221
Protein:  7 grams
Fat:  3 grams
Carbs:  40 grams
Fiber:  2 grams
Selenium:  70% of the Daily Value (DV)
Thiamine:  39% of the DV
Folate:  55% of the DV
Manganese:  22% of the DV
Niacin:  21% of the DV
Copper:  17% of the DV
Riboflavin:  17% of the DV
Iron:  13% of the DV
Zinc:  10% of the DV
Enriched egg noodles are particularly high in  selenium , a mineral that plays a key role in immune function ( 3 ).
They also contain several B vitamins like thiamine, folate,  niacin , and riboflavin, all of which are involved in energy production, DNA repair, and brain health ( 4 ).
Furthermore, enriched egg noodles are a good source of manganese, an essential nutrient that acts as an antioxidant to protect against oxidative stress and cell damage ( 5 ).
Egg noodles are often enriched and provide several key vitamins and minerals, including selenium, manganese, and B vitamins.

Potential downsides
Egg noodles deliver key nutrients, but they’re also associated with several potential downsides.
Egg noodles contain a good amount of calories per serving, with approximately 221 calories in each cooked cup (160 grams) ( 1 ).
This is slightly higher than other types of pasta like penne, which contains around 168 calories per cup (107 grams) ( 2 ).
Egg noodles are denser, so you’re also getting more noodles in a 1-cup portion.
While egg noodles can definitely fit into a healthy diet, it’s important to be mindful of the toppings that you choose, especially if you’re working toward a weight loss goal.
This is because egg noodles are often combined with other high calorie ingredients like butter and cheese, which may contribute to weight gain if consumed in high amounts.
On the other hand, pairing egg noodles with ingredients that are  low in calories  and  high in protein  or fiber may be beneficial, as this can help keep you feeling fuller for longer to support weight loss ( 6 ,  7 ).
Egg noodles have a moderate  glycemic index , which is a measure used to estimate the extent to which specific foods increase your blood sugar levels ( 8 ).
They typically have a higher glycemic index than pasta, although this can vary depending on the specific type of pasta and cooking method used.
For example, boiled wheat egg noodles have a glycemic index of 57, while the glycemic index of spaghetti can range from 42–58 ( 8 ).
Egg noodles are also relatively high in carbohydrates, with over 40 grams in each cup (160 grams) ( 1 ).
Studies show that following high carb diets that contain a higher proportion of low fiber starches could be linked to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, a group of conditions that may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke ( 9 ,  10 ).
Their carb content makes them inappropriate for very low carb diets like the  ketogenic diet .
Egg noodles are made using wheat flour, which contains gluten, a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye.
Although gluten is not an issue for most people, some may need to limit their intake.
For people with celiac disease or a sensitivity to gluten, in particular, consuming foods that contain gluten can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea,  stomach pain , and unintentional weight loss ( 11 ,  12 ).
Following a  gluten-free diet  is recommended to prevent adverse side effects for those who are unable to tolerate gluten.
Egg noodles provide a good amount of calories and carbs per serving. They also have a moderate glycemic index and contain gluten.

Are they healthy?
Egg noodles can be enjoyed in moderation as part of a  well-rounded diet .
Still, it’s important to consider which foods you’re pairing them with to maximize the dish’s nutritional value and minimize its adverse health effects.
For example, toppings like  butter , cheese, and cream-based sauces can ramp up the calorie content quickly, which could lead to weight gain.
Opting for nutrient-dense ingredients that are high in protein or fiber can be a better option if you’re watching your weight or hoping to support healthy  blood sugar levels  while squeezing some extra vitamins and minerals into your diet.
Try pairing your egg noodles with protein-rich foods like chicken, fish, or tofu, as well as fiber-filled veggies to get the most bang for your nutritional buck.
Additionally, watch your portion sizes and try to stick to around 1 cup (160 grams) of cooked egg noodles per serving. Bulking up your egg noodles with vegetables and protein can help you feel more satisfied with your meal without going overboard on pasta.
Choosing healthy toppings and monitoring your portion sizes can help ensure that egg noodles can fit into a well-balanced diet.

The bottom line
Egg noodles are a  pantry staple  for many, thanks to both their versatility and rich flavor.
They’re often enriched with vitamins and minerals and contain nutrients like manganese, selenium, and B vitamins.
However, they are also high in carbs, contain gluten, and could contribute to weight gain if consumed in high amounts.
Therefore, while egg noodles can definitely fit into a healthy diet, it’s important to watch your portion size and be mindful of which ingredients you pair them with.
Try this today. Egg noodles make a great addition to veggie-filled  stir-fries . You can also bump up your dish’s protein content by adding chicken, beef, or tofu.
