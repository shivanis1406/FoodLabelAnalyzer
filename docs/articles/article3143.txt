Title: 8 Health and Nutrition Benefits of Jicama

Jicama contains vitamins, minerals, and beneficial fiber. It may benefit heart health and your gut microbiome as part of a nutritious diet.
Jicama is a globe-shaped root vegetable with papery, golden-brown skin and a starchy white interior.
Originally grown in Mexico, jicama farms are now found worldwide in warm places  like  Central America, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa, among others.
Its flesh is juicy and crunchy, with a slightly sweet and nutty flavor. Some think it tastes like a cross between a potato and a pear. Others compare it to a water chestnut.
Other names for jicama include yam bean, Kuzu-imo, Mexican potato, Mexican water chestnut, and Chinese turnip.
Here are 8 health and nutrition benefits of jicama.

1. Packed with nutrients
Jicama has an impressive nutrient profile.
One cup (130 grams [g]) contains the  following nutrients :
Calories:  49
Carbs:  11.5 g
Protein:  1 g
Fat:  0.1 g
Fiber:  6.4 g
Vitamin C:  29% of the RDA
Folate:  4% of the RDA
Iron:  4% of the RDA
Magnesium:  4% of the RDA
Potassium:  6% of the RDA
Manganese:  4% of the RDA
Most of jicama’s calories come from carbs. The rest are from very small amounts of protein and fat. Jicama contains many important vitamins and minerals, as well as a significant amount of fiber.

2. High in antioxidants
Jicama contains several  antioxidants , which are beneficial plant compounds that help prevent cell damage.
One cup (130 g) of jicama contains  26.3 mg  of vitamin C, nearly  one-third  of the RDA for adult males and 35% of the RDA for adult females. It also contains the antioxidants  vitamin E ,  selenium , and  beta-carotene .
Antioxidants help protect against cell damage by counteracting free radicals, the harmful molecules that cause oxidative stress.
Oxidative stress  has been linked to several chronic diseases,  including  cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cognitive decline.
A  2021 review  found that many antioxidants and phytochemicals in the jicama leaves, seeds, and tubular may help fight oxidative stress and decrease the risk of developing chronic diseases.

3. May boost heart health
Jicama has several nutrients that make it an excellent choice for improving  heart health .
For instance, one cup (130 g) of jicama contains  6.4 g  of  fiber , which is around  one-fifth  of the recommended daily intake for adults.
According to a  2018 review , fiber may help decrease the risk of heart disease and stroke. It could also help lower  LDL “bad” cholesterol  and  blood pressure , which are two key risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
A  2016 study  also found that consuming 16.6 ounces (500 mL) of jicama juice helped reduce the risk of developing blood clots and lowered  diastolic blood pressure  — both risk factors for heart disease and stroke.

4. Promotes digestion
Dietary fiber may  help you  regulate or improve digestion by softening and bulking stool and increasing gastric emptying in the gut. This could help stool move more smoothly through your digestive tract.
One cup (130 g) of jicama contains  6.4 g  of fiber, which can help you meet your daily goals.
Additionally, jicama contains  inulin, a type of fiber that may  help  relieve  constipation, lower blood sugar, and reduce inflammation, among other benefits.
Jicama is also high in water, which may help  ease constipation  by helping you meet your daily fluid needs.

5. Good for your gut bacteria
Jicama is high in inulin, which is a prebiotic fiber.
A  prebiotic  is a substance that can be fermented in your body by the bacteria in your gut, known as probiotics.
A diet high in prebiotics  may help  increase the population of “good” bacteria in your gut and decrease the number of unhealthy bacteria.
A  2019 study  in mice with diabetes found that probiotic yogurt made with jicama helped lower blood sugar levels more than regular probiotic yogurt. The authors suggest this may be due to the presence of inulin.
Eating  prebiotic foods  like jicama may  promote  the growth of bacteria that may help reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, obesity, and kidney disease.
Gut bacteria  like inulin may also play a role in weight management, metabolism, immune function, and mood.

6. May reduce the risk of cancer
A  2021 review  found that jicama’s anticancer properties may be due to the presence of the phytochemical rotenone, which has been shown to have several anticancer effects.
The authors note that rotenone is a toxin that could cause side effects. However, they add that two derivatives, rotenoisin A and rotenoisin B, have recently been developed and may help in the treatment of  breast  and  liver  cancers.
In a  2014 study , researchers purified a ribosome-inactivating protein from the seeds of jicama, called pachyerosin. They found that pachyerosin may play a role in treating gastric cancer because it helps prevent the growth of human hepatoma cells.
Jicama also contains antioxidants, fiber, and prebiotics, which have all been linked to helping fight cancer.

7. May aid weight loss
Jicama is a nutrient-dense food. It contains a high number of nutrients but a relatively low number of calories.
A  2019 animal study  found that supplementing with jicama helped promote weight loss and prevent blood glucose spikes in mice fed a high sugar diet.
Jicama is high in fiber, which has been shown to  help promote  weight loss by increasing feelings of fullness, reducing appetite, and boosting metabolism.
Jicama may also help promote weight loss due to its effects on insulin resistance, which is a contributor to  obesity .
It occurs when cells become less sensitive to insulin, making it harder for glucose to enter the cells and be used for energy. Instead, the glucose stays in your bloodstream, raising your blood sugar levels.
A  2015 study  in mice found that eating jicama may  increase insulin sensitivity  and decrease blood sugar levels.

8. Extremely versatile
Jicama can be eaten raw or cooked and used in a wide variety of dishes.
After removing the tough, brownish peel, the white flesh can be cut into slices or cubes.
Here are some ways to add jicama to your diet:
Add it to a vegetable salad for extra crunch.
Combine with mango, pineapple, or papaya for a tropical fruit salad.
Cut it into thick slices and serve with a dip like guacamole or hummus.
Add it to a vegetable platter.
Stir-fry it with sesame oil and rice vinegar.
Sprinkle it with lime juice and chili powder for a spicy snack.
