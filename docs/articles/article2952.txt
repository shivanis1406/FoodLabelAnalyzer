Title: The 12 Best Zinc Supplements, According to Dietitians

Zinc is an essential micronutrient that’s needed for a number of critical processes in your body. For example, zinc plays an important role in immune function, cell division, and protein and DNA synthesis ( 1 ).
While there are many food sources of zinc, including meat and shellfish, some people may be at a higher risk for not getting enough zinc in their diets ( 1 ).
For example, pregnant or lactating women, vegetarians and vegans, people with gastrointestinal disorders, individuals taking certain medications like diuretics, and those who drink alcohol excessively are at a higher risk of developing a zinc deficiency ( 1 ,  2 ).
They may benefit from a zinc supplement ( 1 ,  2 ).
Keep reading for our picks of the best zinc supplements, as well as tips on how to choose a product that’s right for you.

How to choose zinc supplements
When choosing a  zinc supplement , it’s important to consider the type of zinc, dosage, supplement form, and product quality.
There are several types of zinc supplements. Limited research suggests that some forms, such as zinc picolinate and zinc citrate, may be better absorbed than others, like zinc oxide. However, more recent studies are needed ( 3 ,  4 ).
Most zinc supplements contain 15–30 mg of zinc per serving. Keep in mind the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of zinc is 40 mg per day for adults, 4–7 mg per day for infants, 7–23 mg per day for kids, and 23–34 mg per day for teens ( 1 ).
Due to potential side effects of excess zinc, it’s best not to exceed 40 mg per day unless under medical supervision.
Taking  too much zinc  can cause negative side effects, such as decreased immune function, low copper levels, and reduced HDL (good) cholesterol levels ( 1 ).
Zinc supplements are available as capsules, lozenges, and liquids. For people who cannot or prefer not to swallow pills, liquid forms are likely a better option.
Before buying any supplement, it’s important to research high quality, trustworthy brands to ensure both safety and quality.
Look for supplements that are produced by reputable manufacturers and free of large amounts of added ingredients like fillers, additives, and preservatives.
A good way to ensure high quality is to look for products that have been certified by a third-party organization such as  NSF International  or  Underwriters Laboratories .

Frequently asked questions
Studies suggest that  zinc  supplements may help support wound healing and immune response, improve certain aspects of skin health, reduce the length and severity of respiratory infections, and lower markers of oxidative stress ( 11 ,  12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ).
However, while zinc supplements may be helpful for some people, most healthy adults can meet their zinc needs through diet alone.
Currently, there’s a lack of recent studies investigating the absorbability of zinc supplements.
However, older research suggests that certain forms, including zinc picolinate, zinc bisglycinate, and zinc citrate, may be better absorbed than others, such as zinc oxide ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
There’s a lack of recent research investigating which form of zinc is best for immune health.
One meta-analysis from 2017 concluded that lozenges containing zinc acetate were effective at  shortening the duration  of cold symptoms by nearly 33% ( 8 ).
Nevertheless, the evidence is mixed and insufficient to determine which form of zinc is best for immune health.
When taken in supplement form at doses of less than 40 mg daily, zinc is unlikely to cause negative or harmful side effects.
However, daily zinc supplementation at moderate or high doses over longer periods has been associated with low copper status, reduced immune function, and altered  iron  function ( 1 ).
Signs of excess zinc intake may include decreased appetite, nausea or vomiting, headaches, upset stomach, and diarrhea. This can occur in either an acute or chronic time frame depending on the dosage ( 1 ).
Zinc is found in foods such as beans, nuts,  fortified cereals , grains, and dairy products ( 1 ).
It’s important to consult a qualified health professional to assess your overall diet quality before starting zinc supplementation.
The UL for zinc is currently set at 40 mg per day. Avoid consuming more than 40 mg per day unless under medical supervision ( 1 ).
Taking too much zinc can cause negative side effects, such as decreased immune function,  low copper levels , and reduced HDL (good) cholesterol levels ( 1 ).
Taking too much zinc from high dose zinc supplements can lead to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and headaches.
Additionally, taking in too much zinc over longer time periods can cause negative side effects such as decreased immune function, low copper levels, and reduced HDL (good) cholesterol levels ( 1 ).

The bottom line
Zinc is an essential nutrient that you need to get enough of in your  diet . Certain populations may benefit from zinc supplements.
Of course, not all supplements are created equal. It’s important to look for high quality products that have been tested to ensure quality and accuracy.
If you’re concerned about your zinc intake, talk with a healthcare professional to see whether a zinc supplement is a good option and to find an optimal dose.
