If you’ve been to a grocery or convenience store lately, you’ve probably seen bottles and cans of cold brew coffee, kombucha, iced tea, juice, and flavored water lining the shelves.
Some of them even have labels like “immunity boost” or “with antioxidant vitamin C” — but what does that actually mean?

What is an antioxidant drink?
Antioxidant drinks are any type of beverage made with one or more ingredients that are rich in antioxidants, such as fruits, vegetables, coffee, or tea.
Antioxidants are compounds that play a central role in health and disease.
They help by neutralizing harmful compounds known as free radicals. This can reduce oxidative damage to your cells and may help lessen inflammation and protect against chronic disease ( 1 ).
Switching up your diet is one of the most effective ways to increase your intake of antioxidants.
Still, while most people are familiar with antioxidant-rich foods like fruits and veggies, finding healthy antioxidant drinks can be a bit more challenging.

Derived from the leaves of the  Camellia sinensis  plant,  green tea  is one of the most popular antioxidant drinks.
It’s particularly rich in a  polyphenol  called epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a compound that has been extensively studied for its antioxidant effects ( 2 ).
Green tea also provides several other antioxidant compounds, including flavonols like myricetin, quercetin, and chlorogenic acid ( 3 ).
Pure Leaf Unsweetened Green Tea is made without any added colors, artificial sweeteners, or other questionable ingredients. It’s also brewed using fresh tea leaves rather than powders and concentrates, which can help maximize the taste and quality of your beverage.

Matcha is a type of tea made from the leaves of the green tea plant. The leaves are ground into a fine powder, added to hot water, and whisked with a bamboo brush until a frothy texture is formed. Unlike regular green tea,  matcha  is made using the entire leaf of the tea plant, resulting in a higher concentration of antioxidants ( 4 ). In test-tube and animal studies, matcha extract has been shown to protect against liver damage and decrease cancer cell growth ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ). What’s more, a small study in 23 people found that consuming matcha improved memory, attention, and reaction time, compared with a placebo ( 8 ). Moontower Matcha is made using ceremonial-grade matcha, a type of matcha with a more delicate, refreshing flavor and less of a bitter taste than culinary-grade matcha. It also contains zero grams of sugar and is free of artificial ingredients and flavors to ensure that you’re getting the highest quality matcha available.

Coffee is an excellent source of disease-fighting antioxidants.
In fact, not only is coffee one of the most widely consumed beverages around the globe, but research shows that it may also be  one of the main sources of antioxidants  in the average diet ( 13 ,  14 ,  15 ).
In particular, coffee is loaded with antioxidants like caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, catechin, quercetin, and rutin ( 16 ).
Interestingly, one very large review of 218 studies found that drinking 3–4 cups (720–960 mL) of coffee per day may be associated with a lower risk of heart disease, liver concerns, and certain types of cancer ( 17 ).
This  cold brew coffee  is free of sugar and dairy and can be a great option for those looking to bump up their intake of antioxidants and caffeine.
It’s also available in a variety of flavors, including Double Espresso, Salted Caramel, Dark Chocolate Mocha, and Creamy Cappuccino.
However, keep in mind that these varieties may contain dairy and additional flavorings and ingredients, depending on the type.

Beets  are packed with beneficial antioxidant compounds like betalains, the plant pigments that give beets their vibrant hue ( 18 ,  19 ).
Due to their antioxidant content, beets have been linked to a long list of health benefits. They may help reduce inflammation and improve heart health ( 20 ,  21 ,  22 ).
Featuring beet juice and strawberry, apple, raspberry, and  bilberry  juice, this Beetology drink is brimming with antioxidants.

Pomegranates are incredibly rich in antioxidants, with research showing that the antioxidant potential of pomegranate juice may be higher than that of both red wine and green tea ( 23 ).
What’s more, studies suggest that  pomegranate  juice may significantly reduce inflammation, lower blood pressure, and protect against the buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries ( 24 ,  25 ).
This product contains 100% pomegranate juice from concentrate and is made without any added sugars or genetically modified (GMO) ingredients.
It’s also a great source of  potassium , which is an essential nutrient that regulates muscle contractions, fluid balance, blood pressure, and more ( 26 ).
However, because this beverage contains a good amount of natural sugars without any of the fiber found in whole fruit, be sure to moderate your intake and pair it with a balanced diet.

Native to Central and South America, the  acai berry  is a tropical fruit loaded with antioxidants like orientin, isoorientin, and vanillic acid ( 27 ).
According to a small study in 7 athletes, drinking a juice blend with acai berry daily increased antioxidant levels in the blood and reduced cholesterol levels and exercise-induced muscle damage after 6 weeks ( 28 ).
While more research in humans is needed, test-tube and animal studies also suggest that acai may reduce  oxidative stress  and improve brain health ( 29 ,  30 ,  31 ).
Made from acai juice and a blend of vegetable juices with apple juice, white grape juice, and blueberry juice, this drink can definitely help squeeze some extra antioxidants into your diet.
Although this juice is made without any added sugar or artificial sweeteners, keep in mind that it contains a good amount of natural sugars from fruit.
That’s why it’s important to enjoy it in moderation as part of a healthy, well-rounded diet.

Vitamin C in particular is a water-soluble vitamin with powerful antioxidant properties ( 32 ). In addition to neutralizing the effects of harmful free radicals, vitamin C can help  regulate inflammation  and oxidative stress ( 33 ).
Besides Prickly Pear Lemonade, several other flavors are available and offer a similar amount of antioxidants, including Mandarin Orange, Tropical Berry, Crisp Cucumber, and Perfect Peach.

Meanwhile, kale is a great  source of vitamin K , along with antioxidants like kaempferol and quercetin ( 41 ,  42 ).
Dill has also been studied for its medicinal properties and may aid in managing diabetes and heart disease ( 43 ,  44 ).

How do these drinks compare?

How to choose
When selecting a healthy antioxidant drink, there are several factors to consider.
First,  check the ingredient label  carefully and steer clear of products that contain added sugar, artificial flavors, and additives.
Ingredients like cane juice, high fructose corn syrup, glucose, or fruit nectar generally indicate that a drink contains added sugars.
The amount of added sugar is listed on the nutrition facts panel of a product.
Plus, keep in mind that ingredients are listed in order by quantity, with those present in the greatest amount appearing first. Ideally, antioxidant-rich ingredients like fruits, veggies, coffee, or tea should appear at the beginning of the list to ensure that you’re getting the most bang for your buck.
For caffeinated beverages, you may also want to consider the  caffeine  content of your drink.
While caffeine is required to be listed on the product label, manufacturers in the United States are not required to disclose the specific amount ( 45 ).
For those limiting their caffeine intake, this information may be obtained online or directly from the manufacturer.

Do antioxidant drinks have any side effects?
Though most antioxidant drinks are not associated with any side effects when enjoyed in moderation, there are some side effects to consider.
For starters, some drinks may contain caffeine, including certain types of tea or coffee.
Consuming high amounts of caffeine can cause side effects like anxiety, restlessness, and nausea for some people. Others may need to limit their intake, including those who are pregnant or nursing ( 45 ).
Some fruit-based beverages may also contain high amounts of natural sugars in each serving along with less fiber than the amount found in whole fruits.
Though these drinks can fit into a healthy, well-rounded diet, drinking excessive amounts could increase blood sugar levels in people with diabetes and may contribute to weight gain over time ( 46 ,  47 ).
You should also check the ingredients label carefully to find a product that works for you, especially if you have any food allergies, sensitivities, or intolerances.
Finally, some research suggests that consuming high amounts of antioxidants could actually be harmful and may be linked to a higher risk of certain types of cancer, but these risks are typically associated with high dose antioxidant supplements rather than those that naturally occur in foods and beverages ( 48 ).

Frequently asked questions about antioxidant drinks

Antioxidant drinks can be a great option for anyone looking to fit more antioxidants into their daily diet.
Keep in mind that certain drink varieties — such as those high in caffeine — may not be recommended for certain groups, including children and people who are pregnant or nursing ( 45 ).
Additionally, other types made with fruit may contain high amounts of natural sugars and should be enjoyed in moderation as part of a healthy diet.

The bottom line
