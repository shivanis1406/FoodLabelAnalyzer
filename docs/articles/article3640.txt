Title: What Is a Fasting Mimicking Diet?

A fasting mimicking diet is low in calories, carbohydrates, and protein. It allows your body to experience the health benefits of fasting while still eating certain types and amounts of food.
You’re not alone if you avoid fasting because you can’t stomach the thought of not eating anything at all. A solution to your concerns may be a fasting mimicking diet.
A fasting mimicking diet allows the consumption of some solids, and by keeping calorie and protein levels low, it extends many of the health benefits associated with fasting.
Potential benefits of this diet include:
maintaining lean muscle mass as you lose weight
improving your metabolism
reducing your blood pressure
supporting healthy aging
But, it’s worth noting that the fasting mimicking diet isn’t appropriate for everyone, and shouldn’t be done by those with certain medical conditions or who are pregnant and breastfeeding.
Always consult with a doctor or dietitian before beginning any new eating plan.

What is a fasting mimicking diet?
A  fasting mimicking diet  is a plant-based diet low in calories, carbohydrates, and protein.
The types and amounts of food prescribed in a  fasting mimicking diet  are chosen to provide essential nutrients while not activating your food sensing pathways, so that you can receive the benefits of prolonged fasting.
Some of the foods that may be included in a fasting mimicking diet are:
small amounts of nuts and seeds
vegetable-based broth soups
leafy greens (such as Kale, collard, and spinach)
herbal teas
A fasting mimicking diet may last from  4 to 7 days  and can be repeated every few weeks or every few months.  More research  is still needed to determine the ideal length of time and frequency for a fasting mimicking diet.
On a 5-day fasting mimicking diet, you’ll consume:
Day 1:  approximately  55%  of the usually recommended daily calories in specific foods
Days 2 to 5:  approximately  35%  of the recommended calories in certain foods and beverages
It’s important to follow your fasting mimicking diet plan precisely to keep your body in a fasting state and receive the health benefits.
Some prepackaged fasting mimicking diets (such as  ProLon ) allow some coffee. They recommend drinking no more than  140 mg of caffeine  each day. This is equivalent to:
one 8 to 12 ounce (oz) cup of black coffee, or
two cups of black or green caffeinated tea, or
six cups of decaffeinated coffee
There are no research studies to date on how caffeine affects fasting mimicking diets, or how much you should consume if you’re following such as diet.

What are the potential benefits of a fasting mimicking diet?
Potential benefits  of a fasting mimicking diet include:
losing weight while keeping lean muscle mass
promoting healthy aging
improving your metabolism
reducing inflammation
encouraging cellular rejuvenation
decreasing your blood pressure
improving cognitive abilities
More studies are still needed  to further understand the long-term benefits of a fasting mimicking diet.

Who should follow a fasting mimicking diet?
A fasting mimicking diet can be useful for those looking to lose weight. Individuals who are at a moderate weight and hoping to improve their overall health can also benefit.
Before beginning a fasting mimicking diet, it’s a good idea to meet with a doctor and discuss the number of days you plan to do it for and how frequently.
Certain people, such as those with certain medical conditions or who are pregnant or breastfeeding, shouldn’t follow this diet.

Is a fasting mimicking diet safe and what precautions should you be aware of?
Current research  indicates consuming a fasting mimicking diet for 5 days a month is a safe and effective way to experience many health benefits. But, there are  risks associated  with a fasting mimicking diet. You may experience:
dizziness
fainting
headaches
fatigue
general weakness
A fasting mimicking diet is  not appropriate for :
people who are pregnant or breastfeeding
those who are malnourished or fighting an infection
children younger than 18 years old and adults over the age of 70
people who are suffering from or have a history of  eating disorders
times when you will be engaging in strenuous activities or will be outdoors in extreme temperatures
Individuals with health conditions like  diabetes  or who are on medications should discuss the appropriateness of this diet as well as  any necessary monitoring  with a doctor.

Takeaway
A fasting mimicking diet is low enough in calories and protein to allow your body to continue experiencing the health benefits of fasting even though you’re still eating. These benefits can include lowered blood pressure, improved metabolism, and cellular rejuvenation.
A fasting mimicking diet isn’t appropriate for everyone. Always talk with a doctor before making any major changes to your diet or lifestyle.
Research is still ongoing to learn more about the long-term effects on humans of a fasting mimicking diet.
