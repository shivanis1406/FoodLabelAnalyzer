Title: 10 Impressive Benefits of Chayote Squash



Chayote squash boasts a nutrition profile that is loaded with essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. It may also support a healthy pregnancy, have anticancer properties, and slow visible signs of aging.
Chayote ( Sechium edule ) is a type of squash that belongs to the gourd family  Cucurbitaceae .
It originally hails from central Mexico and various parts of Latin America but is now grown all over the world. It’s also known as mirliton squash or chocho.
Chayote is loaded with an array of nutrients and antioxidant compounds that provide many potential health benefits.
Here are 10 impressive health benefits of chayote squash.

1. Rich in nutrients
One of the greatest attributes of chayote squash is its nutrition content, as it offers various essential vitamins, minerals, and  fiber .
A single chayote squash (203 grams) provides the following nutrients ( 1 ):
Calories:  39
Carbs:  9 grams
Protein:  2 grams
Fat:  0 grams
Fiber:  4 grams — 14%  of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI)
Vitamin C:  26% of the RDI
Vitamin B9 (folate):  47% of the RDI
Vitamin K:  10% of the RDI
Vitamin B6:  8% of the RDI
Manganese:  19% of the RDI
Copper:  12% of the RDI
Zinc:  10% of the RDI
Potassium:  7% of the RDI
Magnesium:  6% of the RDI
Notably, chayote is particularly high in folate, which promotes proper cell division.
Alongside its  nutrient density , chayote also happens to be low in calories, fat, sodium, and total carbs. As such, it’s quite healthy and makes for a good fit for various diets ( 1 ).
Summary  Chayote squash is high in  many nutrients — especially folate (vitamin B9) — while low in calories, carbs,  and fat.

2. Contains potent antioxidants
Many of chayote’s benefits may be attributed to its antioxidant content.
Antioxidants  are compounds found in a variety of foods that protect against cellular damage, reduce inflammation, and lower stress within your body ( 2 ).
Chayote squash provides the antioxidants quercetin, myricetin, morin, and kaempferol ( 2 ).
Of these, myricetin occurs in the highest amounts. Research suggests that myricetin carries strong anticancer, antidiabetes, and anti-inflammatory properties ( 2 ,  3 ).
Additionally, chayote squash is an excellent source of  vitamin C , which serves as an antioxidant in your body ( 4 ).
Summary  Chayote squash provides  multiple antioxidants — including vitamin C and myricetin — that fight disease  and promote health.

3. May promote heart health
Eating chayote squash may improve several heart disease risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and poor blood flow.
Animal and test-tube research indicates that chayote compounds may help relax blood vessels, thereby improving blood flow and reducing blood pressure ( 5 ).
Myricetin, a prominent antioxidant in chayote squash, has also been shown to  lower cholesterol  in some animal studies ( 3 ).
Moreover, this squash is a good source of fiber, providing about 14% of the RDI. Higher intake of fiber-rich foods like chayote is associated with a  reduced risk  of heart disease ( 1 ,  6 ).
Summary  Various plant compounds  and fiber present in chayote make it a good choice for heart health. These  compounds may improve blood flow while lowering blood pressure and cholesterol.

4. May promote blood sugar control
Chayote squash is low in total carbs and high in soluble fiber, which may help regulate blood sugar levels ( 7 ).
Soluble fiber slows down your digestion and absorption of carbs, which  reduces your blood sugar  response after eating ( 8 ).
Chayote may also improve blood sugar control by affecting insulin.
Insulin resistance  is a condition that occurs when your cells become less sensitive to insulin — a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels.
This leads to progressively higher blood sugar levels and can eventually result in diabetes.
Research suggests that unique plant compounds in chayote may play a role in increasing your sensitivity to insulin by reducing the activity of enzymes linked to poor blood sugar control and type 2 diabetes ( 9 ).
Summary  Fiber and plant compounds  in chayote may contribute to stabilizing blood sugar and improving insulin  sensitivity.

5. May support a healthy pregnancy
Folate, or vitamin B9, is essential for all people — but it’s particularly important for those who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
During early pregnancy, folate is required for proper development of the fetal brain and spinal cord. Adequate  folate  intake may also play a role in preventing preterm births ( 10 ).
Chayote is an excellent source of folate, providing over 40% of the RDI in one squash ( 1 ).
Thus, including chayote and other  folate-rich foods  as part of a balanced diet is a great way to support a healthy pregnancy.
Summary  Chayote is an excellent  source of folate, a nutrient required for proper fetal development. Therefore,  the squash may have appeal for women who are pregnant or trying to become so.

6. May have anticancer effects
Higher fruit and vegetable consumption is associated with a reduced risk of various types of  cancer , including those of the digestive tract ( 11 ).
Test-tube studies note that certain chayote compounds may slow the growth and progression of some cancer cells, such as those of cervical cancer and leukemia ( 12 ,  13 ).
Although these results are promising, current evidence isn’t strong enough to suggest that chayote has  cancer-fighting effects  in humans.
Ultimately, more research is needed.
Summary  Some test-tube research  indicates that compounds in chayote may have anticancer benefits, but more  studies are needed.

7. May slow visible signs of aging
One of the main theories of aging centers on molecules called free radicals that inflict damage on your cells, ultimately leading to reduced functionality over time ( 14 ).
Some research indicates that consuming foods high in antioxidants may slow the aging process by protecting cells from free radical damage ( 14 ).
Chayote squash happens to be full of antioxidants, one of which is vitamin C.
In addition to its antioxidant capacity, vitamin C is necessary for producing  collagen , one of the primary proteins found in your skin. Collagen is often credited with giving skin its firm, youthful appearance ( 15 ).
Thus, adequate intake of vitamin-C-rich foods like chayote squash may help  reduce visible signs of aging  ( 15 ).
What’s more, a recent test-tube study revealed a strong protective effect of chayote extract on human skin cells against damage from UV radiation ( 16 ).
Ultimately, more research is needed on chayote and skin health.
Summary  Chayote contains several  antioxidants, including vitamin C, which may contribute to youthful-looking  skin and reduce visible signs of aging.

8. May support liver function
Fatty liver disease is a condition in which excess fat is deposited into liver tissue. Too much fat in your liver can affect its ability to function properly ( 17 ).
Both test-tube and animal studies suggest that chayote squash extract may protect against fat accumulation in the liver, thus potentially preventing or treating  fatty liver disease  ( 18 ,  19 ).
In one study, rats fed a high-fat diet and treated with chayote extract had significantly lower cholesterol and fatty acid deposits in their livers than control rats. This was due to apparent changes in the function of enzymes involved in fat metabolism ( 19 ).
At this point, more research is needed to understand how chayote squash may support  liver health  in humans.
Summary  Test-tube and animal  research indicates that chayote squash extract may reduce fat accumulation in  your liver, potentially protecting against fatty liver disease. However, more  studies are needed.

9. May promote a healthy weight
Chayote squash boasts very few calories but a lot of fiber — two attributes which can support a healthy weight ( 20 ).
A whole chayote squash (203 grams) provides 39 calories and 4 grams of fiber. Fiber slows down the rate at which your stomach empties, leaving you  feeling full  and satisfied for longer — which may decrease food intake and promote weight loss ( 1 ,  21 ,  22 ).
Moreover, research suggests that consumption of dietary fiber may increase fullness hormones like GLP-1 and peptide YY ( 23 ).
Thus, adding chayote squash to your diet may help you stay on track with your  weight loss  goals.
Summary  Chayote is low in  calories and high in fiber, which can aid weight loss and maintenance by  helping you feel fuller for longer.

10. May support digestive health
Your digestive tract is responsible for a variety of essential functions, including detoxification, immunity, and digestion and absorption of nutrients ( 24 ).
Consumption of fruits and vegetables like chayote squash can  boost digestive function .
Flavonoids, plant compounds which support digestion, are found in high amounts in chayote ( 2 ).
Research indicates that flavonoid-rich foods aid digestive enzymes involved in the removal and excretion of waste products in your digestive tract ( 24 ).
What’s more, adequate intake of fiber-rich foods like chayote can encourage healthy intestinal function and maintenance of  healthy gut bacteria .
In turn, these benefits promote bowel regularity and may play a role in preventing various chronic conditions, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and colon cancer ( 25 ).
Summary  Flavonoids and fiber in  chayote boost various functions of your digestive tract, including healthy gut  bacteria and bowel regularity.

How to add it to your diet
Chayote is very versatile and relatively easy to acquire and prepare.
These squashes are bright green and pear-shaped, with lots of ridges on their skin. Their mild flavor lends itself to both sweet and savory dishes.
Although  botanically classified  as fruits, chayote squashes are prepared like vegetables. Every part of the squash can be eaten, including its skin, flesh, and  seeds . You can consume it raw or cooked.
When served raw, it makes a great addition to smoothies, slaws, and salads. Alternatively, it’s easily steamed, roasted, or fried. You could even consider adding it to soups, stews, and casseroles for an extra boost of nutrition.
Summary  Chayote squash is a  green, pear-shaped fruit often used as a vegetable. Its mild flavor makes it a  versatile addition to a variety of dishes.

The bottom line
Chayote squash is low in calories but packed with fiber, antioxidants, and essential nutrients that make it a healthy addition to almost any diet.
Its potential benefits include supporting a  healthy pregnancy  and promoting heart health.
Colorful and easy to prepare, chayote is worth trying out as part of a  balanced diet .
