“[The products] I’ve tried in the past have had too much black pepper and cause indigestion—this product was just right! The amount of curcumin in this product was potent and so helpful since it is the targeted compound within turmeric for fighting inflammation.”
— Kristin Currin-Sheehan, Healthline editor
You may love turmeric as a spice or spice blend to cook with, but if you’re looking for medicinal purposes, a turmeric supplement provides a more concentrated dose of the compound curcumin and other curcuminoids.
Turmeric and other  herbs have a long history in Ayurveda , the traditional Indian system of medicine.
We have been evaluating turmeric supplements on the market since 2020 — researching the products for ingredient safety and effectiveness — and selected these reliable picks.
Note that the dosage recommendations range from 1 to 3 capsules or tablets 1 to 5 times daily.
So a product that you need to take fewer times per day may end up being comparatively cheaper, despite having a higher price per count than a product that you need to take several times per day.
You’ll see the terms “piperine” and “BioPerine” seemingly used interchangeably.
Piperine is a plant compound found in  black pepper , which some supplements include for better absorption. BioPerine is a patented extract of piperine.
You can learn more by reading  5 emerging benefits of BioPerine and piperine supplements .
You might already know turmeric contains a class of compounds called curcuminoids, the most prevalent of which is curcumin. Curcumin  may reduce  pain from arthritis, help regulate blood sugar levels, and improve cholesterol levels, among other benefits. You’ll see both terms used throughout our roundup.

Healthline’s picks of the best turmeric supplement options

Best overall

Dose   2 capsules per day
Active ingredient(s) (serving strength)   curcumin phytosome 1 g

The body  doesn’t absorb  curcumin very well.
To boost your absorption of curcumin, Thorne uses a patented formulation of a compound called Meriva, which is standardized to contain  18% to 22%  total curcuminoids.
Meriva also contains  lecithin , a type of fat found in foods like soybeans and eggs. Compared with other extracts, Meriva has been shown to produce  29 times  better absorption of curcumin in humans.
Thorne Curcumin Phytosome Capsules contains 1,000 milligrams (mg) of Meriva per 2-capsule serving.
These supplements are manufactured in current good manufacturing practices (CGMP)-compliant facilities and undergo third-party testing. The company has also received an A1 rating from Australia’s  Therapeutic Goods Administration .

Healthline editor Kristin Currin-Sheehan tried these liquigels for 30 days t o reduce chronic inflammation that causes her waves of pain episodes due to  fibromyalgia ,  occipital neuralgia , and  hypertrophic trapezius  muscles.
For her pain management, keeping inflammation at bay is the name of the game.
“I love the taste and effects of turmeric on my inflammation; however, methods of intake like turmeric shots or ‘ Golden Milk ‘ can leave my teeth yellow. I do prefer capsules.”
Her main critique was that the pills are large, but, she says of the texture, “They go down smoothly.”
Currin-Sheehan said she “noticed a gradual reduction in inflammation in my trapezius and a muting of a recent fibromyalgia pain episode.”
She traveled out of state and adds that “usually the stress and late-night prep and packing to travel, combined with having to tow luggage triggers pain episodes. That happened this time but it was not as severe after taking daily turmeric for 10 days leading up to the business trip.”
A specific perk of Sports Research’s Turmeric and Curcumin compound? “Turmeric and  curcumin are absorbed more readily with a fat  (fat soluble), so I appreciated the added coconut oil in the supplement, so I didn’t have to worry about pairing with a particular meal.”

A comparison of the best turmeric supplement picks
Here’s a quick look at how our top picks compare:

How we chose the best turmeric supplement
Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the brands on this page, we considered all the vitamin brands that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further.
Every brand and product on our list has been  vetted  to ensure that it aligns with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being. Each product in this article:
adheres to allowable health claims and labeling requirements, per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations
is manufactured in facilities that adhere to  CGMPs  established by the FDA
is produced by a medically credible company that follows ethical, legal, and industry best standards
is made by a company that provides objective measures of trust, such as having its supplements validated by third-party labs
Additional factors we considered included:
Effectiveness:  We prioritized turmeric supplements that are formulated for better absorption.
Ingredients:  We looked for supplements that are free of unnecessary ingredients like fillers and artificial sweeteners and colors.
Dietitian recommended:  All the products listed below were handpicked by a registered dietitian.
Price:  We included products to suit a range of budgets.

What to look for in a turmeric supplement
When shopping for a turmeric supplement, it’s important to consider:
The FDA doesn’t regulate supplements in the same way as pharmaceuticals, so it’s important to choose a supplement made by a reputable company.
Look for products that are manufactured in CGMP-compliant facilities and tested for purity and potency, ideally by a third-party organization such as  NSF International ,  U.S. Pharmacopeia , and  Underwriters Laboratories .
Third-party testing goes beyond the basic requirements set forth by the FDA and helps increase product transparency to consumers, ensuring that the supplement contains what it claims to on the label.
The optimal dose of turmeric varies depending on the condition you wish to treat, so it’s important to talk with a healthcare professional to discuss an appropriate dose for you. In general, a turmeric supplement may contain 500 mg to 1,000 mg per serving.
Many supplement companies use patented ingredients intended to  improve  turmeric absorption.
For example, piperine, an alkaloid component of black pepper, is often included as an active ingredient in the form of BioPerine to  help enhance  the body’s ability to absorb turmeric.
Fat  can also help  with absorption, which is why you may see products that contain extra virgin olive oil or  coconut oil .
There are many different turmeric supplement forms to choose from, including capsules, tablets, gummies, and liquids.
Some people may prefer the ease and convenience of capsules and tablets. Meanwhile, gummies or liquids might be a better option if you have difficulty swallowing medications.
Be sure to consider which form you prefer when looking for the best turmeric supplement to fit your needs.

Who shouldn’t use turmeric?
While turmeric is considered  generally safe  for healthy adults, some people should limit or avoid supplemental doses of turmeric.
It’s especially important to consult a healthcare professional before adding a turmeric supplement to  avoid  potential drug-herb interactions if you have a  bleeding disorder  or take blood thinners (anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs).
This is because turmeric has an antiplatelet effect and can slow blood clot formation. This can potentially increase the risk of bleeding by increasing the effects of blood-thinning drugs.
Additionally, some side effects have reported with higher doses of turmeric, such as  over 8 grams (g) . Some people may experience nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, and  skin rashes . Turmeric supplements are not recommended during pregnancy.
It’s best to clear any new supplements with a healthcare professional before taking them, this is especially true if you are taking any medications. As well, if you choose to take a turmeric supplement, keep it at a dosage of under 2 g per day, which is the typical amount found in studies.
Some effects of additional types of prescription drugs can be  altered  if you take curcumin, including:
cardiovascular medications (like warfarin)
antibiotics
antidepressant agents (like sertraline)
chemotherapeutic drugs
antihistamines
diabetic medications
antacids

Frequently asked questions about turmeric supplements
While it’s likely safe for most people to take turmeric pills every day, there isn’t enough research to confirm the safety of long-term supplementation.
There’s no conclusive evidence on daily supplement use. But the the joint  FAO/World Health Organization Committee  has stated that curcuminoid doses of 0 mg to 3 mg per kilogram (0 mg to 1.3 mg per pound) of body weight per day are acceptable.

Every body is different and may respond differently to supplementation. However, studies from  2020  and  2021  have shown beneficial effects after at least several weeks of regular use.
Still, more research is needed, as current evidence is limited and inconclusive.

Thorne Curcumin Phytosome Capsules is our pick as the best overall because it contains a formulation of turmeric that has been suggested to be significantly more effective than other forms.
It’s also third-party tested and manufactured by a company known for producing high quality supplements.
However, BioSchwartz Turmeric Curcumin Capsules is one of the best rated because it’s relatively affordable, is formulated with piperine for enhanced bioavailability, and can be divided into two or three doses throughout the day for optimal absorption.
Furthermore, the product is third-party tested and manufactured in a CGMP-compliant facility.

Several studies show that curcumin can significantly reduce inflammation and may be beneficial for many inflammatory conditions, including:
psoriasis
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
arthritis
It’s also naturally derived and  associated  with few adverse effects,  compared with  over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs.
However, turmeric supplements shouldn’t be used in place of prescription medications or other treatments for medical conditions. It’s also important to talk with a doctor before adding turmeric supplements to your routine, especially if you’re taking other medications or have any underlying health conditions.

Pairing turmeric with black pepper can significantly  boost  the absorption of curcumin, which is why both ingredients are often included in many turmeric supplements.
However, turmeric can also be beneficial on its own, and black pepper isn’t the only ingredient that can increase its absorption. In fact, because it’s fat-soluble, combining curcumin with high fat ingredients like olive oil or coconut oil can also be a good option to  optimize  absorption.

The short answer is that generally speaking, a turmeric supplement  with  curcumin, or curcumin on its own are the most studied to fight inflammation. (i.e., Not as much research on turmeric by itself being most effective for inflammation.)
Curcumin is the inflammation-fighting compound  within  turmeric the spice, but both work effectively against inflammation.
