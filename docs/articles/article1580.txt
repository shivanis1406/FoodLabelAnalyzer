Title: Is Cellulose Fiber Safe to Eat?

Cellulose is a fiber found in fruits, vegetables, and other plant foods as part of a plant’s cell walls. It’s found in tree bark and a plant’s leaves.
When you eat plant foods, you are consuming cellulose. But you may not be aware that cellulose fiber is also removed from plants to be used as an additive in many other foods as well as sold as supplements ( 1 ).
This article provides an overview of cellulose, where it’s commonly found, and whether or not it’s safe to consume.

What is cellulose?
Cellulose is made up of a series of sugar molecules linked together in a long chain. Since it is a fiber that makes up plant cell walls, it’s found in all plant foods.
When you eat food that contains it, cellulose stays intact as it passes through your small intestine. Humans do not have the enzymes needed to break down cellulose ( 1 ).
Cellulose is also an  insoluble fiber  and does not dissolve in water. When consumed, insoluble fibers can help push food through the digestive system and support regular bowel movements ( 2 ).
In addition to their role in healthy digestion, dietary fibers like cellulose may promote health in other ways. Studies suggest that high dietary fiber intake may reduce the risk of several diseases, including gastric cancer and  heart disease  ( 3 ).
Cellulose is an indigestible, insoluble fiber found in fruits, veggies, and other plants.

Sources of cellulose
Fruits, vegetables, legumes,  whole grains , nuts, seeds, and other plant foods contain varying amounts of cellulose. The skin of plant foods usually has more cellulose than the flesh.
Celery, in particular, is very high in cellulose. If you have ever gotten stringy pieces from celery stuck between your teeth, then you have felt cellulose in action ( 4 ).
Cellulose is also a common  food additive . When used in this way, it is either taken from wood or waste from the production of plant foods, such as oat hulls or peanut and almond skins ( 1 ).
Other names for cellulose added to foods include:
cellulose gum
microcrystalline cellulose
sodium carboxymethyl cellulose
microcrystalline cellulose
Cellulose may be added to shredded cheese or dried spice blends to prevent clumps. It’s also found in some ice creams and frozen yogurts, particularly low fat varieties, to help thicken or mix the product and provide thickness in the absence of fat ( 1 ).
Bread products may be enriched with cellulose to boost their fiber content. In addition, cellulose can provide bulk to diet or low calorie foods, such as meal replacement shakes, to make them filling without increasing the total calories ( 1 ).
It’s worth noting that dietary fibers in general are added to many food products, even things like yogurts and ground meats. If you’re interested in whether the products you buy contain cellulose or another added fiber, check the ingredients list.
Finally, cellulose is available in supplement form. Cellulose supplements often contain a modified version of cellulose that forms a gel in the digestive tract.
Makers of these supplements claim that they help fill you up, lower calorie intake, and promote weight loss ( 2 ,  5 ).
However, it’s unclear whether cellulose supplements live up to their claims.
A manufacturer-funded study on the weight loss effects of the cellulose supplement  Plenity  found that people who took the supplement lost more weight than those who took a placebo after 24 weeks. Still, more long-term studies are needed ( 5 ).
Cellulose is found in all plant foods and in supplement form. It’s a common food additive and shows up in ice creams, shredded cheese, and diet foods, among many others.

Safety of cellulose
Eating cellulose — especially from whole fruits and vegetables, grains,  beans , and other plant foods — is generally considered safe.
Any potential downsides of cellulose are related to side effects from the  overconsumption of fiber . If you eat too much cellulose or fiber in general or take cellulose supplements, you may experience:
bloating
stomach upset
gas
constipation
diarrhea
Current nutrition guidelines recommend that adults get at least 25 grams of fiber from foods per day but may need more or less depending on age, gender, and personal needs ( 6 ).
If you eat a  fiber-rich diet  or are increasing your fiber intake, be sure to drink plenty of water to prevent uncomfortable side effects. Exercise can also help.
Those who need to follow a low fiber diet should limit cellulose intake. Individuals who have a health condition that affects the digestive system, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), also need to watch out for cellulose in foods.
Cellulose as a food additive is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The levels of cellulose currently used in foods are not considered to be dangerous to humans ( 7 ).
Keep in mind, however, that getting fiber from whole plant foods is usually better than getting it from additives or supplements. These foods provide many other beneficial nutrients and compounds in addition to fiber.
Before adding cellulose supplements to your diet, it’s best to speak with a healthcare professional.
Consuming cellulose from foods, supplements, or additives is likely safe for most people. However, getting too much of it may lead to side effects that happen with the overconsumption of fiber, such as gas, bloating, and stomach pain.

The bottom line
Cellulose is a type of fiber that makes up the cell walls of plants. When you consume plant foods, you are eating cellulose.
Many other foods, ranging from shredded  cheese  to low calorie or diet foods, have added cellulose to help with different properties. Cellulose also exists in supplement form.
It’s generally safe to consume cellulose. But if you eat too much cellulose or fiber, you may have uncomfortable side effects like gas and  bloating .
Try this today:  Get more fiber from foods instead of additives or supplements. Swap out juice for whole fruit, snack on nuts or seeds, try a new whole grain, or add a serving of vegetables to your dinner. Remember to drink plenty of water to help fiber cycle through your body.
