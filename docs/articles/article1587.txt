Title: 7 Healthy Foods That Are High in Hyaluronic Acid

Hyaluronic acid is a compound found throughout your body. It plays a key role in many aspects of health, particularly in relation to your skin, eyes, and joints ( 1 ).
For example, studies show that it could reduce the appearance of wrinkles and improve skin hydration, texture, and elasticity ( 2 ,  3 ).
It may also support wound healing and the treatment of dry eyes, acid reflux, and osteoarthritis ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
Your body can produce hyaluronic acid, but the compound is also available in oral supplements, injections, and topical products such as serums.
In addition, you can get it from certain foods. Plus, some foods provide nutrients your body uses to boost hyaluronic acid production.
Here are 7 healthy foods that are high in hyaluronic acid or its building blocks.

1. Bone broth
Bone broth is made by simmering the bones and connective tissue of animals in liquid for 12–48 hours.
This results in a flavorful product that’s rich in many nutrients, including hyaluronic acid.
Bone broth also contains a good amount of protein, with approximately 10 grams in each 1-cup (240-mL) serving ( 8 ).
Additionally, it’s a good source of the compounds proline, glutamine, chondroitin, and glucosamine.
Proline and glutamine are two types of amino acids — the building blocks of protein. They promote protein production in your body. Chondroitin and glucosamine support joint health ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ).
Plus, it’s rich in collagen, a type of protein that has been shown to improve skin elasticity and hydration ( 12 ).
Bone broth contains hyaluronic acid and is high in protein and other health-promoting compounds such as proline, glutamine, chondroitin, glucosamine, and collagen.

2. Oranges
Oranges don’t contain hyaluronic acid, but they do contain naringenin.
Naringenin is a  flavonoid , a type of plant compound with potent antioxidant properties. It’s also found naturally in other citrus fruits, tomatoes, and figs ( 13 ).
Naringenin blocks the activity of hyaluronidase, an enzyme responsible for the breakdown of hyaluronic acid. Therefore, eating more oranges could help you maintain healthy levels of hyaluronic acid in your body ( 14 ,  15 ).
Oranges are also low in calories and brimming with vitamin C, an essential micronutrient that doubles as a powerful antioxidant ( 16 ,  17 ).
Vitamin C promotes the synthesis of collagen, the most abundant protein in your body, which is essential for the structure of your skin, muscles, hair, joints, and more. This vitamin also helps protect your skin from ultraviolet (UV) damage ( 18 ).
Oranges are rich in vitamin C, which supports skin health by promoting collagen production and protecting skin from UV rays. They also contain naringenin, a plant compound that blocks the activity of an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid.

3. Tofu
While tofu doesn’t contain hyaluronic acid, it’s high in phytoestrogens — substances that mimic the effects of the hormone estrogen ( 19 ).
Estrogen has been shown to increase levels of hyaluronic acid in the body to support skin health and prevent issues such as dryness and wrinkles ( 20 ).
Phytoestrogens  from tofu and other soy products are believed to have similar effects. In fact, studies show that they may boost hyaluronic acid production, increase collagen levels, and protect against oxidative stress, which could help slow signs of aging ( 21 ).
Tofu also provides a good amount of protein in each serving, along with several other key nutrients such as manganese, calcium, and selenium ( 22 ).
Tofu contains phytoestrogens, which may increase your body’s production of hyaluronic acid. It’s also high in protein, manganese, calcium, and selenium.

4. Kale
Kale is a leafy green vegetable that packs a powerful nutritional punch.
Each serving of cooked kale supplies a hearty dose of fiber, vitamins A and K, calcium, copper, and manganese ( 23 ).
It’s also high in magnesium, an essential mineral that is involved in more than 300 enzymatic reactions in your body ( 24 ).
Not only is  magnesium  needed for energy production, muscle function, and bone health, but it’s also involved in hyaluronic acid production ( 25 ,  26 ).
Unfortunately, about half the U.S. population consumes less than the recommended amount of magnesium each day. Besides impairing hyaluronic acid production, this could negatively affect heart, bone, and mental health and may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes ( 27 ).
Kale is high in fiber, vitamin A, vitamin K, calcium, copper, and manganese. Additionally, it’s rich in magnesium, a mineral that’s needed for hyaluronic acid production.

5. Almonds
Almonds are tree nuts popular for their rich flavor and versatility.
They’re also highly nutritious, with lots of protein, fiber, and heart-healthy fats in each serving ( 28 ).
Plus, they’re loaded with magnesium, which supports skin health by increasing your body’s production of hyaluronic acid ( 26 ,  28 ).
What’s more, almonds are a great source of vitamin E, a micronutrient that helps neutralize harmful free radicals and combat  oxidative stress . This can help speed up wound healing and protect against skin damage ( 29 ).
Almonds are rich in fiber, protein, heart-healthy fats, and vitamin E. They’re also a good source of magnesium, a mineral that’s involved in your body’s production of hyaluronic acid.

6. Edamame
Edamame is a type of immature soybean. It’s often boiled or steamed and served with a sprinkle of salt.
Like tofu and other soy products, edamame contains phytoestrogens, which can increase your body’s levels of hyaluronic acid ( 21 ).
Edamame also provides manganese, which is needed to activate prolidase, an enzyme involved in  collagen metabolism  ( 30 ,  31 ,  32 ).
Additionally, edamame is an excellent source of protein and can help you meet your needs for other important vitamins and minerals, including folate, vitamins C and K, and iron ( 30 ).
Edamame contains phytoestrogens that may increase your body’s production of hyaluronic acid. It’s also a good source of protein, manganese, folate, vitamins C and K, and iron.

7. Sweet potatoes
It’s no secret that sweet potatoes are incredibly nutritious — rich in fiber, vitamins A and C, and manganese ( 33 ).
They also provide plenty of magnesium in each serving, which enables your body to produce hyaluronic acid efficiently ( 26 ,  33 ).
Sweet potatoes also contain a wide array of  antioxidants  that help prevent oxidative cell damage and chronic disease ( 34 ,  35 ).
Furthermore, sweet potatoes are brimming with beta carotene, a compound that has been shown to relieve inflammation, neutralize harmful free radicals, and protect against skin damage and sunburns ( 36 ).
Sweet potatoes are high in magnesium, which is needed for the production of hyaluronic acid. They also contain many vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, as well as beta carotene.

The bottom line
Hyaluronic acid is a compound that your body produces and that is also found in many foods and supplements.
It may benefit skin health, inflammation, and conditions such as acid reflux, dry eyes, and osteoarthritis.
Adding bone broth to your diet is a great way to increase your intake of hyaluronic acid. Plus, foods such as soy products, oranges, almonds, kale, and sweet potatoes provide nutrients that may naturally ramp up your body’s synthesis of hyaluronic acid.
