Title: How Long Does Wine Last?

Though unopened wine has a longer shelf life than opened wine, it can go bad. Unopened wine can be consumed past its printed expiration date if it smells and tastes OK.
If you’ve ever wondered whether a leftover or old bottle of wine is still OK to drink, you’re not alone.
While some things get better with age, that doesn’t necessarily apply to an opened bottle of wine.
Food and beverages do not last forever, and this holds true for wine as well.
This article covers how long wine lasts, as well as how to tell if your wine has gone bad.

How long does unopened wine last?
It’s important to remember that the shelf life of unopened wine depends on the  type of wine , as well as how well it’s stored.
Here is a list of common types of wine and how long they will last unopened:
White wine:  1–2 years past the printed expiration date
Red wine:  2–3 years past the printed expiration date
Cooking wine:  3–5 years past the printed expiration date
Fine wine:  10–20 years, stored properly in a wine cellar
Generally, wine should be kept in cool, dark places with bottles placed on their sides to prevent the cork from drying out.
The shelf life of unopened wine can last 1–20 years depending on the type of wine.

How long does opened wine last, and why does it go bad?
The shelf life of an opened bottle of wine varies depending on the type. In general, lighter wines go bad a lot faster than darker varieties.
Once wine is opened, it’s exposed to more oxygen, heat, light,  yeast , and bacteria, all of which can cause chemical reactions that alter the quality of the wine ( 1 ,  2 ).
Storing wine in lower temperatures will help slow down these chemical reactions and keep opened wine fresher longer.
Here is a list of common wines and an estimation of  how long they will last  once they are opened:
Sparkling:  1–2 days
Light white and rosé:  4–5 days
Rich white:  3–5 days
Red wine:  3–6 days
Dessert wine:  3–7 days
Port:  1–3 weeks
The best way to store opened wine is tightly sealed in the refrigerator.
Bottles of still, or non-sparkling, wine should always be decanted prior to storing.
Opened wine goes bad due to a series of chemical reactions that can change the flavor of the wine. In general, lighter wines go bad faster than darker wines. To prolong the shelf life, opened wine should be tightly sealed and stored in the refrigerator.

Signs your wine has gone bad
Besides looking at the printed expiration date, there are signs that your wine — both opened and unopened — has gone bad.
The first way to check is to look for any change of color.
For the most part, dark-colored wines, such as purple and  red , that turn a brownish color, as well as light white wines that change to a golden or opaque color, should be discarded.
The change in color typically means that the wine has been exposed to too much oxygen.
Unplanned  fermentation  can also occur, creating unwanted tiny bubbles in the wine.
Smelling your wine is also a good indicator of whether your wine has gone bad.
A wine that has been left open for too long will have a sharp, vinegar-like smell similar to that of sauerkraut.
Wine that has gone stale will start to have a nut-like odor or smell like applesauce or burnt marshmallows.
One the other hand, wine that has never been opened but has gone bad will smell like  garlic , cabbage, or burnt rubber.
If you are feeling adventurous, tasting your wine is also a good way to tell whether it has gone bad. Tasting a small amount of bad wine will not cause any harm.
Wine that has gone bad will have a sharp sour or burnt applesauce flavor.
Looking at the wine cork can also give you an idea.
A wine leak that is visible in the cork or a cork pushing past the wine bottle rim could be a sign that your wine has undergone heat damage, which can cause the wine to smell and taste duller.
There are a number of ways to check whether your opened and unopened wine has gone bad. Wine that has experienced changes in color, emits a sour, vinegar-like smell, or has a sharp, sour flavor has gone bad.

Health concerns about drinking bad wine
While tasting a small amount of bad wine will not cause you any harm, that doesn’t necessarily mean that you should drink it.
Wine can turn bad not only from over exposure to oxygen but also an increase in yeast and bacterial growth.
Chances are drinking bad wine may only be very unpleasant, as wine has a low risk of harboring microbial growth. As such, harmful foodborne pathogens like  E. coli  and  B. cereus  ⁠— two types of bacteria that can cause food poisoning ⁠— are not often a problem ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
That said, bacterial growth is still possible. A study looking at the survival rates of foodborne pathogens in alcoholic beverages found that they can last from several days to weeks ( 6 ).
That said, this study only looked at beer and refined rice wine.
Symptoms of food poisoning  include upset stomach, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever ( 7 ).
Therefore, if you come across bad wine, regardless of whether it has been opened, the best practice is to discard it.
Drinking bad wine is not only unpleasant but may also expose you to harmful foodborne pathogens, though the risk is relatively low. It’s best to throw out bad wine, regardless of whether it has been opened.

The bottom line
Similarly to any other food or beverage, wine has a shelf life.
The best way to enjoy your wine fresh is to  drink it  shortly after you purchase it.
However, you can still enjoy unopened wine about 1–5 years after the expiration date, while leftover wine can be enjoyed 1–5 days after it has been opened, depending on the type of wine.
You can also increase your wine’s freshness by storing it properly.
The next time you find leftover or old wine in your kitchen, check whether it has gone bad before you throw it out or drink it.
