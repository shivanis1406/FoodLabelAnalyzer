Title: Avocado Toast Is Trendy. Is It as Healthy as Everyone Says?

Avocado toast is ubiquitous on breakfast menus these days. From small cafes and upscale restaurants to fast-food chains, you’re almost guaranteed to find some form of this meal on the menu.
Whether you order it while dining out or make your own, avocado toast is the perfect canvas for a variety of sweet and savory toppings.
But some people question if eating avocado (a high fat food that is also calorie dense) or eating toast (a carbohydrate-rich food) can be part of a health-promoting, well-rounded dietary pattern.
This article explores the nutritional value and possible health benefits of avocado toast, and it offers guidance on how to make your own for optimal nutrition.

What is avocado toast?
Avocado toast, in its simplest form, is bread toasted and topped with either mashed or sliced avocado. But many people will add toppings like eggs,  fruits , vegetables, seasonings, and more.
It’s become a popular breakfast and brunch item, enjoyed both at home and at restaurants.
As public nutrition messaging has begun to embrace dietary fat in recent years — especially fat derived from plant-based sources like  avocado  — avocado toast has become a favorite among health and fitness enthusiasts.

Avocado toast nutrition
The calories and other nutrition facts will vary depending on how you make your avocado toast.
Nutrition facts for avocado toast made on a 1-ounce slice of  whole wheat  bread with half of a medium avocado (50 grams) are ( 1 ,  2 ):
Calories:  195
Fat:  11 grams
Saturated fat:  1.5 grams
Sodium:  150 mg
Carbs:  20 grams
Fiber:  8 grams
Sugar:  1 gram
Protein:  5 grams
Potassium:  425 mg
If you order avocado toast at a restaurant, make it with different bread, use more or less avocado, or add toppings, the actual nutritional composition will vary.
For example, the nutrition facts for one piece of avocado and roasted tomato toast from popular coffee chain Dunkin’ are ( 3 ):
Calories:  260
Fat:  10 grams
Saturated fat:  1.5 grams
Sodium:  630 mg
Carbs:  37 grams
Fiber:  7 grams
Sugar:  4 grams
Protein:  7 grams
Potassium:  626 mg
Avocado toast at Dunkin’ is made with avocado mixed with lemon juice,  sea salt , and pepper, and it’s served on sourdough toast with roasted tomatoes.
Adding to or adapting the recipe will change the nutrient value of your toast. For example, toppings like eggs, smoked salmon, and hemp seeds would boost the protein and healthy fat content.
Fruits and vegetables can add fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants to make your avocado toast an even more nutritious breakfast or snack.

Is avocado toast good for weight loss?
Avocado toast can be part of a weight loss plan.
Eating avocados has been linked with lower body weight, lower  body mass index (BMI) , and a smaller waist circumference ( 4,   5 ).
Some small studies have shown that consuming an avocado every day may lead to weight loss. It’s important to note, though, that much of the research in this area is funded by the Hass Avocado Board, so there’s potential for bias in these reports ( 6 ,  7 ).
Remember that weight loss isn’t caused or stymied by specific foods, but replacing certain foods with others — like using avocado on your toast instead of  pork bacon , which is high in saturated fat, for example — may help support that goal.
Avocados are a good source of monounsaturated fats and fiber, two nutrients that have been noted for their roles in aiding weight loss ( 8 ,  9 ).
In addition, diets high in monounsaturated fat, such as  the Mediterranean diet , are linked to lower body weight ( 10 ).
A review of several studies suggests that fat, especially poly- and monounsaturated fats, can increase feelings of fullness as well as reduce the release of hunger hormones in the body, which may contribute to weight loss ( 11 ).
If weight loss is your goal, you may want to choose whole grain bread and consider adding a protein source like an egg to your toast. It’ll help keep you full.

Health benefits of avocado toast
In addition to being delicious, avocado toast offers many health benefits.
A half-cup of avocado provides 11 grams of monounsaturated fats. This type of fat has been linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and lower levels of  inflammation  ( 12 ,  13 ,  14 ).
Monounsaturated fats may also improve blood sugar management and other health outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes ( 15 ,  16 ).
People often think of avocado only as a good source of fat, but a 1/2 cup of the fruit also provides 8 grams of fiber, which is about 30% of the Reference Daily Intake ( 1 ).
When paired with whole grain bread, the fiber count increases even more.
Fiber slows digestion, helping you feel full longer. It’s also linked to numerous positive health outcomes, as it plays an important role in  gut health  and can promote healthy digestion [ 17 ,  18 ].
Avocado is an excellent source of B vitamins, folate, vitamin K, and  vitamin E . It’s also a good source of magnesium, potassium, and vitamin C ( 1 ).
It contains a variety of phytonutrients, including tocopherols, carotenoids, phenolics, and phytosterols. These antioxidants are linked to heart health, eye health, and skin health ( 19 ).
Whole grain bread also contains B vitamins and may contain minerals like zinc,  iron , and magnesium ( 2 ).

Potential downsides of avocado toast
While avocado toast offers many potential health benefits, it may not be the best choice for everyone.
First, avocado toast lacks a significant source of protein, which is an important part of a balanced meal. But that’s easily rectified by topping it with an egg, smoked  salmon , tempeh “bacon,” or beans.
In addition, some avocado toasts can easily go from nutritious to more indulgent with toppings like pork bacon or a lot of cheese, which would add saturated fat. Excess saturated fat is linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease ( 20 ).
It’s also important to consider the type of bread you use and how much of it you eat per serving. White bread, which is a type of refined  carbohydrate , is linked to increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease when eaten in excess ( 21 ).
Lastly, there are some concerns about the environmental impacts of eating a lot of avocados, mostly related to transporting them around the world from California and Mexico.

How to make avocado toast
A basic avocado toast is pretty simple. Just toast your bread and top it with either mashed or sliced avocado and a pinch of sea salt.
However, there are so many interesting and tasty ways to level up your avocado toast. Here are a few ideas for toppings:
egg any style  (hard boiled and sliced, scrambled, poached, or fried), sliced tomato, and everything bagel seasoning
smoked salmon with sliced cucumbers and chives or dill
sliced strawberries and a drizzle of balsamic glaze
sliced radishes and arugula with fresh ground pepper
tomato, basil, and fresh mozzarella
black beans, salsa, and shredded Monterey jack cheese
crumbled goat cheese and fresh, sliced figs
red onion, chopped  jalapeño , and corn
hemp seeds or sunflower seeds with a squeeze of lime
Don’t be afraid to get creative and mix and match toppings for a sweet or savory meal.

The bottom line
Avocado toast is a filling breakfast or snack that offers many potential health benefits. The nutritional value will vary depending on how you make it or where you order it.
Avocados provide healthy fats, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, all of which contribute to overall health and a reduced risk of chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. Avocados may also aid in weight management.
When paired with whole grain toast, you’ll eat even more fiber, vitamins, and minerals, getting even more health benefits.
Avocado toast is delicious on its own, but it can be even tastier with your favorite toppings. Top with fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds for an extra nutrition boost.
Try this today : For toast with mashed avocado, use a very ripe avocado. If your avocado is still slightly firm, you can slice it thinly or even make an  avocado rose .
