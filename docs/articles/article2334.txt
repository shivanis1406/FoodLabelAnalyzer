Health benefits of chanterelles
Besides their unique flavor and aroma, chanterelle mushrooms offer you plenty of reasons on why you should add them into your diet.
Here are a few of the top health benefits of chanterelle mushrooms.
Chanterelle mushrooms are a good source of  antioxidants , which are compounds that may reduce inflammation and protect you against chronic disease by neutralizing harmful free radicals ( 6 ,  7 ,  8 ).
In particular, test-tube studies show that chanterelle mushrooms contain several antioxidant compounds like beta-carotene, flavonoids, polyphenols, and ascorbic acid ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ).
According to some test-tube studies, certain compounds isolated from chanterelle mushrooms could help decrease markers of inflammation, such as interleukin-6 ( 12 ).
Though more research is needed, other test-tube studies also show that specific compounds extracted from chanterelle mushrooms could have cancer-fighting properties and may slow the growth of cancer cells ( 9 ,  13 ).
Chanterelle mushrooms are one of the few natural food sources of vitamin D, an essential nutrient that many people are lacking ( 14 ).
Vitamin D  is crucial for maintaining healthy bones. It helps you regulate the absorption of calcium and the mineralization of bone tissue ( 15 ).
Ensuring that you’re getting enough vitamin D from sun exposure, food sources, or supplements is important.
In fact, some studies show that a deficiency in vitamin D may be associated with a higher risk of bone fractures and osteoporosis ( 16 ,  17 ,  18 ).
Chanterelle mushrooms contain several micronutrients that are involved in maintaining immune function.
For example, they are high in copper, which is essential for immunity. According to one review, a deficiency in this important mineral could even increase the body’s susceptibility to bacterial infections ( 19 ).
They also provide a good amount of vitamin D, another micronutrient that helps keep the immune system healthy to protect against illness and infection ( 20 ,  21 ).
What’s more, one test-tube study found that certain compounds extracted from chanterelle mushrooms could help fight free radicals and improve the function of your immune cells ( 22 ).

Potential downsides
It’s important to exercise caution when foraging for mushrooms, as chanterelle mushrooms may appear similar to several other types of mushrooms, some of which can be toxic.
In particular, chanterelle mushrooms are often confused with jack-o’-lantern mushrooms, or  Omphalotus olearius,  which are  poisonous  and could cause issues like diarrhea and vomiting ( 23 ).
Furthermore, mushrooms harvested near highways or industrial sites may contain high concentrations of heavy metals, pesticides, or other harmful contaminants ( 24 ).
Some people may also be allergic to certain types of mushrooms, including chanterelle mushrooms ( 24 ).

Wipe the pan to remove the oil, add 1 pound (454 grams) of quartered chanterelle mushrooms to the pan, and cook for 4-5 minutes. Be sure to wash them thoroughly and remove the rough ends before cooking.
Add 1 tablespoon (14 grams) of butter and cook for 2-3 more minutes.
Finally, mix in the cooked garlic and shallots, sprinkle on a bit of salt and pepper, and enjoy.
