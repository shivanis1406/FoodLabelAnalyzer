Avocados can be a nutritious part of any meal. You can use them as an ingredient in smoothies or scrambled eggs or as a substitute for other foods like mayo or sour cream.
Avocados can be added to many recipes to give your meals a nutritional boost.
Just 1 ounce (28 grams) provides good amounts of healthy fats, fiber, and protein.
Avocados may also aid heart health, weight control, and healthy aging.
Here are 23 interesting ways to add avocados to your diet.

Enjoying avocados by themselves
The simplest way to enjoy avocados is by sprinkling them with a pinch of salt and pepper.
You can also try other seasonings like paprika, cayenne pepper, balsamic vinegar, or  lemon juice .
A quick way to season an avocado is to cut it into chunks and drizzle it with a little  olive oil , balsamic vinegar, pepper, and salt.
It’s possible to substitute regular spreads like  butter and margarine  with avocados.
Using puréed avocado as a spread on toast and sandwiches also adds extra vitamins, healthy fats, and minerals to your meal.
Avocados can also be grilled, making them a great side dish, especially for barbecued  meats .
Simply cut an avocado in half and remove the seed. Drizzle the halves with lemon juice and brush them with olive oil. Place the cut side down on the grill and cook for 2–3 minutes.
Finally, season them with salt and pepper or any other seasoning of your choice.
Avocado pickles are delicious and can be used in any dish in which you would typically use avocados, such as salads and sandwiches.
To make them, place 1 cup (240 ml) of  white vinegar , 1 cup (240 ml) of water, and 1 tablespoon of salt in a saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil.
Then, pour the mix into a jar and add three diced, unripe avocados. Finally, cover them with a lid and let them marinate for a couple of days before eating.
The pickling solution can be flavored with different ingredients like  garlic , fresh herbs, mustard seeds, peppercorns, or chilies.
Avocado fries can make a scrumptious side dish, appetizer, or substitute for regular potato fries.
They can either be  deep fried  or, better yet, baked for a healthier version.
You can enjoy your avocado fries with different  dipping sauces , such as ketchup, mustard, aioli, or ranch.

Dishes made with avocados
If you’re looking for more nutritious morning meals, try incorporating avocados into your breakfast.
One way to do this is to fill half an avocado with one egg and bake for 15–20 at 425℉ (220℃) until the egg white has fully set.
You can also top the avocado with crumbled, cooked  bacon  and season it with fresh herbs and spices like parsley, cayenne pepper, salt, and regular pepper.
Furthermore, you can replace the eggs with other ingredients, such as  tuna , chicken, vegetables, and fruits.
A simple online search will give you plenty of stuffed avocado recipes to choose from.
If you want to give a regular morning dish a twist, incorporate some avocado into your scrambled  eggs .
Simply add diced avocado to your eggs while they’re cooking in a pan. Make sure to do this when the eggs are halfway cooked to avoid burning the avocado and continue cooking them until the avocado is warm.
If you prefer cooler avocado, add it after the eggs are cooked and off the stove.
Finish the dish by topping it with some shredded  cheese  and season it with salt and pepper to taste.
Guacamole might be among the most famous Mexican dishes.
You can make it using only avocados, herbs, and seasonings, or you can add in tomatoes and onion.
Research  shows that the extra calories from  fat  and fiber in avocados may help keep you fuller for longer, which may reduce  calorie intake  at subsequent meals.
Since salads can be light in calories, adding avocados can make them a more filling meal.
Another excellent way to enjoy avocados is in soups.
Avocados can be used as the main ingredient to make avocado soup, or you can add chunks of this green fruit to other soups.
You can find many nutritious soup recipes that incorporate avocados online. These soups can often be enjoyed chilled or hot.

However, avocados are widely used in sushi rolls as well. They have a creamy mouthfeel and can be used to fill or top sushi rolls.

Switch it up by making your favorite banana bread recipe with avocado instead of bananas.
Alternatively, keep the  bananas , add cocoa powder, and replace butter or oil with avocado for a scrumptious chocolate-avocado-banana bread.
Avocados can be used to make a delicious and creamy avocado sauce for  pasta  dishes.
Vegetables that go well with this sauce include tomatoes and  corn .

2 tablespoons (30 ml) of water
2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive or avocado oil
a pinch of salt
a pinch of pepper
Avocados are a great addition to many recipes. For example, avocado slices are perfect to top sandwiches and burgers.
They’re also great for sprinkling on typical Mexican dishes like tacos and nachos.
Store-bought creamy dressings can add a ton of sugar and unhealthy vegetable oils to your salad. Making your own dressing is always recommended to keep your  salad  nutritious and low in calories.

Just blend together the following ingredients and add more water as needed to adjust the consistency:
1/2 avocado
1/2 cup (120 ml) of water
3/4 cup (12 grams) of chopped  cilantro
the juice of 1 lime
1 clove of garlic
1/4 cup (60 grams) of Greek yogurt
1/2 teaspoon of salt
1/4 teaspoon of ground black pepper
Hummus  is a nutrient-rich dish usually made with chickpeas, olive oil, and tahini.
Chickpeas are an excellent source of protein and fiber, and tahini and olive oil provide monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.
Adding avocado to this mixture can increase the  fiber  and healthy fat contents of the dish. Furthermore, the avocado contributes to the creaminess of the hummus.

Avocados in desserts and sweet dishes
Avocado ice cream can be a healthier and more nutritious option than regular ice cream.
It can be made by combining avocado, lime juice, milk, cream, and  sugar .

Plus, avocado ice pops are a delicious and refreshing way to keep you cool on hot days.
Avocado can be used as a vegan substitute for  shortening , butter, eggs, and oils in baking.
This substitution can reduce the calorie content of foods. For example, 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of avocado only have  50 calories , compared with  204 calories  for the same serving of butter.
Plus, swapping in avocado is easy, as 1 cup (230 grams) of oil or butter equals 1 cup (230 grams) of mashed avocado. Additionally, 1 egg equals 2–4 tablespoons (30–60 grams) of mashed avocado.
Avocado is often used to make chocolate cakes, brownies, mousse, and pudding, as its green color will be hidden in the  dark chocolate  color.
Pancakes are high in  carbs , but adding avocado can provide extra nutrients, vitamins, and minerals.

Additionally, you can add  fruit  like blueberries to increase the nutrient content of the pancakes.

Avocado drinks
Smoothies can be a perfect meal or snack substitute.
You can combine avocado with green, leafy vegetables like  kale  and fruits like banana, pineapple, or berries. Plus, for a protein-packed beverage, try adding  protein powder , Greek yogurt, or milk.
For a quick smoothie, blend the following:
1 ripe avocado, halved and pitted
1/2 banana
1 cup (240 ml) of milk
1/2 cup (125 grams) of vanilla Greek yogurt
1/2 cup (15 grams) of spinach
ice to taste
The options are endless when it comes to smoothies, and you can find countless recipes online or in specialized cookbooks.
Avocados can be used to make incredible cocktails like margaritas, daiquiris, or martinis.
Even though they’re all made differently, they have a similar creamy consistency.
Non-alcoholic versions of these drinks can be made by simply omitting the  alcohol .

The bottom line
Eating avocados has been shown to  benefit your health  in various ways.
They’re surprisingly easy to incorporate into recipes, contributing to both the texture, taste, and nutrient content of many meals.
