Title: 9 Teas That Can Improve Digestion

Teas like peppermint and ginger, among others, may help relieve digestive symptoms like bloating and inflammation. However, some ingredients may interact with medications you’re already taking.
People have been drinking tea to help treat digestive issues and other illnesses for thousands of years.
Several herbal teas have been shown to help with nausea, constipation, indigestion, and more. Fortunately, most of them are widely available and easy to make.
Here are 9 teas that can improve your digestion.

1. Peppermint
Peppermint, a green herb from the  Mentha piperita  plant, is well known for its refreshing flavor and ability to soothe an upset stomach.
Animal and human studies have shown that menthol, a compound in peppermint, improves digestive issues ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
Peppermint oil is sometimes used to improve  irritable bowel syndrome  (IBS), an inflammatory condition that affects the large intestine and can cause stomach pain, bloating, gas, and other unpleasant symptoms ( 5 ).
A 4-week study in 57 people with IBS found that 75% of those who took peppermint oil capsules twice per day reported improvements in symptoms, compared with 38% of those in the placebo group ( 6 ).
Peppermint tea  may provide benefits similar to those of peppermint oil, although the tea’s effects on human digestion have not been studied ( 1 ).
To make peppermint tea, soak 7–10 fresh peppermint leaves or 1 peppermint tea bag in 1 cup (250 ml) of boiled water for 10 minutes before straining and drinking it.
Summary  Peppermint may help  improve symptoms of IBS and other digestive issues, but studies on peppermint  tea’s effects on digestion are lacking.

2. Ginger
Ginger , scientifically known as  Zingiber officinale , is a flowering plant native to Asia. Its rhizome (underground part of the stem) is popularly used as a spice worldwide.
Compounds in ginger, known as gingerols and shogaols, can help stimulate stomach contractions and emptying. Thus, the spice may help with nausea, cramping, bloating, gas, or indigestion ( 7 ,  8 .  9 ).
A large review found that taking 1.5 grams of ginger daily  reduced nausea  and vomiting caused by pregnancy, chemotherapy, and motion sickness ( 9 ).
Another study in 11 patients with indigestion found that taking supplements containing 1.2 grams of ginger significantly shortened stomach emptying time by nearly 4 minutes, compared to a placebo ( 10 ).
Research comparing the effects of ginger tea and ginger supplements is limited, but the tea may provide similar benefits.
To make ginger tea, boil 2 tablespoons (28 grams) of sliced ginger root in 2 cups (500 ml) of water for 10–20 minutes before straining and drinking it. You can also steep a ginger tea bag in 1 cup (250 ml) of boiled water for a few minutes.
Summary  Ginger has been  shown to improve nausea and vomiting and may help with other digestive issues.  Ginger tea can be made from fresh ginger root or a dried tea bag.

3. Gentian root
Gentian root comes from the  Gentianaceae  family of flowering plants, which grows worldwide.
Different varieties of gentian root have been used to stimulate appetite and treat stomach ailments for centuries ( 11 ,  12 ).
The effects of gentian root are attributed to its bitter compounds, known as iridoids, which can increase the production of  digestive enzymes  and acids ( 13 ).
What’s more, one study in 38 healthy adults found that drinking water mixed with gentian root increased blood flow to the digestive system, which may help improve digestion ( 14 ).
Dried gentian root can be purchased from a natural food store or  online . To make gentian root tea, steep 1/2 teaspoon (2 grams) of dried gentian root in 1 cup (250 ml) of boiled water for 5 minutes before straining. Drink it before meals to aid digestion.
Summary  Gentian root  contains bitter compounds that may stimulate digestion when consumed before  meals.

4. Fennel
Fennel  is an herb that comes from a flowering plant scientifically known as  Foeniculum vulgare . It has a licorice-like taste and can be eaten raw or cooked.
Animal studies have shown that fennel helps prevent  stomach ulcers . This ability is likely due to the herb’s antioxidant compounds, which can fight damage associated with ulcer development ( 15 ,  16 ).
It may also help relieve constipation and promote bowel movements. However, it’s not understood exactly how and why fennel acts as a laxative ( 15 ).
One study in 86 elderly adults with constipation found that those who drank a fennel-containing tea every day for 28 days had significantly more daily bowel movements than those who received a placebo ( 17 ).
You can make fennel tea by pouring 1 cup (250 ml) of boiled water over 1 teaspoon (4 grams) of fennel seeds. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes before pouring through a sieve and drinking. You can also use freshly grated fennel root or fennel tea bags.
Summary  Fennel has been  shown to help prevent stomach ulcers in animals. It may also help promote bowel  movements and thus help improve chronic constipation.

5. Angelica root
Angelica  is a flowering plant that grows all over the world. It has an earthy, slightly celery-like taste.
While all parts of this plant have been used in traditional medicine, angelica root — in particular — may aid digestion.
Animal studies have shown that a polysaccharide in angelica root may protect against stomach damage by increasing the number of healthy cells and blood vessels in the digestive tract ( 18 ,  19 ).
For this reason, it may also help fight intestinal damage caused by oxidative stress in those with ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory condition that causes sores in the colon ( 20 ).
What’s more, one test-tube study on human intestinal cells found that angelica root stimulated the secretion of intestinal acids. Therefore, it may help  relieve constipation  ( 21 ).
These results suggest that drinking angelica root tea may promote a healthy digestive tract, but no human studies have confirmed this.
To make angelica root tea, add 1 tablespoon (14 grams) of fresh or dried angelica root to 1 cup (250 ml) of boiled water. Let it steep for 5–10 minutes before straining and drinking it.
Summary  Animal and  test-tube studies have shown that angelica root protects against intestinal  damage and stimulates the release of digestive acids.

6. Dandelion
Dandelions  are weeds from the  Taraxacum  family. They have yellow flowers and grow worldwide, including in many people’s lawns.
Animal studies have shown that dandelion extracts contain compounds that may promote digestion by stimulating muscle contractions and promoting the flow of food from the stomach to the small intestine ( 22 ,  23 ).
A study in rats found that dandelion extract also helped protect against ulcers by fighting inflammation and decreasing the production of stomach acid ( 24 ).
Hence, drinking dandelion tea may promote healthy digestion. However, research in humans is limited.
To make dandelion tea, combine 2 cups of dandelion flowers and 4 cups of water in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, then remove it from heat and let it steep for 5–10 minutes. Strain it through a colander or sieve before drinking.
Summary  Dandelion extract  has been shown to stimulate digestion and protect against ulcers in animal  studies. Human studies are needed.

7. Senna
Senna is an herb that comes from flowering  Cassia  plants.
It contains chemicals called sennosides, which break down in the colon and act on smooth muscle, promoting contractions and bowel movements ( 25 ).
Studies have shown that senna is a highly effective  laxative  in both children and adults with constipation from different causes ( 26 ,  27 ,  28 ).
One study in 60 people with cancer, 80% of whom were taking opioids that can cause constipation, found that more than 60% of those who took sennosides for 5–12 days had a bowel movement on over half of those days ( 28 ).
Thus, senna tea may be an effective and easy way to find relief from constipation. However, it’s best to only drink it on occasion so you don’t experience diarrhea.
You can make senna tea by steeping 1 teaspoon (4 grams) of dried senna leaves in 1 cup (250 ml) of boiled water for 5–10 minutes before straining. Senna tea bags are also available at most health food stores and  online .
Summary  Senna is commonly  used as a laxative, as it contains sennosides that help promote contractions of  the colon and regular bowel movements.

8. Marshmallow root
Marshmallow root comes from the flowering  Althaea officinalis  plant.
Polysaccharides from marshmallow root, such as mucilage, can help stimulate the production of mucus-producing cells that line your digestive tract ( 29 ,  30 ,  31 ).
In addition to increasing mucus production and coating your throat and stomach, marshmallow root may have antioxidant properties that help decrease levels of histamine, a compound released during inflammation. As a result, it may protect against ulcers.
In fact, one animal study found that marshmallow root extract was highly effective at preventing stomach ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) ( 32 ).
While these results on marshmallow root extract are interesting, more research is needed on the effects of marshmallow root tea.
To make marshmallow root tea, combine 1 tablespoon (14 grams) of dried marshmallow root with 1 cup (250 ml) of boiled water. Let it steep for 5–10 minutes before straining and drinking it.
Summary  Compounds in  marshmallow root may stimulate mucus production and help coat your digestive  tract, providing relief from stomach ulcers.

9. Black tea
Black tea  comes from the  Camellia sinensis  plant. It’s often brewed with other plants in varieties like English Breakfast and Earl Grey.
This tea boasts several healthy compounds. These include thearubigins, which may improve  indigestion , and theaflavins, which act as antioxidants and may protect against stomach ulcers ( 33 ,  34 ,  35 ).
One study in mice with stomach ulcers found that 3 days of treatment with black tea and theaflavins healed 78–81% of ulcers by suppressing inflammatory compounds and pathways ( 36 ).
Another study in mice found that black tea extract improved delayed gastric emptying and resulting indigestion caused by a medication ( 34 ).
Therefore, drinking black tea may help improve digestion and protect against ulcers, but more research is needed.
To make black tea, steep a black tea bag in 1 cup (250 ml) of boiled water for 5–10 minutes before drinking it. You can also use loose black tea leaves and strain the tea after steeping.
Summary  Drinking black tea  may help protect against stomach ulcers and indigestion due to compounds in the  tea that act as antioxidants.

Safety precautions
While herbal teas are generally considered safe for healthy people, you should be cautious when adding a new type of tea to your routine.
Currently, there is limited knowledge regarding the safety of some teas in children and pregnant and lactating women ( 37 ,  38 ).
What’s more, some herbs can interact with medications, and herbal teas may cause unpleasant side effects like diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting if consumed in excess ( 39 ).
If you want to try a new herbal tea to improve your digestion, start with a low dose and take note of how it makes you feel. Also, be sure to consult your doctor first if you are taking medications or have a health condition.
Summary  Although teas are  generally considered safe for most people, some teas may not be appropriate for  children, pregnant women, or those taking certain medications.

The bottom line
Herbal teas  can provide a variety of digestive benefits, including relief from constipation, ulcers, and indigestion.
Peppermint, ginger, and marshmallow root are just some of the many types of teas that may help improve digestion.
If you want to start drinking a certain tea to aid your digestion, be sure to confirm the appropriate amount to brew and how often to drink it.
