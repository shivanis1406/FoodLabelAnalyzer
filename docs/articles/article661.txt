Title: 10 Supplements That Fight Inflammation

Chronic inflammation can increase your risk of developing certain underlying conditions, including type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Research suggests the following dietary supplements can help reduce this inflammation and support overall well-being.
Inflammation is a natural short-term immune response to trauma, illness, and stress. However, long-term inflammation can be caused by lifestyle habits like inadequate sleep, smoking, and lack of physical activity.
Anti-inflammatory foods, exercise, adequate sleep, and stress management may help reverse chronic inflammation. In some cases, getting additional support from supplements may also be useful.
Here are 10 supplements that research shows may help reduce inflammation.

1. Curcumin
Curcumin is a compound found in the spice turmeric, which is commonly used in Indian cuisine and known for its bright yellow hue. It provides several impressive  health benefits .
Curcumin  may help decrease  inflammation in diabetes, heart disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer, among other conditions.
It also appears to be beneficial for reducing inflammation and improving symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
A  2015 randomized controlled trial  found that people with metabolic syndrome who took curcumin had significantly reduced levels of the inflammatory markers  C-reactive protein (CRP)  and malondialdehyde compared with those who received a placebo.
In a  2014 study , 80 people with  solid cancerous tumors  were given 150 milligrams (mg) of curcumin daily for 8 weeks. Most of their inflammatory markers decreased much more than those of the control group. Their quality of life scores also increased significantly.
While these benefits are possible, curcumin is  poorly absorbed  into your bloodstream because its bioavailability (the rate at which your body absorbs a substance) is limited.
Black pepper  — and a component of black pepper called  piperine  — can significantly boost the absorption of curcumin. For this reason, many  curcumin supplements  also contain piperine.
When cooking, you can use turmeric and black pepper together to ensure optimal absorption of the curcumin.
Up to 500 mg of curcumin per day is usually safe, but people taking higher doses in studies  have reported  symptoms including nausea, diarrhea, and headache.

2. Fish oil
Fish oil supplements  contain omega-3 fatty acids. They  may help decrease  the inflammation associated with diabetes, heart disease, and other conditions.
The two primary omega-3s in fish oil are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Your body converts them to ALA, which is an essential fatty acid.
DHA, in particular, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects that  reduce cytokine levels  and  promote gut health . It  may also decrease  the inflammation and muscle damage that occur after exercise, but more research is needed.
Some  research shows  that DHA supplementation can significantly reduce levels of inflammatory markers compared with placebo.
Fish oil dosages  containing  less than 2 grams (g) of combined EPA and DHA are usually safe, but fish oil may cause fishy burps, bad breath, heartburn, or gastrointestinal upset.
If you have a  compromised immune system  or you’re taking a blood thinner, consult with a healthcare professional before taking fish oil.

3. Ginger
Ginger root  is commonly used in cooking and has a history of use in herbal medicine. It’s also a home remedy for indigestion and nausea, including morning sickness during pregnancy.
Two components of ginger — gingerol and zingerone —  may help reduce  inflammation related to several health conditions, including type 2 diabetes. Ginger consumption may also positively impact HbA1c (blood sugar control over 3 months) over time.
One  2014 study  noted that when people with diabetes were given 1,600 mg of ginger daily for 12 weeks, their blood sugar control improved, and inflammation levels decreased significantly compared with the control group.
Another  2015 study  found that women with breast cancer who took ginger supplements had lower levels of the inflammatory markers CRP and interleukin-6 (IL-6) compared with a placebo group, especially when ginger supplementation was combined with exercise.
Up to 2 g of ginger daily is usually safe, but higher dosages  may have  a blood-thinning effect. If you’re taking a blood-thinning medication, consult a healthcare professional before supplementing with ginger beyond amounts typically used in cooking.

4. Resveratrol
Resveratrol  is an antioxidant found in grapes, blueberries, and other fruits with purple skin. It’s also found in red wine, dark chocolate, and peanuts.
It’s been widely studied for its anti-inflammatory potential in people with chronic conditions like  liver disease , ulcerative colitis (UC), and obesity, as well as in people without chronic conditions.
In  one 2015 study , researchers gave people with UC (a type of inflammatory bowel disease) 500 mg of resveratrol or a placebo daily for 6 weeks. The resveratrol group experienced improvements in quality of life, UC symptoms, and inflammation.
Additionally, a  2019 review  that examined the effects of resveratrol linked it to increased calorie burn and the potential to help lower body fat. However, due to its limited bioavailability, more research is needed.
Most resveratrol supplements contain 150–500 mg per serving and have no significant side effects. However, you should consult a healthcare professional before using resveratrol if taking a blood thinner.

5. Spirulina
Spirulina  is a type of blue-green algae with strong antioxidant effects. Studies have shown that it  helps reduce  inflammation,  promotes  healthy aging, and may strengthen the immune system.
Although most research has investigated spirulina’s effects on animals, studies in older adults have shown that it  may improve  inflammatory markers, anemia, and immune function.
Up to 8 g of spirulina per day is usually safe. Many people add it to their shakes or smoothies because it comes in powder form.
There are no known significant  side effects , but people with  autoimmune conditions  may want to avoid it because it may worsen their condition due to its potential immune-strengthening properties.

6. Vitamin D
Vitamin D  is an essential fat-soluble nutrient that plays a key role in immune health and may have powerful anti-inflammatory properties.
In  several studies , researchers have noted a link between low vitamin D levels and the presence of inflammation.
In a small, high quality  2019 study  of 44 women with low vitamin D levels and premenstrual syndrome, researchers noted that taking 50,000 International Units (IU) of vitamin D every 20 days for 4 months led to decreased inflammation compared with a control group.
Similar findings  have been noted  in people who have a vitamin D deficiency in addition to obesity.
Over the long term, adults  shouldn’t take  more than 4,000 IU per day. Fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins A, D, E, and K are stored in fat cells and can build up over time,  potentially  leading to toxicity.

7. Bromelain
Bromelain  is a powerful enzyme found in  pineapple  that gives the fruit its astringency. Bromelain is the reason pineapple leaves a burning sensation if you eat too much.
However, it also has  some potential  anti-inflammatory properties. In fact, bromelain has the same anti-inflammatory capacity as  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  but with the bonus of fewer side effects.
Little research has been done on bromelain’s anti-inflammatory properties in humans, but it does appear to be helpful in  reducing  postoperative inflammation in people undergoing wisdom tooth removal.
Most bromelain supplements contain 500 mg of bromelain per serving and have no reported side effects.

8. Green tea extract
Green tea  has long been used in traditional medicine, and it’s rich in compounds that may provide many health benefits, such as  epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) , caffeine, and chlorogenic acid.
One potential benefit is that it’s extremely anti-inflammatory.
One  small 2020 study  in overweight men noted that 500 mg of green tea extract per day for 8 weeks, paired with exercise three times per week, significantly reduced inflammation compared with exercise alone or a placebo group performing no exercise.
Researchers theorize  that many of the anti-inflammatory benefits of green tea come from the EGCG it contains. EGCG acts as an antioxidant, so it can help prevent oxidative damage to your cells caused by free radicals, leading to a decrease in inflammation.
You can buy EGCG or  green tea extract  supplements, but be aware that green tea extract supplements will contain caffeine unless labeled otherwise.

9. Garlic
Garlic , like ginger, pineapple, and fatty fish, is a common food rich in anti-inflammatory compounds.
Garlic is especially high in a compound called allicin, a potent anti-inflammatory agent that  may also help  strengthen the immune system to ward off disease-causing pathogens.
In one  high quality 2018 study , 51 adults with obesity received either 3.6 g of aged garlic extract or a placebo daily for 6 weeks. Researchers found significant improvements in the inflammatory markers  tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)  and IL-6.
They theorized that long-term aged garlic supplementation may help reduce the risk of inflammation-related chronic diseases.
Garlic supplements come in various dosages, are  usually safe , and have few side effects (except for garlic breath). Additionally, you may experience some anti-inflammatory benefits from eating just 2 g of  fresh garlic  daily, which is about  one clove .

10. Vitamin C
Vitamin C , like vitamin D, is an essential vitamin that plays a huge role in immunity and inflammation. It’s a powerful antioxidant, reducing inflammation by neutralizing free radicals that cause oxidative damage to your cells.
It  also helps  optimize the immune system in several other ways, which can help regulate inflammation — because inflammation is an immune response.
In addition, high doses are commonly given intravenously to people hospitalized with severe respiratory illnesses — like influenza, pneumonia, and  even COVID-19  — to help reduce inflammation.
In healthy people, though, doses  higher than  2,000 mg may lead to diarrhea. Other than that,  vitamin C supplements  are usually safe and relatively symptom-free.
It’s also possible to meet your vitamin C needs through diet alone — green, red, orange, and yellow fruits and vegetables are all  rich sources .

The bottom line
Long-term inflammation may increase your risk of chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and autoimmune disorders.
Many supplements — consisting of anti-inflammatory nutrients, antioxidants, or other compounds — can potentially reduce inflammation in your body.
If you want to try a supplement, it’s important to:
Buy from a reputable manufacturer, preferably with a certified Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) facility (which ensures they meet Food and Drug Administration requirements), and engage in third-party product testing.
Follow the dosage instructions on the product packaging.
Check with a healthcare professional first if you’re pregnant or nursing, if you have a medical condition, or if you take over-the-counter or prescription medication.
Ideally, it’s best to get your anti-inflammatory nutrients from whole foods, but supplements may help — especially if your diet lacks nutrients and antioxidants.
