Dose   1 capsule per day

Garden of Life is a trusted brand that stands out for offering supplements made from whole-food ingredients.
In particular, its Garden of Life Vitamin Code Raw B12 is a great option for people who prefer natural ingredients. It contains vitamin B12 derived from cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a yeast that is  naturally occurring  in some foods and is also known as  brewer’s or baker’s yeast .
In addition to vitamin B12, this product contains a probiotic and enzyme blend ,and a fruit and vegetable blend.
While the blends are made up of whole-food ingredients, they are proprietary, which means that the brand doesn’t disclose the amount of each ingredient. If you’re unsure about any of the ingredients or sensitive to any of them, this may not be the best product for you.
Additionally, because probiotics are not appropriate for everyone, it’s important to talk with a healthcare professional before taking this supplement.
Vitamin Code Raw B12 is certified vegan and gluten-free. It’s also third-party tested for purity and potency, though the name of the testing organization is not disclosed.
Sydney Samuels, Healthline director of commerce SEO, started taking these vitamins after being diagnosed with a B12 deficiency. According to Samuels, “I received a B12 injection and was told to start taking oral supplements.
“After taking these supplements for a few weeks, I started to notice my energy levels improve. I’ve now been taking them for almost 6 months and plan to continue doing so for the foreseeable future.”

Best vitamin B12 supplements compared

How we chose
Supplement type:  We included a variety of supplement forms, such as capsules, gummies, liquids, and sprays.
Dose:  To accommodate a wide range of needs, we included products that provide varying amounts of vitamin B12. Be sure to consult a healthcare professional to find out what dose is appropriate for you.
Testing:  To ensure label accuracy, we prioritized products that are tested throughout the manufacturing process, ideally by third-party labs and organizations, like NSF International. All products listed above are tested by a third party.
Vetting:  All the products on our list have been vetted to ensure they meet Healthline’s medical and business standards.

How much vitamin B12 do I need?
The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for vitamin B12  varies by age . Additionally, people who are  pregnant  or breastfeeding have greater vitamin B12 needs.
The  recommended amount of vitamin B12  for people who have received a diagnosis of B12 deficiency or have absorption difficulties may be higher than the RDA.
Additionally, there’s currently no established upper limit for vitamin B12 due to its low risk of toxicity. In fact, because the body doesn’t store excess vitamin B12, supplementation is generally considered safe, even at large doses.
Regardless, it’s best to consult a healthcare professional before starting supplementation, especially if you’re taking other medications.

Who needs to take vitamin B12?
Vitamin B12 supplements can help treat or prevent a vitamin B12 deficiency, which can be serious and  may lead  to anemia, fatigue, heart palpitations, dementia, and more.
Not everyone needs to take a vitamin B12 supplement, as  most individuals  can meet their needs through  diet alone .
However, healthcare professionals may recommend vitamin B12 supplements for certain populations, including:
people following a vegan diet
older adults
people who have had gastrointestinal surgery
people who have nutrient absorption issues
people with dietary restrictions
People taking certain long-term medications, such as metformin and proton pump inhibitors, may also benefit from a supplement, as these medications can affect absorption of vitamin B12.
However, with severe vitamin B12 deficiency or absorption issues, healthcare professionals may recommend an intramuscular injection rather than an oral supplement.
As with any supplement, it’s important to talk with a healthcare professional to determine whether a vitamin B12 supplement is necessary for you.

Types of vitamin B12
There are many different types of vitamin B12 available, including:
cyanocobalamin
methylcobalamin
adenosylcobalamin
hydroxycobalamin
While cyanocobalamin is the  most common  form found in supplements, there’s no research to suggest that one specific form is more effective or readily absorbed.
Vitamin B12 supplements are available in a wide range of doses as well, including high dose supplements with 1,000 mcg to 2,000 mcg per serving.
Research  suggests  that high dose oral supplements may be as effective as intramuscular injections at treating vitamin B12 deficiency. However, you should only use high dose supplements as directed by a healthcare professional.
In addition to capsules, vitamin B12 supplements are also available as liquid drops or a nasal spray.
Studies show that these forms have  similar rates  of absorption and are  as effective  as oral vitamin B12 supplementation. Therefore, it’s best to choose the form that works best for you based on your personal needs and preferences.

How to choose a B12 supplement
If a healthcare professional has recommended that you take a vitamin B12 supplement, there are several factors to consider when shopping:
Supplement form:  Vitamin B12 supplements are available in several forms, including capsules, sprays, gummies, liquids, lozenges, and chewable tablets. Be sure to choose a form that you can tolerate taking on a daily basis.
Cost:  The price per serving can vary widely across products, so consider how the one you choose will fit into your budget.
Quality:  It’s also best to choose a product that has been third-party tested, as this ensures that it has been tested for heavy metals, contaminants, and accuracy of the label.
Dose:  Most vitamin B12 supplements contain rather high doses. Be sure to talk with a healthcare professional to determine the right dose for you.

The bottom line
Vitamin B12 is an essential vitamin that’s found in several animal-based foods, including meats and many dairy products.
Certain populations, including older adults and people following a vegan diet, are at a higher risk of vitamin B12 deficiencies and may benefit from taking a vitamin B12 supplement.
When shopping for a B12 supplement, be sure to choose a product that’s appropriate for your dietary needs and preferences. It’s also helpful to select a product that’s third-party tested for purity and potency.
Before starting any new supplement, be sure to consult a healthcare professional to help ensure that you’re choosing an appropriate product and dose.
