Title: 6 Filling Parfaits That Won’t Spike Your Blood Sugar

Parfaits make a filling, nutritious meal or snack that you can customize to be diabetes-friendly. It’s best to make your own rather than buy it in a store. Read on for 6 blood sugar-friendly parfait recipes.
If you have pre diabetes or diabetes, certain diet and lifestyle factors are essential to managing your blood sugar.
Regular exercise, appropriate weight management, personalized meal plans, and blood sugar-friendly snacks and meals may all  support blood sugar management .
Most parfaits are made with layered yogurt, granola, and fresh or dried fruit, though they may also contain toppings such as nuts, seeds, spices, and cocoa nibs.
Research shows that  fiber  (from seeds, nuts, or oats) and  dairy protein  (from yogurt) may have favorable effects on blood sugar levels.
Still, it’s important to avoid parfaits that are high in added sugar, such as some store-bought varieties, those made with sweetened yogurt, and those made with granola that has added sugar. Thus, it’s best to make your own parfait rather than buy it in a store.
Here are 6 blood sugar-friendly parfait recipes.
Granola is a common ingredient in parfaits. However, many granolas you’ll find in stores are high in added sugar.
You can make homemade granola by baking a mixture of rolled oats, almonds, shredded coconut, and a touch of maple syrup.
If you do buy premade granola, make sure it’s low in added sugar.

1. Pumpkin spice parfait
Research  indicates that fiber-rich  pumpkin  pulp may effectively lower blood sugar levels.
The yogurt in this recipe may also lead to  reductions in HbA1c  — a marker of blood sugar control. Make sure the Greek yogurt you use in parfaits contains live and active cultures to reap the most benefits.
1 cup (280 grams) plain, low fat  Greek yogurt
1/2 cup (120 mL) 100% pumpkin puree
1 tablespoon (15 mL) sweetener, such as  stevia  or honey
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
Optional toppings: cinnamon and rolled oats
Combine yogurt, pumpkin puree, sweetener, and pumpkin pie spice in a bowl.
Scoop into a small glass or parfait bowl and, if desired, top with rolled oats and cinnamon.
For a heavier meal, you can layer the mixture with 1/4 cup (40 grams) of  rolled oats .

2. Pomegranate and chia parfait
Pomegranate has been shown to  improve insulin resistance and lower blood sugar levels . Insulin resistance occurs when your body stops responding to the hormone insulin, which helps regulate blood sugar.
When left to sit in liquid, chia seeds swell and develop a gel-like consistency that’s often referred to as  chia pudding . This parfait uses chia pudding as its base instead of yogurt.
1 cup (240 mL)  low fat milk
1 tablespoon (15 mL) sweetener, such as stevia or honey
1 teaspoon (5 mL) vanilla extract
3 tablespoons (30 grams)  chia seeds
1/2 cup (86 grams) fresh  pomegranate arils
Mix the milk, sweetener, and vanilla.
Add the chia seeds and let stand for 10–15 minutes.
Layer with pomegranate arils. Add more pomegranate or sweetener if desired.

3. Cinnamon apple parfait
This parfait combines cinnamon, apples, and granola. Granola is a whole grain oat product that may help moderate blood sugar levels after meals.
Combining grain with dairy products may  improve post-meal blood sugar levels  compared with mixing granola with nondairy alternatives.
Additionally, the cinnamic acid compound found in cinnamon has been shown to  reduce fasting blood sugar levels .
1 cup (280 grams) plain, low fat Greek yogurt
1 teaspoon ground  cinnamon
1/2 cup (60 grams) granola
1/2 cup (87 grams) sliced apples or  applesauce
Optional topping: 1 tablespoon (15 mL) honey or maple syrup
In a small bowl, combine yogurt and cinnamon.
In a Mason jar, layer half the yogurt, granola, and apple slices or applesauce. Repeat for another layer. Drizzle with honey or  maple syrup  (if using) and enjoy.

4. Coconut mango parfait
Eating fresh  mangoes  is linked to  improved blood sugar management  in people with overweight or obesity. Although this fruit contains natural sugars, it is a good source of  dietary fiber and vitamins A and C .
This recipe is  vegan-friendly , as it uses coconut yogurt instead of dairy yogurt.
1 cup (280 grams) plain coconut yogurt
1 tablespoon (10 grams) chia seeds
1/2 cup (83 grams) cubed fresh mango
Optional topping: shredded  coconut
Layer coconut yogurt, chia seeds, and mango.
Optionally, top with shredded coconut.

5. Soy yogurt and pumpkin seed parfait
Soy  is rich in  isoflavones , estrogen-like compounds that may help  lower blood sugar .
Moreover, some  research  suggests that pumpkin seeds have anti-diabetic effects and may help lower blood sugar levels.
1 cup (280 grams) plain soy yogurt
1/2 cup (60 grams) granola
1 tablespoon (8 grams)  pumpkin seeds
Optional toppings: 1 tablespoon (15 mL) honey or maple syrup
In a Mason jar, layer half the yogurt, granola, and pumpkin seeds.
Repeat for another layer and drizzle with  honey  or maple syrup (if using).

6. Berry parfait
Berries such as  strawberries ,  blackberries , and  blueberries  are excellent sources of antioxidants, fiber, and vitamins.
Research  has found that berries may lower post-meal blood sugar and improve insulin levels. They are also low in calories and carbs.
1 cup (280 grams) Greek yogurt
1/2 cup (60 grams) granola
1/2 cup (72 grams) preferred mix of fresh berries, sliced
1 tablespoon (8 grams) pumpkin seeds
Optional topping: 1 tablespoon (15 mL) honey or maple syrup
Scoop half the yogurt into a parfait bowl.
Top with half the granola,  berries , and pumpkin seeds.
Repeat for another layer.

The takeaway
Parfaits make a filling, nutritious breakfast or tasty snack. Plus, certain types may contain fiber and protein that can help manage blood sugar levels.
You can make homemade parfaits using a combination of seeds, dairy or  nondairy yogurt , fruits such as mango and berries, and other ingredients like pumpkin and cinnamon. These foods may lower blood sugar levels and help you feel full.
Be sure to choose low sugar granolas, or make your own at home, to  avoid a spike in blood sugar . Opt for yogurts with little to no added sugar as well.
