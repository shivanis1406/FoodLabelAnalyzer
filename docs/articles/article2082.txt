Title: The 7 Best L-Arginine Supplements, According to Dietitians

Your body needs arginine, which is more commonly called L-arginine when in supplement form, for many critical processes.
For example, the body needs it to produce nitric oxide — a vasodilator that widens your blood vessels, allowing for increased blood flow. It is also required to produce other amino acids like proline ( 1 ).
The body also needs arginine for immune function, cellular communication, and more ( 2 ).
Most people do not need to supplement with L-arginine. It may be necessary under specific circumstances and may be helpful for certain populations.

What is L-arginine?
Amino acids are the building blocks that combine to form proteins. They have three categories:
nonessential
essential
conditionally essential
The body can make nonessential amino acids naturally but must get essential amino acids through diet ( 3 ).
Some amino acids are considered conditionally essential, or semi-essential. These amino acids are considered essential only under specific circumstances such as during critical illness, adolescence, or pregnancy ( 3 ).
L-arginine is classified as a conditionally essential amino acid, meaning the body needs it in greater amounts in specific circumstances. For example, the body needs more L-arginine during infancy, pregnancy, and during critical illness ( 4 ).
In these situations, the body is unable to meet L-arginine demands on its own. As a result, it needs extra L-arginine through dietary intake or supplementation.
L-arginine supplements have also been shown to be helpful for those with certain medical conditions like high blood pressure and erectile dysfunction (ED) and may be beneficial for boosting athletic performance ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ).

Who shouldn’t take it
Most people do not need to supplement with L-arginine. This is because the body can meet L-arginine demands through dietary consumption of protein sources like fish and nuts, body protein breakdown, and endogenous L-arginine production by the kidneys ( 8 ).
Research suggests that L-arginine supplements are generally safe for most people, even when taken in high doses for long periods. However, some people may experience side effects like stomach pain and diarrhea when taking more than 9 grams per day ( 1 ,  9 ).
L-arginine supplements aren’t safe for everyone.
They should be avoided by people who have ( 10 ):
had a recent heart attack
kidney disease or low blood pressure (hypotension)
an inherited condition that impacts arginine metabolism, called guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency
L-arginine may also interact with medications like those used to treat high blood pressure.
Check with your healthcare professional if you have questions about taking L-arginine supplements. They can help you determine whether L-arginine supplements are safe and appropriate for your needs.

A 2022 study that included 98 people with ED found that a daily dose of 6 grams of L-arginine for 3 months significantly improved penile erectile function in those with mild-moderate ED ( 17 ).
For people interested in taking L-arginine to improve ED symptoms, it’s important to seek advice from a trusted healthcare professional first.

Comparing L-arginine supplements

How to choose the best L-arginine supplement
When shopping for L-arginine supplements, seek out products that have been third-party tested to ensure quality. Although the FDA regulates dietary supplements, this is minimal compared with the agency’s oversight of prescription medications.
Bear in mind that the rigor of third-party testing varies. The best way to ensure appropriate testing is to look for a label from a certification program like USP, Informed Choice, ConsumerLab, or NSF International.
If a company’s sole assertion of third-party testing is a claim on its website that doesn’t link to a specific certification program, you may want to choose another product.
If you can’t find a product tested by a third party, look for one manufactured at a cGMP facility to ensure that it meets FDA quality standards.
Next, you should choose a product that most closely aligns with your dietary needs, whether that’d be a gluten-free, allergen-free, organic, or GMO-free product.
Because L-arginine is primarily found in animal foods, many L-arginine supplements are  not vegetarian . If you’re vegan or vegetarian, look for supplements specifically labeled as suitable for these diets.
If ED is your primary concern, you should consult a healthcare professional for  more treatment options .
Keep in mind that L-arginine isn’t an essential nutrient, so no set dosage guidelines exist. Your healthcare professional may give you dosage guidance if you need it.
Dosing depends on what you’re intending to treat. For example, higher doses of L-arginine may be helpful for improving ED symptoms and athletic performance, while lower doses may be appropriate for treating other symptoms or medical conditions ( 5 ,  17 ).
It’s important to understand that, because L-arginine is conditionally essential and supplementation has been shown to benefit only certain populations, most people do not need to supplement with L-arginine.
If you’re interested in taking a supplement containing L-arginine to treat a specific medical condition like ED or to improve athletic performance, discuss dosing with your healthcare professional.
Even though L-arginine supplements are generally safe to take, they’re not appropriate for everyone and may interact with commonly prescribed medications.
It’s also recommended to keep dosing below 9 grams per day to avoid potential side effects, including nausea and diarrhea.

Frequently asked questions
Research suggests that L-arginine supplements are generally safe for most people, even when taken in high doses of up to 30 grams per day for long periods of time. Most supplements contain only around 1-5 grams of L-arginine, so it would be difficult to take too much.
Some people may experience side effects like stomach pain and diarrhea when taking more than 9 grams per day ( 1 ,  9 ).
Also, do not give your child L-arginine unless it’s medically necessary and was suggested by a healthcare professional. Giving a child too much L-arginine is extremely dangerous and can be fatal ( 10 ).
There are several different forms of L-arginine supplements. Talk with a trusted healthcare professional like a physician or registered dietitian to see which one is right for you.
Some research suggests that L-arginine may help improve symptoms of ED when taken in specific doses. For example, a 2022 study in 98 men with ED found that a daily dose of 6 gram of L-arginine for 3 months significantly improved penile erectile function in patients with mild-moderate ED ( 17 ).
Do not take L-arginine supplements for ED without discussing it with your doctor first. L-arginine has the potential to interact with medications, including those used to treat ED, like Viagra.

The bottom line
L-arginine is an amino acid precursor to nitric oxide, which helps boost circulation and blood flow. As such, it’s commonly used in  pre-workout  and male enhancement supplements.
Furthermore, pregnant women, infants, and critically injured or ill people may need more  arginine  than they can produce on their own.
Be sure to talk with your healthcare professional before adding supplements to your routine.
