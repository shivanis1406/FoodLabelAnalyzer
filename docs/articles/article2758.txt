Title: Why Does Coffee Make You Poop?

Coffee contains caffeine, which is a stimulant. Along with increasing energy, caffeine may trigger contractions in your colon and intestinal muscles. This can lead to an easier bowel movement.
Many people love their morning cup of joe.
Not only is this caffeine-fueled beverage a great pick-me-up, it’s also loaded with beneficial antioxidants and nutrients ( 1 ).
What’s more, some people find it can jump-start the other end of their body.
In fact, one study found that 29% of participants needed to use the bathroom within twenty minutes of drinking a cup of coffee ( 2 ).
This article helps explain why coffee can make you poop.

Caffeine Can Activate Your Colon
Coffee  is one of the best sources of caffeine on the planet.
Caffeine is a natural stimulant that helps you stay alert.
A single brewed cup provides approximately 95 mg of caffeine ( 3 ).
While caffeine is a great energy booster, it may also stimulate the urge to poop. Several studies have shown that it can activate contractions in your colon and intestinal muscles ( 4 ,  5 ).
Contractions in the colon push contents towards the rectum, which is the final section of your digestive tract.
Research has shown that caffeine makes the colon 60% more active than water and 23% more active than decaf coffee ( 6 ).
However, studies have shown that  decaf coffee  can also stimulate the urge to poop. This indicates that other compounds or factors are responsible ( 2 ,  6 ).
Summary  Coffee is a rich  source of caffeine, which can make your colon and intestinal muscles more  active. This helps your body push food quickly to  the rectum.

Decaf Can Also Make You Poop
It was initially believed that the  caffeine  in coffee makes you poop.
However, studies show that decaf can also do the trick. This means there must be other factors at work ( 6 ).
Chlorogenic acids and N-alkanoyl-5-hydroxytryptamides are both compounds of interest.
Studies have found that they can stimulate the production of stomach acid. Stomach acid helps churn food and move it quickly through the gut ( 7 ,  8 ).
Several other factors may explain why your morning cup of java can make you poop.
For example, the act of drinking can make the colon more active. This is called the gastrocolic reflex. It’s the same reflex that activates the colon after you eat a meal ( 9 ).
While coffee isn’t considered a meal, it may have a similar impact on your bowels ( 6 ).
On the other hand, coffee-induced bowel movements may simply be a coincidence.
This is because the bowels are twice as active when you first wake up, compared to while you’re asleep, so they’re primed and ready to go ( 10 ).
Your body’s internal clock, also known as the circadian rhythm, helps regulate many processes, including bowel movements ( 11 ).
That said, it’s still not clear how much of an impact these other factors have on stimulating your colon. More research in this area would help determine their significance.
Summary  Other compounds in  coffee, such as chlorogenic acids and N-alkanoyl-5-hydroxytryptamides,  may stimulate bowel activity. Additional  factors include the gastrocolic reflex and your body’s internal clock.

Coffee Can Stimulate Hormones
Coffee has also been shown to stimulate hormones that help push food through the gut.
For example, it can increase levels of the hormone gastrin. Like caffeine, gastrin makes the colon more active ( 2 ).
One study found that drinking regular or decaf coffee raised gastrin levels by 2.3 and 1.7 times respectively, compared to drinking water ( 12 ).
What’s more, coffee may raise levels of the digestive hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) ( 13 ).
Not only can this hormone increase the movement of food through the colon, but it’s also linked to the gastrocolic reflex, which makes the colon more active ( 14 ).
Summary  Coffee has been shown to raise levels of gastrin and  cholecystokinin, two hormones linked to  increased colon activity.

Milk or Cream May Promote Bowel Movements
Freshly brewed coffee is naturally free of additives and preservatives.
However, over two-thirds of Americans stir in milk, cream, sweeteners, sugar or other additives ( 15 ).
In particular, milk and cream may promote bowel movements, as they contain lactose. Close to 65% of people worldwide cannot digest lactose properly ( 16 ).
People who are  lactose intolerant  experience symptoms such as bloating, stomach cramps or diarrhea soon after consuming dairy.
This means lactose can trigger the urge to poop in people with lactose intolerance ( 17 ).
Summary  Coffee that contains  milk or cream may trigger digestive issues in people with lactose intolerance.  This may increase gut activity and stimulate the urge to poop.

Does Coffee Make Everybody Poop?
According to one leading study on this topic, 29% of participants experienced an increased urge to poop within twenty minutes of drinking coffee.
Surprisingly, 53% of all the women in the study were affected by this urge ( 2 ).
Women may be more prone to this symptom, as digestive conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are more common in women than in men ( 18 ).
While the post-coffee urge to go appears to be common, it doesn’t affect everyone.
In addition, it’s not clear if this symptom fades away in regular drinkers.
People with IBS and older adults may be more prone to it because their bowels are more sensitive to the effects of coffee.
Those who are lactose intolerant may also be affected by this symptom if they add milk, cream or other dairy products to their coffee.
Summary  Not everyone needs to  visit the bathroom after a cup of coffee, but it may be quite common. People  with digestive conditions, such as IBS, and those who are lactose intolerant  may be more prone to this experience.

The Bottom Line
Coffee contains a variety of compounds that may stimulate your bowels.
These include caffeine, chlorogenic acids and N-alkanoyl-5-hydroxytryptamides.
Adding milk or cream may further increase this effect, especially if you’re lactose intolerant.
However, it’s unclear which of these has the greatest impact.
If you struggle to go to the bathroom regularly, a cup of coffee may be the solution.
