Title: The 10 Best Types of Alcohol for People with Diabetes

If you have diabetes, drinking alcohol may be safe for you if you choose the right types of drinks and consider their effects on your blood sugar levels. Read on for 10 types of alcohol that are low in carbs.
The  2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans  define moderate alcohol intake as up to 1 drink per day for women and up to 2 drinks per day for men.
Here’s what one standard drink looks like:
12 fluid oz (fl oz), which equals 360 milliliters (mL) of regular beer (5% alcohol)
5 fl oz (150 mL) of wine (12% alcohol)
1.5 fl oz (45 mL) of 80-proof distilled spirits (40% alcohol)
Certain diabetes medications, such as  sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones , can increase your risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).  Excessive consumption of alcohol  further affects that risk.
If you’re taking medication, talk with your doctor about whether and how you can safely drink alcohol.

1–4. Beer
Generally speaking,  low carb beers  have fewer calories and carbs than  regular beers . Here are some of the most popular low carb beer options.
Miller Lite is an American-style light lager made with barley malt and corn syrup, among other ingredients.
However, it contains only  3.2 grams (g)  of carbohydrates in a standard 12-oz (360-mL) can or bottle, compared with  12 g  for the same serving in regular Miller beers.
Like Miller Lite, Coors Light is an American-style light lager. It provides  5 g  of carbs per 12-oz (360-mL) bottle.
In contrast, standard options, such as Coors Banquet, provide almost  12 g  of carbs per bottle.
Bud Light is another low carb beer that provides  fewer than 5 g  of carbs per serving.
With 4.6 g of carbs per 12-oz (360-mL) serving, it provides roughly 50% fewer carbs than a regular Budweiser, which contains  10.6 g  for the same serving size.
Busch beers are good alternatives for people with diabetes due to the low carb content of most of the brand’s products — including their beers that are not branded as low carb.
For instance, a 12-oz (360-mL) serving of regular Busch contains just  7 g  of carbs, while the same serving sizes of  Busch Ice  and  Busch Light  provide 4.2 and 3.2 g, respectively.

5–6. Wine
Here are two types of wine with low carb counts.
A  2023 review of studies  indicates that  red wine  can provide health benefits for people with diabetes, such as decreased oxidative stress, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease risk.
Research  also indicates that flavonoids, which are found in red wine, can reduce the risk of  diabetic retinopathy , a diabetes-related complication that damages blood vessels in the eyes.
Plus, it provides only  3.8 g  of carbs in a standard 5-oz (150-mL) serving.
The carb content in white wines is comparable to red wines.
For instance, a standard 5-oz (150-mL) glass of white wine provides  3.8 g  of carbs.
Among white wines, some styles of  champagne  may be a good choice. Dry and Brut varieties are low in sugar.
For example, a 5-oz (150-mL) serving of extra-dry champagne provides  1.8 to 2.5 g  of sugar. Brut champagne in the same serving size offer  fewer than 1.8 g  of sugar.

7. Distilled spirits
Distilled spirits or hard liquors contain few to no carbs. Here are some possible distilled spirit options.
These liquors contain  0 g of carbs  per 1.5-oz (45-mL) serving.
However, the carb content of your drink may vary depending on what you mix the liquor with.
Try to avoid mixing liquor with sugary juices or  sugar-containing soda . If you do drink these with alcohol, your blood sugar may spike and then dip to dangerously low levels.

8–10. Low carb cocktails
Try to opt for low sugar options if you feel like having a cocktail. Here are some low carb cocktails.
You make a martini by mixing gin or vodka with dry vermouth in a 2-to-1 ratio and then garnishing it with an olive or a twist of lemon peel.
Since it does not contain juices or other mixers, it contains  0.2 g  of total carbs in a 4-oz (120-mL) drink. This makes it a good choice, provided you drink it in moderation.
As its name implies, you make a vodka soda by combining vodka and club soda. As long as you use club soda or seltzer, your drink’s carb count will stay at  0 g .
If you’d rather have a flavored version, go for flavored sparkling water instead of flavored vodka, which may contain added syrups.
You make a Bloody Mary by mixing vodka and tomato juice with different sauces and spices, depending on the recipe, and serve it with a celery stick.
A Bloody Mary has a carb count of  7 g .
Tomato juice in a Bloody Mary provides  lycopene , a pigment that has  antioxidant and antidiabetes properties  and may protect people with diabetes from  heart disease .
If you’re making a Bloody Mary, opt for a variety of tomato juice without added salt. A high sodium intake  may lead to  high blood pressure.

Drinks to avoid
While there are some diabetes-friendly cocktails, such as the ones mentioned above, traditional cocktails are generally very high in added sugars. Therefore, try to avoid them unless you’re making them yourself.
For example,  margaritas ,  piña coladas , and  daiquiris  may pack 35 to 44 g of carbs per 7-oz (225-mL) drink.
Dessert wines, such as vermouth, port, and sherry, are also  high in carbs . As the name of these drinks implies, people typically serve them after a meal.
The same goes for cream liqueurs such as Bailey’s Irish Cream and Kahlua. These provide around  13 g  of carbs, of which 12 g are from sugar, for every 2 oz (60 g) of liqueur.

The takeaway
The best types of alcohol for people with diabetes are those with low sugar or carb content. That includes light beers, red and white wines, distilled spirits, and low carb cocktails if you avoid sugary juices or syrups.
