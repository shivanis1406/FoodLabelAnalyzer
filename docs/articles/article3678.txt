What to look for when buying a scale
When looking for a new bathroom scale, there are many factors to consider.
Of course, accuracy is one of the most important features, as it ensures you get precise measurements.
The price, appearance, ease of use, and technological capabilities of your scale are other components to consider.
Plus, some users may require additional features to accommodate special needs, such as a brighter display or larger weighing platform.
Additionally, athletes and people who are trying to lose weight may want to search for scales that track other measurements of body composition like  body mass index (BMI) , which is a measurement of body fat that’s calculated using height and weight.
Although BMI isn’t always accurate and doesn’t differentiate between lean mass and fat mass, it can help you determine a healthy weight range for your height ( 3 ).
Some scales also measure other aspects of body composition, including muscle mass,  body fat percentage , and body water. These metrics may also be useful when monitoring your progress and health.
Here are 12 of the best bathroom scales to help you reach your health goals.

A comparison of the best bathroom scales

Frequently asked questions
Bathroom scales use bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to estimate  body fat . This method involves measuring how quickly small electric currents travel through your body.
In addition to a small electrical current, BIA also uses other data such as your weight, heigh, age, and gender to calculate  body composition  measurements.
To determine if your bathroom scale is accurate, you can weigh an object with a known weight, such as a dumbbell. You can also weigh yourself, weigh yourself holding an object, and then weigh the object on its own. Check to see if the weights add up correctly.
Your bathroom scale can fluctuate for several reasons, including temperature, humidity, and dirt buildup on the scale. It can also fluctuate if you move it, shift your weight while using it, or use it on an uneven surface.
Plus,  weight fluctuation  is natural due to physical activity, time of day, and what you’ve had to eat and drink.
For the most accurate results, it’s important to weigh yourself at the same time each day rather than at random times. Depending on your schedule, it may be best to weigh yourself each morning after waking up and going to the bathroom.

The bottom line
Investing in a high quality scale can be a great way to  monitor your weight  and manage your health.
No matter what you’re looking for, a wealth of bathroom scales is available to fit nearly any need and preference.
From Bluetooth scales for tech-savvy people to talking scales or budget-friendly models, it’s possible to find a product that works for your needs.
However, scales aren’t right for everyone. If having a scale around or weighing yourself leads to anxiety or  disordered eating , stop using and speak with a doctor.
