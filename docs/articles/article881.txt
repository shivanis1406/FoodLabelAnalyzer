When someone is Biotin  deficient, biotin supplementation helps hair loss. Our tester was happy with Sports Research’s biotin pills.
“Hands down, this biotin supplement was the best I’ve ever tried. Added plus for the fact it’s vegan certified, so users who avoid gelatin can take this product! I also noticed my hair didn’t break as much in the shower or whenever I brushed my hair/ran my fingers through my hair. That made me really happy.”
— Parisa Syed, Healthline editor
While factors such as age, genetics, hormones, and medication may affect your hair, nutrition is key for hair health throughout life. In particular, vitamins B, C, and D, plus iron and zinc, play important roles in vitamins for hair growth and thickness.
Some supplements are formulated with these nutrients to support hair growth, strength, and thickness. But sometimes, a multivitamin or a nutrient-specific supplement will do.  Here are seven high quality supplements that supply the nutrients your hair needs.
$  = under $0.25 per serving
$$  = $0.25–$1.00 per serving
$$$  = $1.01–$1.50 per serving

Best hair growth vitamins

Best overall
Dose   4 capsules per day
Price   $$$$

Nutrafol  subscription hair vitamins contain numerous ingredients known to support healthy hair. For example,  saw palmetto  may help increase hair density, and  hyaluronic acid  can help boost hair moisture.  Vitamin C  contributes to the synthesis of collagen, which contains amino acids that can be used to build  keratin  — an important part of hair structure.

This growth nutraceutical is offered as a subscription service, affording customers the convenience of a steady supply of the product.

We also like that the company makes supplements for hair loss in both females and males, with nutrients appropriate for both. Additionally, it makes a formula specific for  postpartum hair loss .

Best gummy
Dose   2 gummies per day
Price   $$

If you are not a fan of swallowing tablets or capsules, a gummy vitamin could be a better option.

OLLY Heavenly Hair Gummies contain biotin and zinc, as well as several herbs that may actually work to support hair growth.

For example, the gummies include  amla extract  or Emblica Officinalis Gatertn, which, when used  topically , has been shown to be effective for improving  hair density and growth . Oral use of amla has not been found to have the same effect.

The gummies also contain  horsetail  extract and silica, which may help prevent hair thinning and shedding, though most  research  is based on compounds containing horsetail-derived silica, not silica itself. Horsetail can also interact with  certain medications , so it’s important to consult a healthcare professional before trying this supplement.

Best men’s multivitamin for hair
Dose   2 capsules per day
Price   $$$
Use code  "HEALTHLINE"  for  25% off .

Ritual’s subscription multivitamin for men contains important nutrients for hair health, such as zinc and vitamins B12 and D.

It also contains omega-3  docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) , an  omega-3 fatty acid  that may be an effective supplement in promoting hair growth, improving hair density, and reducing hair loss in men.

Ritual subscription vitamins are designed to fill nutrient gaps in the diet rather than provide 100% of the DV, making it a great option for someone eating a well-balanced diet that includes nutritious foods like fruits, vegetables, and lean protein.

“I had been experiencing mild anemia due to a bleeding ulcer prior to taking these vitamins and the B12 and folate content seemed to help bring my hemoglobin and iron levels back closer to normal range during the 90 day test period. Capsules were soft and easily digested compared to other vitamins I’ve taken.
“A wider range of nutrients would be nice though, most multivitamins provide more than the eight this one supplies. As someone with  Celiac disease , I did appreciate that these capsules were gluten free and vegan.”
Joe Capraro, Healthline writer
