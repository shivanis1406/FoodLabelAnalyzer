BOTTOM LINE: The pegan diet combines paleo and vegan principles but encourages some meat consumption. Though it’s rich in many nutrients that can promote optimal health, it may be too restrictive for many people.

What is the pegan diet?
The pegan diet combines key principles from paleo and vegan diets based on the notion that nutrient-dense, whole foods can reduce inflammation, balance blood sugar, and support optimal health.
If your first thought is that going  paleo  and vegan simultaneously sounds nearly impossible, you’re not alone.
Despite its name, the pegan diet is unique and has its own set of guidelines. In fact, it’s less restrictive than either a paleo or  vegan  diet by itself.
Major emphasis is placed on vegetables and fruit, but intake of small to moderate amounts of meat, certain fish, nuts, seeds, and some legumes is also allowed.
Heavily processed sugars, oils, and grains are discouraged — but still acceptable in very small amounts.
The pegan diet is not designed as a typical, short-term diet. Instead, it aims to be more sustainable so that you can follow it indefinitely.
The pegan diet, while based on principles from both paleo and vegan diets, follows its own rubric and is designed to be sustainable over the long term.

Foods to eat
The pegan diet focuses strongly on whole foods, or foods that have undergone little to no processing before they make it to your plate.
The primary food group for the pegan diet is vegetables and fruit — these should comprise 75% of your total intake.
Low-glycemic fruits and vegetables, such as berries and  non-starchy vegetables , should be emphasized in order to minimize your blood sugar response.
Small amounts of starchy vegetables and sugary fruits may be allowed for those who have already achieved healthy blood sugar control prior to starting the diet.
Although the pegan diet primarily emphasizes plant foods, adequate  protein intake  from animal sources is still encouraged.
Bear in mind that because 75% of the diet is made up of vegetables and fruit, less than 25% remains for animal-based proteins. As such, you’ll have a much lower meat intake than you would on a typical  paleo diet  — but still more than on any vegan diet.
The pegan diet discourages eating conventionally farmed meats or eggs. Instead, it places emphasis on grass-fed, pasture-raised sources of beef, pork, poultry, and whole eggs.
It also encourages intake of fish — specifically those that tend to have  low mercury content  like sardines and wild salmon.
On this diet, you should eat healthy fats from specific sources, such as:
Nuts:  Except peanuts
Seeds:  Except processed seed oils
Avocado and olives:  Cold-pressed olive and avocado oil may also be used
Coconut:  Unrefined  coconut oil  is permitted
Omega-3s:  Especially those from low-mercury fish or algae
Grass-fed, pasture-raised meats and whole eggs also contribute to the fat content of the pegan diet.
Although most grains and legumes are discouraged on the pegan diet due to their potential to influence blood sugar, some gluten-free  whole grains  and legumes are permitted in limited quantities.
Grain intake should not exceed more than a 1/2 cup cooked grains per meal, while legume intake should not exceed 1 cup cooked legumes per day.
Here are some grains and legumes that you may eat:
Grains:  Black rice, quinoa,  amaranth , millet, teff, oats
Legumes:  Lentils, chickpeas, black beans, pinto beans
However, you should further restrict these foods if you have diabetes or another condition that contributes to poor blood sugar control.
The pegan diet is made up of 75% fruits and vegetables. The remaining 25% is divided primarily among meats, eggs, and healthy fats, such as nuts and seeds. Some legumes and gluten-free whole grains may be allowed in limited quantities.

Foods to avoid
The pegan diet is more flexible than a paleo or vegan diet because it allows occasional intake of almost any food.
That said, several foods and food groups are strongly discouraged. Some of these foods are known to be unhealthy, while others may be considered very healthy — depending on whom you ask.
These foods are typically avoided on the pegan diet:
Dairy:  Cow’s milk, yogurt, and cheese are strongly discouraged. However, foods made from sheep or goat milk are permitted in limited quantities. Sometimes grass-fed butter is allowed, too.
Gluten:  All gluten-containing grains are strongly discouraged.
Gluten-free grains:  Even grains that don’t contain gluten are discouraged. Small amounts of gluten-free whole grains may be permitted occasionally.
Legumes:  Most legumes are discouraged due to their potential to increase blood sugar. Low-starch legumes, such as  lentils , may be permitted.
Sugar:  Any form of added sugar, refined or not, is usually avoided. It may be used occasionally — but very sparingly.
Refined oils:  Refined or highly processed oils, such as canola, soybean, sunflower, and corn oil, are almost always avoided.
Food additives:  Artificial colorings, flavorings, preservatives, and other  additives  are avoided.
Most of these foods are forbidden due to their perceived impact on blood sugar and/or inflammation in your body.
The pegan diet discourages several foods and food groups. However, it is somewhat flexible. Limited amounts of banned foods may be allowed occasionally.

Potential benefits
The pegan diet may contribute to your health in a number of ways.
The strong emphasis on fruit and vegetable intake is perhaps its best trait.
Fruits and  vegetables  are some of the most nutritionally diverse foods. They’re full of fiber, vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds known to prevent disease and reduce both oxidative stress and inflammation ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
The pegan diet also emphasizes healthy, unsaturated fats from fish, nuts, seeds, and other plants that may have a positive impact on  heart health  ( 4 ,  5 ).
Furthermore, diets that rely on whole foods and contain few ultra-processed foods are associated with an improvement in overall diet quality ( 6 ,  7 ).
Because the pegan diet emphasizes nutrient-rich fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats, it may help prevent disease, promote heart health, and reduce inflammation.

Potential downsides
Despite its positive attributes, the pegan diet also has some downsides that are worth considering.
Although the pegan diet allows for more flexibility than a vegan or paleo diet alone, many of the proposed restrictions unnecessarily limit very healthy foods, such as legumes, whole grains, and  dairy .
Proponents of the pegan diet often cite increased inflammation and elevated blood sugar as the primary reasons for the removal of these foods.
Of course, some people do have allergies to gluten and dairy that can promote inflammation. Similarly, certain people struggle to control blood sugar when consuming high-starch foods like grains or legumes ( 8 ,  9 ).
In these cases, reducing or eliminating these foods may be appropriate.
However, unless you have specific allergies or intolerances, it’s unnecessary to avoid them ( 8 ,  10 ,  11 ).
Furthermore, arbitrary elimination of large groups of foods can lead to  nutrient deficiencies  if those nutrients aren’t carefully replaced. Thus, you may need a basic understanding of nutrition to implement the pegan diet safely ( 12 ,  13 ).
Although a diet full of organic fruits, vegetables, and grass-fed, pasture-raised meats may seem great in theory, it may be inaccessible for many people.
For the diet to be successful, you need significant time to devote to  meal prep , some experience with cooking and meal planning, and access to a variety of foods that may be quite expensive.
Additionally, due to the restrictions on common processed foods, such as cooking oils, dining out may be difficult. This could potentially lead to increased social isolation or  stress .
The pegan diet unnecessarily restricts several healthy food groups. It may also be expensive and time consuming.

Sample menu
The pegan diet emphasizes vegetables but also includes sustainably raised meats, fish, nuts, and seeds. Some legumes and gluten-free grains may be used sparingly.
Here is a sample menu for one week on the diet:
Breakfast:  Vegetable omelet with a simple green salad dressed in olive oil
Lunch:  Kale  salad with chickpeas, strawberries, and avocado
Dinner:  Wild salmon patties with roasted carrots, steamed broccoli, and lemon vinaigrette
Breakfast:  Sweet potato “toast” topped with sliced avocado, pumpkin seeds, and lemon vinaigrette
Lunch:  Bento box with boiled eggs, sliced turkey, raw veggie sticks, fermented pickles, and blackberries
Dinner:  Veggie stir-fry with cashews,  onions , bell pepper, tomato, and black beans
Breakfast:  Green smoothie with apple, kale, almond butter, and hemp seeds
Lunch:  Leftover veggie stir-fry
Dinner:  Grilled shrimp and veggie kabobs with black rice pilaf
Breakfast:  Coconut and chia seed pudding with walnuts and fresh blueberries
Lunch:  Mixed green salad with avocado, cucumber, grilled chicken, and cider vinaigrette

Dinner:  Roast pork loin with steamed veggies, greens, and quinoa
Breakfast:  Veggie omelet with a simple green salad
Lunch:  Thai-style salad rolls with cashew cream sauce and orange slices
Dinner:  Leftover pork loin and veggies
The pegan diet emphasizes a vegetable-heavy diet that also includes protein, healthy fats, and some fruit. Grains and legumes are included, but less frequently.

The bottom line
The pegan diet is based on paleo and vegan principles — though it encourages some meat consumption.
It emphasizes  whole foods , especially vegetables, while largely prohibiting  gluten , dairy, most grains, and legumes.
It’s rich in many nutrients that can promote optimal health but may be too restrictive for many people.
You can give this diet a try to see how your body responds. If you’re already paleo or vegan and are interested in modifying your diet, the pegan diet may be easier to adjust to.
