Title: How Long Do Apples Last?

A crispy and juicy apple can be a delightful snack.
Still, like other fruits and vegetables, apples only stay fresh for so long before they start to go bad.
In fact, apples that are far past their expiration date can eventually become unsafe to eat, making it important to know how to tell when they’re no longer fresh.
This article examines how long apples typically last, which factors influence their shelf life, and what you can do to keep apples fresh for as long as possible.

How long do apples last?
How long an apple lasts depends largely on when it was harvested, how it has been stored since that time, and whether it has been washed, cut, or cooked.
Many fruit distributors store apples in controlled conditions that keep them fresh for several months before reaching grocery stores. For instance, apple bins are often treated with a gas called 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) ( 1 ,  2 ).
The use of 1-MCP prevents apples in storage from ripening by blocking the effects of ethylene, a colorless gas that drives the produce ripening process. However, ripening resumes once the apples are removed from these conditions ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
What matters most to consumers is how apples are  kept at home , including the temperature at which they are stored and whether they have been washed or cut.
Here are the approximate shelf lives of apples, depending on how they are prepared and stored ( 4 ):
On the counter:  5–7 days
In the pantry:  3 weeks
In the refrigerator:  4–6 weeks
Once cut:  3–5 days in the fridge, 8 months in the freezer
Made into applesauce:  7–10 days in the fridge, 2 months in the freezer
Cooked, as in the case of apple pie:  3–5 days in the fridge
The shelf life of apples varies from a few weeks to a few months, depending on how they are prepared and stored.

How to Peel an Apple

How to tell whether an apple has gone bad
Fresh apples feel firm, have bright  skin,  and smell pleasant and fruity. They won’t have bruises, soft spots, or areas of discoloration. When you bite into them, they are crispy and juicy.
Here are a few indications that an apple has begun to go bad:
soft spots or bruising
wrinkled skin
holes and brown blemishes
liquid oozing from its skin
a mushy texture
a mealy or bland and grainy taste
It’s best to discard apples that are soft or show other physical signs of expiration, as moisture content under the skin can indicate contamination ( 5 ).
You can usually tell whether an apple has started to go bad by examining its appearance. Apples that have gone bad should be discarded.

Risks of eating expired apples
Although eating apples that are starting to age isn’t always dangerous, apples are subject to  mold growth  just like other fresh produce.
Mold is caused by microorganisms and may cause allergic or respiratory reactions in some people. Some microorganisms grow mycotoxins, which are responsible for many foodborne illnesses ( 5 ,  6 ).
Apples are subject to a mycotoxin called patulin, which is produced by the  Penicillium expansum  species. When patulin is consumed in large amounts, it can cause  nausea  and bleeding ulcers and may even increase your risk of cancer ( 6 ,  7 ).
Mycotoxins can also disrupt your gut bacteria, which may negatively affect your immune system and increase your risk of developing other illnesses ( 8 ,  9 ).
It’s best to discard apples that show signs of expiration, as they carry the risk of toxic mold. Apples are especially at risk of growing mycotoxins like patulin, which can be dangerous to consume.

How to increase the shelf life of apples
Increasing the shelf life of apples can be as simple as practicing good produce storage habits at home.
Here are a few things you can do to help keep your apples as fresh as possible:
Do not wash your apples until you are ready to prepare and eat them ( 10 ).
Leave your apples in whole form until you are ready to eat them, as exposure to oxygen can increase the rate of oxidation and deterioration ( 11 ).
Store whole apples in the refrigerator crisper drawer instead of in the pantry or on the counter, as colder temperatures retain freshness longer ( 12 ).
Submerge cut apple slices in a mixture comprising 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of  lemon juice  per 1 cup (240 ml) of water to slow the browning that occurs as part of the natural oxidation process ( 13 ).
Wrap apples individually in plastic or a paper bag to prevent the spread of ethylene gas, which can promote the ripening of any surrounding apples ( 5 ).
By practicing some of these simple preparation and storage tips at home, you can enjoy fresh apples for longer.
Increase the shelf life of apples by storing them individually, unwashed, and whole at colder temperatures, such as in the fridge or freezer. Apple slices can be kept fresher with the help of an acid like lemon juice.

The bottom line
The shelf life of apples can vary from a few weeks to a few months.
How long  apples  retain their freshness is significantly affected by the temperature, form, and location in which they are stored.
The best way to keep apples fresh and ready to eat is to store them unwashed, in whole form, and individually wrapped in the refrigerator. This can keep them fresh for up to 6–8 weeks.
If you notice physical signs of expiration, such as bruising, soft spots, or oozing, it’s best to discard apples to prevent the intake of potentially dangerous compounds called mycotoxins.
