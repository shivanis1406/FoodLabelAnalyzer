Title: 11 Health and Nutrition Benefits of Yams



Yams are nutritious vegetables containing both macro- and micronutrients. They may have many health benefits, including relieving symptoms of menopause and lowering blood cholesterol levels.
Yams ( Dioscorea ) are a type of tuber vegetable that originated in Asia, Africa, and the Carribean ( 1 ).
They’re often mistaken for sweet potatoes. However, yams are less sweet and more starchy.
They have a distinct brown, bark-like exterior. The flesh can be white, yellow, purple, or pink depending on the maturity of the yam.
These tubers are highly nutritious, versatile, and may benefit your health in many ways.
Here are 11 health and nutrition benefits of yams.

1. Packed with nutrition
Yams are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
One cup (136 grams) of baked yams provides ( 2 ):
Calories:  158
Carbs:  37 grams
Protein:  2 grams
Fat:  0 grams
Fiber:  5 grams
Vitamin C:  18% of the Daily Value (DV)
Vitamin B5:  9% of the DV
Manganese:  22% of the DV
Magnesium:  6% of the DV
Potassium:  19% of the DV
Thiamine:  11% of the DV
Copper:  23% of the DV
Folate:  6% of the DV
Yams are not only an excellent source of fiber but also high in  potassium  and manganese, which are important for supporting bone health, growth, metabolism, and heart function ( 3 ,  4 ).
These tubers also provide decent amounts of other micronutrients, such as copper and vitamin C.
Copper is vital for red blood cell production and  iron absorption , while vitamin C is a strong antioxidant that can boost your immune system ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ).
Summary  Yams are packed with fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They’re particularly rich in potassium, manganese, copper, and vitamin C.

2. May enhance brain function
Eating yams may  boost your brain .
In one 12-week study, people who took a yam extract supplement scored higher on a brain function test than those in the placebo group ( 9 ).
Yams contain a unique compound called diosgenin, which has been found to promote neuron growth and enhance brain function ( 9 ).
Diosgenin has also improved memory and learning abilities in mice in various maze tests ( 10 ).
However, more research in this area is needed to fully understand how  yams  may benefit brain health.
Summary  Yams contain a unique compound called diosgenin, which may enhance memory and brain function.

3. May ease symptoms of menopause
Yams may help alleviate some  symptoms of menopause .
In one 30-day study, 24 postmenopausal women switched from their staple food of rice to eating yams in 2 out of 3 meals (390 grams total) per day. Their blood levels of estrone and estradiol increased by 26% and 27%, respectively ( 11 ).
Blood levels of estrone and estradiol — two estrogen  hormones  — typically decrease during menopause. Improving estrogen levels may ease menopause symptoms ( 12 ,  13 ).
Yet, another six-month study found that topically applied wild yam cream had very little effect on menopause symptoms, such as flushing and night sweats, compared with a placebo ( 14 ).
Further research is needed to investigate the role that yams may have in relieving menopause symptoms.
Summary  Yams may help alleviate symptoms of menopause. Still, the evidence is mixed, and more studies are needed to support these claims.

4. May have cancer-fighting properties
Yams provide several antioxidants that may have  anticancer properties  ( 15 ,  16 ).
In an animal study, a yam-rich diet significantly reduced colon tumor growth. These effects were associated with the antioxidants present in yams, suggesting that these tubers may protect against cancer ( 16 ,  17 ).
What’s more, a test-tube study found that extracts from Chinese yam, specifically the peel, inhibited liver tumor growth and offered  antioxidant  properties ( 18 ,  19 ).
However, research is limited, and studies have yet to test these effects in humans.
Summary  Animal and test-tube studies suggest that the antioxidants in yams may have anticancer effects. Still, human studies are lacking.

5. May reduce inflammation
The antioxidants in yams may help reduce inflammation.
Chronic inflammation is linked to an increased risk of various conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity ( 20 ,  21 ,  22 ).
Eating  anti-inflammatory foods , such as yams, can help manage chronic inflammation ( 23 ,  24 ).
Several rat studies have observed that yam powder reduced inflammation related to several illnesses, including colon cancer,  irritable bowel syndrome  (IBS), and stomach ulcers ( 16 ,  19 ,  25 ,  26 ).
Still, more studies are needed to determine whether eating yams has the same anti-inflammatory effects in humans.
Summary  The rich antioxidant content of yams helps reduce inflammation related to various diseases. However, more human research is needed to confirm these results.

6. May improve blood sugar control
Yams may improve your blood sugar levels.
In one study, rats given yam powder or yam water extract experienced decreased fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, compared with the control groups. HbA1c is a measure of long-term  blood sugar control  ( 27 ).
Another study found that rats given higher amounts of  purple yam  extract showed reduced appetites, greater weight loss, and improved blood sugar control, compared with a control group ( 28 ).
Furthermore, another study in rats found that supplementing with yam flour reduced the rate of blood sugar absorption, which led to improved blood sugar control. These effects are attributed to the resistant starch and fiber in yams ( 29 ).
Resistant starch passes through your gut undigested. This type of starch is linked to various health benefits, including decreased appetite, as well as improved blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity ( 30 ).
Summary  Several animal studies have found that yams improve blood sugar control. The effects are thought to be due to their rich resistant starch and dietary fiber contents.

7–10. Other potential benefits
Yams are associated with a number of other health benefits, including:
Improved digestive health.  Studies indicate that the  resistant starch  in yams may increase digestive enzymes that help break down food and increase the number of good bacteria in your gut ( 31 ,  32 ).
Weight loss.  One animal study found that yam extract reduced food intake, suggesting that these tubers may help reduce appetite and improve weight loss. The fiber in yams may promote  weight loss  as well ( 28 ).
Antimicrobial effects.  Though the exact mechanism is unknown, several studies observe that yam extract may protect against certain drug-resistant bacteria ( 33 ,  34 ).
Improved cholesterol levels.  In one study, women who ate 18 ounces (390 grams) of yams per day for 30 days experienced a 6% decrease in blood cholesterol levels ( 11 ).
Though yams’ rich nutritional content appears to provide numerous benefits, more human research is needed to study these effects in detail.
Summary  Due to the nutrient density of yams, eating them is associated with a number of health benefits, including weight loss, antimicrobial effects, and improved digestive health and cholesterol levels.

11. Easy to add to your diet
Due to their versatility, it’s easy to add yams to your diet. They can be bought whole or as a powder, flour, and even supplement.
These delicious tubers can be baked, boiled, steamed, roasted, fried, and pan-cooked.
Yams can be enjoyed with or without the skin and used in both sweet and savory dishes.
Here are some common ways to enjoy yams:
Yam fries.  Cut yams into wedges, add seasonings, and bake or fry them.
Purée.  Boil the tubers until soft, place in a blender, purée, and season them.
Yam chips.  Thinly slice peeled yams and bake or fry them.
Mashed yams.  Peel, boil, and mash your yams, then add  milk  and seasonings.
Baked yams.  Bake cubed yams until tender.
Cheesy yam gratin.  Thinly slice peeled yams and bake them with cheese and seasonings.
Yam hash.  Peel, dice, season, and then cook your yams in a pan.
Add into baked goods.  Use yam purée to add moisture to breads and muffins.
Adding different seasonings to your yam dishes, such as  cinnamon , nutmeg, oregano, or thyme, can diversify sweet and savory dishes.
Summary  Yams are nutritious, versatile, and easy to prepare, making them a great ingredient to cook with.

The bottom line
Yams are nutrient-dense tuber vegetables that come in many colors.
They’re a great  source of fiber , potassium, manganese, copper, and antioxidants.
Yams are linked to various health benefits and may boost brain health, reduce inflammation, and improve blood sugar control.
They’re versatile, easy to prepare, and a great vegetable to include in your diet in both sweet and savory dishes.
