Title: Cinnamon for Gums: Does It Help Treat Toothaches?

Cinnamon is a spice that has long been celebrated for its medicinal properties and warming aroma and flavor.
The spice is made of dried bark from various trees of the  Cinnamomum  genus, while cinnamon essential oils are extracted from the tree’s bark, leaves, fruits, and flowers.
Research   suggests  that some of the compounds in cinnamon have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic properties.
This may be why some people throughout history have used the spice to help treat toothaches and other ailments.
This article explores whether cinnamon may benefit your gums, oral health, and dental hygiene.

How cinnamon fights infections
Cinnamon’s antimicrobial properties may help fight off pathogens like bacteria and fungi.
Because many infections of the mouth are caused by bacteria and fungi, cinnamon has been studied as a potential treatment for dental ailments.
Some of the main  beneficial compounds  in cinnamon are:
cinnamaldehyde
cinnamic acid
cinnamyl acetate
cinnamyl alcohol
coumarin
eugenol
linalool
phenol
beta-caryophyllene
Cinnamaldehyde appears to be among the most powerful compounds in cinnamon. Additionally, the spice contains other healthy plant compounds known as  polyphenols .
These compounds fight bacteria by damaging their cell walls and preventing cell division, thereby inhibiting bacterial growth.
Multiple   studies  have found cinnamon bark oil to be effective against the  Streptococcus mutans  bacterium — a common cause of cavities, tooth decay, and enamel erosion — in children with cavities.
Cinnamon and cinnamaldehyde also  appear to be  effective against fungi, including strains of the  Candida  genus of yeasts.
Candida  strains are a common cause of yeast infections like oral thrush in the mouth and throat. It’s normal to have some  Candida  on your skin and in your body, but overgrowth and infections can occur in people with compromised immune systems.
One test-tube study  found that cinnamon oil fought  Candida albicans  directly, while cinnamon extracts displayed anti-inflammatory properties. Plus, both the oil and extracts helped prevent the growth of biofilm and strengthened the mouth’s protective barrier.
Another test-tube study  also found cinnamon oil prevented  Candida  biofilm.
Biofilm is a slimy layer of fungi or bacteria that often forms on teeth and in the mouth. Although biofilm is common, it can progress into  plaque  and gum disease if it’s not regularly brushed and flossed away.
Yet, even though cinnamon may help fight fungi strains and prevent the prevalence of biofilm, human studies are needed.

Does it work for toothaches?
Cavities, bacteria, and inflammation are all common causes of pain in the teeth, jaw, and other parts of the mouth.
Because certain compounds in cinnamon fight bacteria, they might help prevent  toothaches  from developing or progressing.
Furthermore, a  recent study  found that those who took a cinnamon powder capsule daily for 2 months had less inflammation and shorter, less intense migraine pain than those who took a placebo.
Although this study is not specific to toothaches, it demonstrates cinnamon’s potential anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties.
Other   studies  likewise support cinnamon supplements’ potential to increase antioxidant capacity, inhibit inflammation biomarkers, and significantly reduce levels of C-reactive protein and interleukin 6, two measures of inflammation.

Does it work for gingivitis?
Gingivitis is inflammation of the gums caused by plaque or bacteria. It often leads to swelling or bleeding and can be painful. If left untreated, gingivitis can progress to a more advanced stage of periodontal gum disease.
Promisingly, emerging research shows that cinnamon oils may have the potential to help prevent  gum infections .
One test-tube study  found that the essential oil of cinnamon bark may inhibit  Porphyromonas gingivalis , a type of bacteria that can cause gingivitis and gum disease (31).
Another test-tube study  further determined that cinnamon oil may act as an antibacterial agent against  Enterococcus   fecalis , which is another common cause of gum disease, especially among people who’ve had root canals.
However, human studies are needed to confirm whether cinnamon spice or essential oils can help treat these conditions outside of test tubes.

How to use cinnamon on teeth and gums
In traditional medicine, cinnamon is often applied directly to the affected areas in the mouth. Some may chew on cinnamon sticks, rinse with cinnamon water, or mix ground cinnamon with  honey  and apply it to the area in pain.
However, there’s limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of such techniques. Plus, most studies on cinnamon for toothaches and mouth infections have used either cinnamon extracts, essential oils, or individual compounds isolated from cinnamon — not the ground spice.
Thus, the best ways to use cinnamon for oral health and dental hygiene remain uncertain at this time, although a few studies have started investigating how cinnamon could be added to common products and become a part of your daily hygiene routine.
One  older study  found that chewing cinnamon gum for 20 minutes significantly reduced the number of bacteria in human saliva. However, the study was small, and similar effects were observed for sweetened gum that didn’t contain cinnamon.
A more recent study  observed that a cinnamon toothpaste helped reduce the presence of Streptococcus mutans.
Another study  found that cinnamon oil may prevent Candida biofilm from emerging on dentures and dental implants, suggesting that the oil could be used to clean dentures, retainers, mouth guards, and other dental appliances.
Overall, cinnamon and its compounds show potential as beneficial ingredients in toothpaste and powders, mouthwashes, chewing gums, teas, and more, but more research is needed.

Potential side effects
In general, cinnamon is considered safe for human use. No evidence has suggested that it could be toxic to cells in the mouth.
Nevertheless, there may be risks to using cinnamon for certain groups of people or those who apply it directly to their mouth.
For example,  one team of researchers  found that high exposure to cinnamon extract could change the tooth enamel — the outer layer of the tooth — and that overexposure may cause changes in tooth color.
Also, some people may be sensitive to cinnamon and cinnamon flavors and even react to cinnamon ingredients with swelling and inflammation of the mouth and lips.
What’s more, some people are  allergic to cinnamon . Some signs and symptoms include experiencing the following in the mouth and throat region:
swelling
burning
soreness
skin irritation
Lastly, consuming too much  cassia cinnamon  — the kind most commonly used in cooking — is associated with some health risks due to its high amounts of coumarin.

The bottom line
Cinnamon oils , extracts, and their compounds may help prevent cavities, treat gum disease, and fight fungal and bacterial infections. Thus, hygiene products containing cinnamon may have some uses for oral health and pain relief.
However, home remedies like chewing on cinnamon sticks or applying ground cinnamon directly to the mouth may not be effective. They can also pose risks for some groups of people, including those with allergies or sensitivities to the spice.
It’s best to consult your dentist or another trusted medical professional before attempting to use cinnamon or other home remedies to treat specific dental conditions.
