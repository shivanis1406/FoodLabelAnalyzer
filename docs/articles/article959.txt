Title: 8 Keto-Friendly Starbucks Drinks and Snacks

If you swing by Starbucks as a part of your daily routine, you may wonder how many of its beverages and foods are keto-friendly.
Although starting the ketogenic diet may involve transforming your food habits, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to cut out your favorite coffee chain altogether.
In fact, making a few modifications to your order can ensure that you’re still able to enjoy your Starbucks ritual while on this low carb, high fat diet.
Here are 9 of the best keto-friendly drinks and snacks available at Starbucks.
