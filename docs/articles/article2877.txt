Title: 14 Reasons Why You’re Always Hungry

Feeling hungry all the time may be a sign of dietary deficiencies, stress, not getting enough sleep, or hormone imbalances. Some tips to reduce hunger include eating enough protein and staying hydrated.
Hunger is your body’s natural cue that it needs more food.
When you’re hungry, your stomach may “growl” and feel empty, or you may get a headache, feel irritable, or be unable to concentrate.
Most people can go several hours between meals before feeling hungry again. However, you might also find yourself feeling hungry all the time, even right after eating.
Keep reading to learn more about 14 reasons for excessive hunger.

1. You’re not eating enough protein
Consuming  enough protein  is important for appetite management.
The authors of a  2020 review  found that protein has several hunger-reducing properties. For instance, it may help decrease the amount of  ghrelin  in your body, which is known as the “hunger” hormone. Eating enough protein may also  increase  the production of PYY and GLP-1. These two hormones play a role in regulating hunger.
The  amount of protein you need  to consume each day depends on several factors, such as your height, age, and weight management goals. That said, many foods are  high in protein , including animal products and  plant-based foods . Including a source of protein in every meal can help prevent excessive hunger.

2. You’re not sleeping enough
Getting adequate sleep is  important  for your health. It also plays a key role in appetite management.
A  2022 review  found that poor sleep over extended periods resulted in  lower leptin levels . Leptin is known as the “satiety” hormone because it helps promote feelings of fullness.
The authors also found that lower leptin levels caused ghrelin levels to increase, therefore affecting appetite.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that adults get at least  7 hours  of sleep per night.

3. You’re eating too many refined carbs
A  2022 review of scientific literature  suggests that carbohydrates do not keep you full for as long as protein. But the authors note that not all types of carbohydrates are to be avoided — only digestible carbs, or refined carbs.
Refined carbs  are highly processed foods that have  fiber ,  vitamins , and  minerals  stripped out of them.
Refined carbs are digested quickly and converted into glucose, which could lead to rapid spikes in your  blood sugar . This leads to  increased levels  of  insulin , a hormone responsible for transporting sugar into your cells.
Insulin removes sugar from your blood, which may lead to a sudden drop in blood sugar levels. This signals your body that it needs more food.
To reduce your refined carb intake, replace them with nutrient-rich  whole foods  like vegetables, fruit,  legumes , and  whole grains . These foods are still high in carbs, but they’re rich in fiber, which helps keep hunger well managed.

4. Your diet is low in fat
Fat  also plays a key role in keeping you full.
This is partly due to its slow gastrointestinal transit time, meaning that it takes longer for you to digest it, and it remains in your stomach for a long time. Eating fat may also lead to the release of various  fullness-promoting hormones , such as CCK, GLP-1, and PYY.
Many  healthy, high fat foods  can help keep you full for longer. Certain types of fats such as  medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs)  and  omega-3 fatty acids  may also be more beneficial for appetite management than others.
The richest food source of MCT is  coconut oil , while  omega-3 fatty acids  are found in fatty fish like  salmon ,  tuna , and  sardines . You can also get omega-3s from plant-based foods such as  walnuts  and  flaxseeds .
Other sources of nutrient-rich, high fat foods include  avocados ,  olive oil , and  eggs .

5. You’re not drinking enough water
Drinking  enough water  has several health-promoting benefits for your brain, heart, skin, and digestive health.
Research also shows that drinking water before a meal may help reduce the number of calories you consume.
For example, a small  2016 study  found that the participants who drank 2 cups of water before a meal ate almost 600 fewer calories than those who didn’t drink any water.
Feelings of dehydration may also be mistaken for feelings of hunger, which could  lead you  to eat more. Drinking 1–2 glasses of water between each meal may help suppress these feelings.
According to the  National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) , healthcare professionals recommend that adults drink six to eight 8-ounce (oz) glasses of water per day. Eating lots of  water-rich foods  will also contribute to your overall hydration needs.

6. Your diet lacks fiber
Fiber plays a  key role  in appetite management.
For example, it helps regulate your gastric emptying and increases your perceived feeling of satiety. This may help keep you feeling fuller for longer.
A high fiber intake also influences the release of appetite-reducing hormones and the production of  short-chain fatty acids . These have been shown to have fullness-promoting effects.
It’s important to note that there are different  types of fiber .
Soluble fiber  turns into a soft, gel-like substance during digestion because it absorbs water.
Insoluble fiber  moves through your intestine undissolved because it doesn’t absorb water.
Several  studies  have found that  soluble fiber  is more filling than insoluble fiber.
Consuming lots of  high fiber foods  like oatmeal, flaxseeds, and sweet potatoes may help keep your hunger well managed. Eating a diet rich in whole, plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains is the best way to ensure you’re getting enough fiber.

7. You eat while you’re distracted
Eating while you’re distracted may refer to on-the-go eating, eating while engaging with electronics, and eating while talking with others.
Distracted eating is associated with greater appetite, increased calorie intake, and weight gain.
A  2022 review of scientific literature  suggests that this may be due to impaired sensory awareness. For example, eating while doing another task affects the amount of energy your brain allocates to each task. This may prevent you from recognizing your body’s fullness signals as efficiently as when you’re not distracted.
Distracted eating may also affect your taste perception. This may lead to eating more frequently throughout the day, as well as consuming more food during meals.
To avoid distracted eating, try using mindful eating techniques, minimizing screen time, and silencing your electronic devices. This will allow you to sit down and taste your food, helping you better recognize your body’s fullness signals.

8. You exercise a lot
Individuals who  exercise  frequently burn a lot of calories.
Regular resistance exercise may help  speed up  your  basal metabolic rate (BMR) . This refers to the number of calories your body burns to perform its life-sustaining functions, such as breathing.
A 2011 study involving 10 males found that metabolic rate increased by  37%  for the day after engaging in a vigorous 45-minute workout, compared with another day when they did not exercise.
A higher BMR may cause you to burn more calories, which leads to increased hunger.
A  2015 research review  also suggests that long-term exercise tends to increase appetite. Energy may affect various hormonal and energy regulation systems in your body, which could increase your hunger.
That said, research on how exercise affects your BMR is mixed. For example, a  2021 study  involving 140 adolescents with overweight or obesity found that exercise did not affect BMR. As such, more research is needed on the role of exercise and metabolism.
One way to help prevent excessive hunger from exercise is eating more to  fuel your workouts . This may include eating foods that are high in fiber, protein, and healthy fats.
This mostly applies to those who are avid athletes and work out frequently at a high intensity or for long periods. If you exercise moderately, you probably don’t need to increase your calorie intake.

9. You’re drinking too much alcohol
Alcohol  is well known for its appetite-stimulating effects.
Alcohol may affect the part of your brain that controls judgment, desire, and reward. A  2021 study  found that drinking alcohol may increase your desire to eat food, as well as increase your food consumption.
Even a modest dose of alcohol may  increase  how much food you eat. This may be because alcohol is not satiating, which means that you may consume many calories but not feel full.
If you drink alcohol, it may also influence your hunger. For example, consuming alcohol  before or with meals  is associated with high energy intake.
If you drink, it’s best to consume alcohol moderately or avoid it completely to reduce its hunger-inducing effects.

10. You drink your calories
Liquid and solid foods affect your appetite in different ways.
Liquid foods, such as  smoothies  and  meal replacement shakes , are less satiating than solid foods. This is because liquids  are digested more quickly  than solid foods. As such, you may be hungrier more often than you would be if you ate more solid foods.
You may also be hungry more often if you consume a lot of  sugar-sweetened beverages , such as soda.  Research  suggests that these are not satiating and could promote hunger.
Furthermore,  research  suggests that liquid foods don’t have as great of an impact on the suppression of hunger-promoting hormones, compared with solid foods.
Eating liquid foods also takes less time than eating solid foods. This may lead you to want to eat more because you  don’t experience  the full sensations of eating and your brain hasn’t had enough time to process fullness signals.
To prevent frequent hunger, it may help to focus on incorporating more solid, whole foods into your diet.

11. You’re overly stressed
Excess, long-term  stress  has been associated with increasing appetite.
This may be due to its effects on increasing levels of  cortisol , a hormone that has been shown to  promote hunger  and food cravings. For this reason, you might find that you’re always hungry if you experience frequent stress.
Stress-relieving strategies  like physical activity, yoga, and deep breathing exercises may help reduce your stress levels. Consequently, this could help manage your appetite.

12. You’re taking certain medications
Several medications may increase your appetite as a side effect.
The  most common  appetite-inducing medications include  antipsychotics , such as clozapine and  olanzapine . Other medications that may lead to increased appetite include:
antidepressants, such as  tricyclic antidepressants  and  mirtazapine
corticosteroids
antiseizure drugs , such as  valproic acid ,  pregabalin , and perampanel ( Fycompa )
birth control , such as  progesterone
Speak with a healthcare professional if you suspect that medications are the cause of your frequent hunger. There may be alternative medications that don’t make you hungry.

13. You eat too fast
The rate at which you eat may play a role in how hungry you are.
A  2018 research review  suggests that eating more slowly and chewing each bite more times may increase satiety and reduce appetite. A  2023 review of scientific literature  found similar results. However, the authors note that some studies have also found no link between eating speed and satiety.
The hunger-reducing effects of eating more slowly and chewing more may be due to increased awareness of eating. Additionally, eating slowly and chewing thoroughly may also give your body and brain more time to release anti-hunger hormones and convey fullness signals.
These techniques are a part of  mindful eating . Other techniques to try if you’re always hungry include:
taking a few deep breaths before meals
putting your fork down between bites
increasing the extent to which you chew your food

14. You have a medical condition
Frequent hunger may be a symptom of certain health conditions, such as:
diabetes
hyperthyroidism
hypoglycemia
premenstrual syndrome
mental health conditions, such as  depression
If you suspect that you may have one of these conditions, speak with a doctor to receive a proper diagnosis and discuss treatment options.
