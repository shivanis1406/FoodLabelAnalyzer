Title: 11 Proven Health Benefits of Ginger

Ginger may have numerous health benefits due to its anti-inflammatory, anti-nausea, and other properties. It may help you lose weight, manage arthritis, reduce menstrual symptoms, and more.
Ginger comes from a flowering plant originating in Southeast Asia. It adds flavor to sweet and savory foods and has a range of health benefits. It belongs to the  Zingiberaceae  family, and it’s closely related to turmeric, cardamom, and galangal.
The rhizome (underground part of the stem) is the part commonly used as a spice. It’s often called ginger root or, simply, ginger.
You can use ginger fresh, dried, powdered, or as an oil or juice. It features in many recipes as well as processed foods, home remedies, and cosmetics.

What are 11 health benefits of ginger?
Here are 11 health benefits of ginger that are supported by scientific research.
Ginger has a long history of use in various forms of traditional and alternative medicine. It’s been used to aid digestion, reduce nausea, and help fight the flu and common cold, to name a few of its purposes.
The unique fragrance and flavor of ginger come from its natural oils, the most important of which is gingerol.
Gingerol is the main bioactive compound in ginger. It’s responsible for many of ginger’s medicinal properties.
Gingerol has powerful anti-inflammatory and  antioxidant  effects, according to  research . For instance, it may help reduce  oxidative stress , which results from having too many free radicals in the body.
What is ginger oil and does it have health benefits?
Ginger may be  effective  against nausea, including pregnancy-related nausea, commonly known as  morning sickness .
Ginger may help relieve nausea and vomiting for people undergoing certain types of surgery, and it may also help reduce  chemotherapy-related  nausea.
While generally safe, it’s best to talk with a doctor before taking large amounts if you’re pregnant.
Ginger  may not be suitable  during pregnancy for people who are close to labor and those with a history of pregnancy loss or vaginal bleeding. It may also be unsuitable for those with clotting disorders.

Ginger may  play a role in weight loss , according to studies in humans and animals.
One  2019 review  concluded that ginger supplementation significantly reduced body weight, the waist-hip ratio, and the hip ratio in people with overweight or obesity.
Ginger’s ability to influence weight loss may  be due to  certain mechanisms, such as its potential to reduce inflammation.

Osteoarthritis (OA)  involves degeneration of the joints, leading to  symptoms  such as joint pain and stiffness.
One  review  concluded that ginger may help reduce pain and disability.The participants took 0.5–1 gram of ginger per day for 3–12 weeks, depending on the study. Most had a diagnosis of OA of the knee.
However, other  research  has not found evidence of the same effects.
However, many discontinued treatment as they did not like the taste of ginger or because it upset their stomach.
Does ginger work for arthritis?
Some research suggests ginger may have anti-diabetic properties.
In a  2015 study , 41 people with  type 2 diabetes  took 2 grams of ginger powder per day.
A  2022 review  found a significant reduction in fasting blood sugar and HbA1c in people with type 2 diabetes after taking ginger supplements.
The review looked at results from 10 trials, in which participants took 1,200–3,000 milligrams (mg) per day for 8–13 weeks.
The results did not suggest that ginger supplements affected the lipid profile.
A high apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I ratio and high levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) can result from oxidative stress, a byproduct of oxidative stress. They are both risk factors for  heart disease .
However, this was one small study, and more research is needed to confirm these results.
A  2019 review  also found evidence that ginger can reduce HbA1c in people with type 2 diabetes, but the authors did not conclude that it can lower fasting blood sugar levels.
Is ginger good for people with diabetes?
Ginger may help manage  indigestion  by speeding up the passage of food through the stomach.
Functional dyspepsia is when a person has indigestion — with symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, feeling too full, belching, and nausea — for no clear reason. It often occurs with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
In one study,  scientists  found that consuming a ginger and artichoke preparation before eating a main meal significantly improved the symptoms of indigestion in people with functional dyspepsia, compared with taking a placebo.
What are the uses of ginger tea?
Ginger may help relieve dysmenorrhea, also known as  menstrual pain .
Some  research  has suggested that ginger is as effective as acetaminophen/caffeine/ibuprofen (Novafen) in relieving menstrual pain.
However, more studies are needed.
How can ginger and other natural remedies help with menstrual pain?
High levels of LDL (bad)  cholesterol  are  linked to  an increased risk of heart disease.
In a  2022 review  of 26 trials, researchers found that ginger consumption significantly reduced triglycerides and LDL cholesterol, while increasing HDL cholesterol. Even doses less than 1,500 mg per day were effective.
However, it may be hard to include such high doses of ginger in your diet, particularly if you don’t like the taste of ginger.
What is ginger water, and is it useful?
Ginger may have anticancer properties due to gingerol and various other antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds.
There is some  evidence  that these compounds may help reduce the risk of gastrointestinal cancers,  such as  colorectal, pancreatic, and liver cancer.
In  one study , 20 people with a high risk of colorectal cancer took 2 g of ginger daily for 28 days. At the end of the study, the lining of the participant’s intestines showed fewer cancer-like changes than expected.
However, most studies relating to ginger and cancer risk have not involved humans.

Some  research  suggests that 6-shogaol and 6-gingerol — compounds in ginger — may help prevent degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis.
Oxidative stress and  chronic inflammation  may be key drivers of  Alzheimer’s disease  and age-related cognitive decline.
Some animal  studies  suggest the antioxidants and bioactive compounds in ginger can inhibit inflammatory responses that occur in the brain. This may help prevent cognitive decline.
Ginger’s antimicrobial properties could make it useful for fighting bacterial and fungal infections.
Laboratory  studies  have found it may be effective against:
Staphylococcus aureus   (S. aureus) , which is responsible for a range of diseases
Escherichia coli   (E. coli) , a cause of intestinal infections
Candida albicans   (C. albicans) , which causes fungal infections in the mouth, vagina, and so on
However, more studies are needed.
