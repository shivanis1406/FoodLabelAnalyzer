Title: 25 Simple Tips to Make Your Diet Healthier

You can eat healthier by making a few swaps, such as choosing whole grains over refined grains and eating more protein.
A diet rich in fruits and vegetables has been scientifically proven to provide numerous health benefits, such as reducing your risk of several chronic diseases and strengthening your immune system.
Making major changes to your diet can sometimes seem very overwhelming. It may be more manageable to start with just one thing — like eating more of your favorite fruit — rather than all of them at once.
This article discusses 25 ways to make your usual diet slightly healthier over time.

Plating and pacing your meals
The size of your dinnerware  can affect  how much you eat. Eating from a large plate can make your portion look smaller, while eating from a small plate can make it look bigger.
According to  one 2017 study , eating from a smaller plate was associated with increased feelings of satiety and reduced energy intake among participants with a moderate body weight.
Also, if you don’t realize you’re eating less than usual, you  won’t compensate  by eating more at the next meal. By eating from smaller dinnerware, you can trick your brain into thinking that you’re eating more, making yourself less likely to overeat.
A good way to ensure you eat your greens is to enjoy them as a starter.
By doing so, you’ll most likely finish all of your greens while you’re at your hungriest. This may cause you to eat fewer, perhaps less nutritious, meal components later.
It may lead you to eat fewer calories overall, which could result in weight loss. Plus, eating vegetables before a  carb-rich meal  has been shown to benefit blood sugar levels.
It  slows the speed  at which carbs are absorbed into the bloodstream and  may benefit  short- and long-term blood sugar control in people with diabetes.
Getting to the point of being able to order a salad at a restaurant is a great achievement for many.
However, not all salads are equally nutritious. In fact, some salads are smothered in high calorie dressings, which may make the salads even higher in calories than other items on the menu.
Asking for the  dressing on the side  makes it a lot easier to control the  portion size  and amount of calories that you consume.
The pace at which you eat influences how much you eat, as well as how likely you are to gain weight.
In fact,  studies comparing  different eating speeds show that fast eaters are much  more likely  to eat more and have a higher body mass index (BMI) than slow eaters.
Your appetite, how much you eat, and how full you get are all  controlled by hormones . Hormones signal to your brain whether you’re hungry or full.
However, it takes about 20 minutes for your brain to receive these messages. That’s why  eating more slowly  may give your brain the time it needs to perceive that you’re full.
Studies have confirmed this,  showing that  eating slowly may reduce the number of calories you consume at meals and  help you lose weight .
Eating slowly is  also linked  to more thorough chewing, which has also  been linked  to improved weight control.
So, simply eating slower and chewing more often may help you eat less.

Grocery shopping, meal planning, and fast food
There are two important strategies to employ when you go  grocery shopping : Make your shopping list ahead of time and don’t go to the store hungry.
Not knowing exactly what you need makes room for impulse buying, while hunger can cause you to toss even more low-nutrient foods into your shopping cart.
That’s why the  best strategy  is to plan ahead and write down what you need beforehand. By doing this and sticking to your list, you’ll not only buy healthier items to keep around the house, but you’ll also  save money .
So-called diet foods can be very deceiving. They have usually had their fat content reduced dramatically and are often labeled “fat-free,”  “low fat,”  “fat-reduced,” or “low calorie.”
However, to compensate for the lost flavor and texture from fat, sugar, and other ingredients are often added.
So, many diet foods contain  more sugar  and sometimes even more calories than their full-fat counterparts. Instead, opt for  whole foods  like fruits and vegetables.
Try to make a habit of cooking at home most nights rather than eating out. For one, it’s often easier on your budget.
Second, by cooking your food yourself, you’ll know exactly what’s in it. You won’t have to wonder about any  hidden ingredients .
Also, by cooking large servings, you’ll  have leftovers  for the next day, ensuring a satisfying meal then, too.
Finally, cooking at home has been associated with a  lower risk  of obesity and  improved  diet quality, especially among children.
Deciding what to have for dinner can be a constant cause of frustration, which is why many people tend to use the same recipes again and again. Chances are you’ve been cooking the same recipes on autopilot for years.
Whether these are more or less nutritious recipes,  trying something new  can be a fun way to add more diversity to your diet.
Aim to try making a  new health-focused recipe  at least once per week. This can change up your food and nutrient intakes and hopefully add some new and nutritious recipes to your routine.
Alternatively, try to make a healthier version of a favorite recipe by experimenting with new ingredients, herbs, and spices.
How  you prepare your food  can drastically change its effects on your health.
Grilling, broiling, frying, and deep-frying are all popular methods of preparing meat and fish.
However, during these types of cooking methods, several potentially toxic compounds are formed. These include:
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
advanced glycation end products
heterocyclic amines
All of these compounds have been linked to several health conditions, including  cancer  and  heart disease .
Healthier cooking methods include:
baking
broiling
poaching
pressure cooking
simmering
slow cooking
stewing
sous-vide
These methods  don’t promote  the formation of these harmful compounds and may make your food healthier.
Although you can still enjoy the occasional grilled or deep-fried dish, it’s best to use those methods sparingly.
Eating out doesn’t have to involve less nutritious foods. Consider upgrading your favorite fast-food restaurant to one with healthier options.
There are many  high-quality fast food restaurants  and fusion kitchens offering nutritious meals.

Foods to add to your overall diet
Protein  is often referred to as the king of nutrients, and it does seem to have some superpowers.
Due to its ability to affect your hunger and satiety hormones, it’s  often considered  the most filling of the macronutrients.
One  2018 study  showed that eating a high-protein meal decreased levels of ghrelin, the hunger hormone, more than a high carb meal in people with obesity.
What’s more, protein  helps you  retain muscle mass and  may also  slightly increase the number of calories you burn per day. It’s also important for  preventing  the loss of muscle mass that can occur with weight loss and as you age.
If you’re trying to lose weight, aim to add a source of protein to each meal and snack. It will help you feel fuller for longer, curb cravings, and make you less likely to overeat.
Good sources of protein  include:
dairy products
nuts
peanut butter
eggs
beans
lean meat
Greek yogurt  (or Greek-style yogurt) is thicker and creamier than regular yogurt.
It has been strained to remove its excess whey, which is the watery part of milk. This produces a final product with higher fat and protein than regular yogurt.
Eating a good source of protein  can help  you feel fuller for longer, which can help manage your appetite and reduce your food intake if that’s your goal.
Plus, since Greek yogurt has been strained, it contains fewer carbs and less lactose than regular yogurt. This makes it suitable for people who follow a  low carb diet  or are lactose intolerant.
Just make sure to pick the plain, unflavored varieties. Flavored yogurts may be packed with added sugar and other less nutritious ingredients.
When studying various types of calorie-matched breakfasts, eggs come out on top.
Eggs are rich in high quality protein and  many essential nutrients  that people often don’t get enough of, such as choline.
Eating eggs in the morning increases feelings of fullness. This has been shown to cause people to consume fewer calories at later meals. It can be quite helpful for  weight loss  if that’s your goal.
For example, one  2020 study  of 50 people found that eating an egg-based breakfast reduced feelings of hunger and decreased the amount of calories consumed later in the day than a breakfast of cereal.

Swaps and substitutions to consider
Sugary beverages are loaded with added sugar, which  has been linked  to numerous diseases, including:
heart disease
obesity
type 2 diabetes
Plus, the added sugar found in these drinks  doesn’t impact  appetite the same way that nutrient-rich food does.
Unlike meal replacement drinks, which are rich in essential nutrients, sugary beverages are usually made up of  “empty calories”  that are unlikely to leave you satiated.
Try replacing your sugary beverage with either a sugar-free alternative or choose still or sparkling water instead. Doing so will shave off the non-beneficial calories and reduce excess sugar intake.
Coffee is rich in antioxidants and has been linked to  many health benefits , such as a lower risk of  type 2 diabetes ,  cognitive decline , and  chronic liver disease .
However, many  commercial varieties  of coffee contain lots of additional ingredients, such as sugar, syrup, heavy cream, and sweeteners.
Drinking these varieties quickly negates all of coffee’s health benefits and instead adds lots of extra sugar and calories.
Instead, try drinking your coffee black or adding a small amount of milk or cream instead of sugar.
Studies have  repeatedly linked  eating fruit to a reduced risk of several health conditions, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and  cancer .
Because  fruits  contain fiber and various plant compounds, their natural sugars are generally digested very slowly and don’t cause major spikes in blood sugar levels. However, the same doesn’t apply to  fruit juices .
Many fruit juices aren’t even made from real fruit but rather concentrate and sugar. Some varieties may contain as much sugar as a sugary soft drink.
Even real fruit juices lack the fiber and chewing resistance of whole fruits. This makes fruit juice much more likely to spike your blood sugar levels, leading you to consume too much in a single sitting.
Refined grains have been associated with many health concerns.  Whole grains , on the other hand, have been linked to a variety of health benefits, including a reduced risk of  type 2 diabetes ,  heart disease , and  cancer .
Whole grains are also a good source of:
fiber
B vitamins
zinc
iron
magnesium
manganese
Just make sure to  read the label  to ensure that your bread is made with whole grains only, not a mixture of whole and refined grains. It’s also preferable that the bread contains whole seeds or grains.
It may be surprising that  popcorn  is a whole grain that’s loaded with nutrients and fiber.
A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of air-popped popcorn  contains  387 calories and 15 grams of fiber, while the same amount of potato chips  contains  532 calories and only 3 grams of fiber.
Diets rich in whole grains have been linked to health benefits, such as a reduced risk of  inflammation  and  heart disease .
For a satisfying snack, try popping your own kernals at home or purchase air-popped popcorn. Just be sure to limit or avoid prepacked microwavable portions with preservatives, butter, and other additives.
Berries are packed with nutrients, fiber, and antioxidants. Most varieties can be purchased fresh, frozen, or dried.
Although all types are  relatively healthy , dried berries are a much more concentrated source of calories and sugar since all the water has been removed.
Dried varieties are also often covered with added sugar, further increasing the sugar content. By opting for fresh berries, you will get a much juicier snack that’s lower in sugar and contains fewer calories.
Highly processed seed and vegetable oils have become a household staple over the past few decades. Examples include soybean, cottonseed, sunflower, and canola oils. These oils are high in omega-6 fatty acids but low in heart-healthy omega-3s.
Some research  suggests a high  omega-6 to omega-3 ratio  can lead to inflammation and  has been linked  to chronic conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis, and autoimmune disorders.
Swap these oils for less processed alternatives, such as:
extra virgin olive oil
avocado oil
coconut oil
Potatoes  are filling and a common side to many dishes. That said, the method in which they’re prepared largely determines their impact on health.
For starters, 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of baked potatoes  contains  93 calories, while the same amount of french fries  contains  over 3 times as many (333 calories).
Furthermore, deep-fried french fries  generally contain  harmful compounds such as aldehydes and  trans fats .
Replacing your french fries with baked or boiled potatoes is a great way to shave off calories and avoid these less nutritious compounds.

Water intake, supplements, and other lifestyle changes
Drinking  enough water  is important for your health.
Many studies  have shown  that drinking water can increase  weight loss  and promote  weight maintenance . It may even  slightly increase  the number of calories you burn daily.
Studies  also show  that drinking water before meals can reduce your appetite and food intake during the following meal.
That said, the most important thing is to drink water  instead  of other beverages. This may drastically  reduce  your intake of sugar and calories.
Approximately  1 billion people  around the globe are  deficient in vitamin D .
Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that’s  very important  for bone health and the  proper functioning  of your immune system. In fact, every cell in your body has a receptor for vitamin D, indicating its importance.
Vitamin D is found in very few foods, but fatty seafood generally contains the highest amounts.
Omega-3 fatty acids  are another commonly lacking nutrient that’s found in fatty seafood. These have many important bodily roles,  including  reducing inflammation, maintaining heart health, and promoting proper brain function.
If you don’t eat fatty seafood regularly, you should consider taking a  supplement . Omega-3s and vitamin D can often be found together in many supplements.
Good nutrition and exercise often go hand in hand.  Exercise  has been shown to improve your mood, as well as decrease feelings of  depression ,  anxiety , and  stress .
These are the exact feelings that are most likely to contribute to  emotional  and  binge eating .
Aside from strengthening your muscles and bones, exercise may help you:
lose weight
increase your energy levels
reduce your risk of chronic diseases
improve your sleep
Aim to do about 30 minutes of moderate to high intensity exercise each day, or take the stairs and take short walks whenever possible.
The  importance of good sleep  can’t be overstated.
Sleep deprivation  disrupts  appetite regulation, often leading to increased appetite. This can result in increased calorie intake and weight gain.
In fact, people who sleep too little  tend to weigh  significantly more than those who get enough sleep.
Being sleep-deprived also  negatively affects  concentration, productivity, athletic performance, glucose metabolism, and immune function.
Moreover, it increases your risk of several diseases, including  inflammatory conditions  and  heart disease .
That’s why it’s important to try to get  adequate amounts  of good-quality sleep, preferably in one bout.

The bottom line
Completely overhauling your diet or lifestyle all at once can be a recipe for disaster. Instead, try incorporating some of the changes listed above one or two at a time to gradually improve your diet.
Some of these tips will help you keep your portion sizes in check, while others will help you add nutrients or adapt to something new.
Together, these changes can add up to create a big impact on your overall health and well-being.
