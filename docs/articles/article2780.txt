Title: Feeling Nostalgic? Try DIY Food Gift Baskets from the ’70s, ’80s, ’90s and ’00s


A quick look at the best DIY nostalgic gift baskets:
The 1970s:   Fondue Dinner Basket ,  Game of Cards Basket
The 1980s:   “The Breakfast Club” Basket ,  Crafting and Styling Basket
The 1990s:   ’90s Work-from-Home Survival Kit ,  Sitcom and Sleepover Basket
The (early) 2000s:   Cupcake Craze Basket ,  Health Champion Basket
Stuck in a gift-giving rut this year? Keep the joy in giving with the gift of nostalgia!
Everyone has a decade they love and remember, so why not use those fond memories to create the perfect gift? The best part is that this type of giving feels more personal than wrapping another random pair of socks.
A themed gift allows you to flex your creative muscles and, better yet, helps you stay organized.
It’s easy too! Simply fill a basket or box with nostalgic items that embrace the decade, wrap it up, and give it away!

DIY tips
Determine your budget:  It’s easy to get carried away, so have a number in mind before you start buying.
Shop resale:  Consider shopping at thrift stores, resale shops, garage sales, and antique stores rather than buying everything new.
Make the container part of the theme:  Skip the gift bag and use something fun — like a milk crate, picnic basket, or antique lunch box — to package your gift.
Be creative and have fun:  The best part about a DIY gift is that you can create it however you want. Throw in snacks, beverages, or kitchen tools that fit your theme.
Let your decade be your guide:  It can be a challenge to find gifts, but not when you have a decade theme! Use it as the guide for everything going into the gift to help inspire you.

How we chose
We chose products that fit appropriately within each decade. While most of the items are not the exact products from that era, they still provide that key nostalgia factor — just with a healthier or more modern twist.
And even though we don’t have any antiques or resale items linked directly, feel free to add them or substitute them for other items in the gift baskets.
When building each gift basket, we considered the following factors:
Theme:  Do the items fit the theme for each decade?
Fun:  Do the items feel gift-worthy?
Cost:  Are the gifts affordable? And if not, are there similar but more affordable alternatives to fit any budget?
Nutritional value:  Do any food items included provide a slightly healthier twist on the original without losing the key flavor experience?

DIY gift basket ideas for kids of the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s
We’ve designed two DIY gift baskets to celebrate each decade. Keep in mind that these ideas are intended to be used as a starting point and provide inspiration. Feel free to customize and be creative. After all, you know your recipient better than we do!

The 1970s
Remember disco? And disco balls? Even if you weren’t there, there’s a good chance you know someone who was or someone who simply loves that decade. For that person in your life, try one of these ideas.
Fondue reached its height of popularity in the ’70s, so we’ve created a fondue-themed basket that will make anyone’s mouth water! We recommend including both cheese and chocolate so the recipient can enjoy both savory and sweet fondue!
What you’ll need:
Cuisinart Electric Fondue Pot :  No, this fondue pot isn’t vintage. Instead, it has an easy-to-clean nonstick interior and eight temperature settings perfect for melting your recipient’s favorite cheeses and chocolates.
A good loaf of crusty bread:  Bread is necessary for fondue and looks great in a gift basket. We recommend picking up a whole grain baguette from your favorite local bakery.
Cheese:  Add a block (or two or three) of buttery, creamy cheese, such as Gouda, Gruyere, Emmentaler, or cheddar. You can purchase cheese from your neighborhood supermarket or a local cheese shop.
Belgian Boys Almond Butter Cakes :  Instead of traditional pound cake, we recommend these mini almond butter cakes from Belgian Boys — we promise they’re just as delightful, especially when drizzled with melted chocolate.
Ghirardelli Melting Wafers :  Speaking of chocolate, these wafers our favorite for their rich flavor and silky-smooth texture when melted.
Paper Source Wavy Lines Cocktail Napkins :  Any napkin will do, but these offer a groovy ’70s vibe.
Mason Stoneware Appetizer Plates from Pottery Barn :  These little appetizer plates are a simple yet elegant addition that your recipient will use again and again.
Swap out the cocktail napkins and plates for some  fresh produce  for dipping, such as apples, pears, strawberries, broccoli, cauliflower, or carrots. Not only are these items less expensive and easier to find, but they’ll also provide a boost of color and nutrients.
A party in the ’1970s wouldn’t be the same without cocktails — or  mocktails  — and cards. So go with the poker theme and have fun.
What you’ll need:
Seedlip Non-Alcoholic Spirits :  Made with natural ingredients and packaged in beautiful bottles, Seedlip Spirits are the perfect alcohol-free gift for fans of distilled spirits and classic cocktails.
Hatch Rocks Glasses :  Beautiful glasses are key for any cocktail, even the zero-proof variety. We love the classic look of these rocks glasses from Crate and Barrel.
Cocktail stirrers :  A nice drink stirrer makes any drink feel classic and classy. We love these simple ones, but if you can find vintage versions, go for it.
Flavored nuts :  Provide a bar-like feel with a bag of flavored  nuts . Whether your recipient prefers sweet or salty, this website has you covered with creative flavors to suit any taste buds.
Bicycle playing cards  and  poker chips :  Bicycle cards are classic, but feel free to swap the deck out for a more personalized set or grab clay poker chips to upgrade the gift.
Poker visors :  A poker visor adds a fun and silly yet classic element to a poker night basket.
Upcycled Record Coasters :  Guests will need a place for their zero-proof cocktails, and we love that these coasters are made from reclaimed records.
Zero-proof mixology is an emerging art. You can help your recipient learn how to shake up an alcohol-free version of their favorite drink with “ Zero Proof Drinks and More .”

The 1980s
Neon everything, jelly bracelets, banana clips, and mixtapes were, like, gnarly. These gift basket ideas celebrate being a kid or teen in the ’80s.
This 1980s John Hughes movie is a cult classic. Everyone saw it, and everyone could relate to it. This gift idea is a riff on the movie’s title using a popular 1980s breakfast dish, quiche lorraine, as inspiration. Encourage your recipient to make the dish while enjoying this forever-popular movie.
What you’ll need:
Quiche pan :  A beautiful pan with an ’80s touch! We love the light green color, but there are plenty of options for personalizing. Don’t forget to throw in a vintage (or modern) recipe card for quiche lorraine.
OXO serving spatula :  Your recipient will need a way to cut and remove the quiche from the pan, and this server from OXO makes the job easy.
Stumptown Coffee :  Stumptown Coffee is a purchase you can feel good about thanks to the company’s Direct Trade sourcing model. Plus, the  coffee  is delicious. But you can always swap in a bag from a local roaster instead.
Coffee mug :  Keep the theme going with this movie-inspired mug.
“The Breakfast Club” DVD  (or download):  Go all-in on the theme by providing a DVD or Blu-Ray disc of the movie. No DVD player? Include an Amazon gift card that your recipient can redeem for a digital download instead.
If you aren’t shipping the gift, you can throw in some of the ingredients for the quiche just before gifting. You could also add ’80s-inspired oven mitts or a potholder — Etsy is a great place to look!
It wasn’t a 1980s sleepover without some kind of crafting! Grab your puffy paints and sparkling beverage and give the gift of crafting fun!
What you’ll need:
Caboodles :  Yes, Caboodles still exist, and yes, they’re still magical. You can choose from more than 57 classic cases to fit your recipient’s style. We recommend packaging the gift in one of these cases instead of a basket.
Puffy paint :  The classic puffy paint that you know and remember. Consider buying a larger set with more colors to keep the crafting going!
Canvas for crafting:  T-shirts are classic, but you could also paint on aprons, socks, or sweatshirts. Pick one or a few.
SmartSweets Sour Gummy Candy :  Sour gummy candy became a “thing” in the ’80s. While we love the classics, SmartSweets gummies are a  healthier alternative  because they’re low in added sugar and free from artificial colors and sweeteners.
Leitz Alcohol-Free Sparkling Riesling :  Sparkling anything is super fun, so why not add a 4-pack of zero-proof sparkling wine to sip on while crafting?
Lesser Evil Himalayan Gold Popcorn :  Microwave popcorn was a must at any ’80s slumber party. However, we recommend going a slightly healthier route with Lesser Evil Himalayan Gold Popcorn.
Every side ponytail deserves a scrunchie. We love  these waffle-knit ones  from Scünci — the OG scrunchie company — but you can also shop locally or on Etsy to find handmade versions.

The 1990s
Pagers, “Saved by the Bell,” Pearl Jam, and flannel were peaking in the ’90s. We used that as our guide to shape the gift sets below!
With many people still working from home, why not create a ’90s-themed gift for your friend or co-worker who loves all things from that decade?
What you’ll need:
’90s composition book :  It’s more fun to take notes in a ’90s-inspired composition notebook, and we think your recipient will agree.
Gel pens :  Remember gel pens? Of course you do! Here’s a great set to bring back all the good memories of passing notes in school.
BEAR Real Fruit Yoyos :  Fruit Roll-Ups and Fruit by the Foot were staples in ’90s lunch boxes. BEAR Real Fruit Yoyos are a healthier alternative to those brightly colored fruit snacks. Available in four flavors, they’re free of added sugar and contain just four whole-food ingredients.
Pop Rocks :  Enough said.
’90s Nickelodeon coffee mug :  This nostalgic-themed coffee mug will take your recipient back to a time when shows like “Rugrats,” “Clarissa Explains It All,” “All That,” and “Nick News” ruled the TV scene.
Floppy disk coasters :  Take your recipient back to the simple days of digital storage with these floppy disk drink coasters.
For a caffeine boost, include a bag of your recipient’s favorite coffee beans or loose-leaf tea — we love  these gift sets from Sips By .
So many great shows with so many iconic one-liners! Give this to your pal who adores the shows from the ’90s, along with a few snacks and fun games!
What you’ll need:
“Friends” DVD  (or download):  The show that launched a multitude of crazes makes the perfect gift for this decade! Also consider other iconic ’90s shows like “Seinfeld” or “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.”
Drink pouches :  Offering the fun of a Capri Sun, these resealable juice pouches can be filled with any beverage, and they even come with fun, multicolored twisty straws.
Garden of Eatin’ Spicy Tortilla Chips :  A spicy tortilla chip, reminiscent of a popular chip of the time, is the perfect food to enjoy while watching “Friends”!
Magic Spoon Cereal :  Every good sleepover includes cereal. We love this brand’s nutritious take on childhood classics.
Sorry! :  Game time should include the classic board game Sorry!, which was popular in the ’90s.
Mad Libs :  What’s more fun than this fill-in-the-blank game? You can pick up any of the available books of Mad Libs.
It wouldn’t be the ’90s without a grunge band T-shirt or a flannel button-down. Look online or at local vintage shops for a shirt with your recipient’s favorite band or pattern.

The (early) 2000s
Grab your cellphone and smoothie and rush out the door.
Wellness and sustainability movements picked up steam in the early 2000s. But let’s not forget that viral food trends also rocked the past two decades, from cupcakes and cake pops to cronuts and doughnuts. These baskets celebrate both.
Perfectly portioned cupcakes make it easy to enjoy cake even when you aren’t celebrating a birthday. And they became even more popular in the early 2000s thanks to Magnolia Cupcakes’ appearance in “Sex in the City.” This kit is perfect for the baker with a sweet tooth!
What you’ll need:
Cupcake liners :  We love these simple cupcake liners made from natural 100% wood pulp, but feel free to make swaps to better fit your theme.
Fancy Sprinkles :  If you want to take the sprinkle game up a notch, grab a few fun varieties from Fancy Sprinkles to add to the gift.
Ateco Cake Decorating Set :  A set like this can make anyone feel like a cupcake professional.
Ateco offset spatula :  This tool is awesome for frosting cakes and cupcakes but also great for other culinary applications.
Hedley & Bennett apron :  High quality aprons that will last a lifetime! We love Hedley & Bennett aprons, but feel free to find something locally made instead.
“ The Complete Magnolia Bakery Cookbook ”:  Don’t leave the recipient hanging! Give them the book from the bakery that started the cupcake craze.
Package your bakery basket items in a cupcake carrier like  this double-decker one .
Moving into the 2010s and beyond, whole grains became popular (yay,  quinoa !), and grain bowls began their reign as a new lunchtime favorite. Not to mention the rise of boutique athletic wear.
What you’ll need:
“ Bowls: Vibrant Recipes with Endless Possibilities ”:  This cookbook from America’s Test Kitchen is a must-have for any healthy eater in your life.
Smoothie cup with lid and straw :  Smoothies always taste better in a designated cup with a straw. We love this version from Yeti, but you can also grab one from a local craft store and personalize it yourself.
Material Kitchen reBoard :  A good cutting board makes all the difference. Material Kitchen’s boards come in six colors and are made from kitchen plastic scraps and renewable sugarcane.
Athleisure from Girlfriend Collective :  Girlfriend Collective is an  eco-friendly brand  offering stylish, gift-worthy pieces. In addition to fabrics made from recycled materials, the company prides itself on offering sizes for every body.
If you still have room in your budget, consider adding the gift of groceries with a Whole Foods or  Hungry Root gift card . You can also consider packaging your gift in a reusable canvas grocery bag.

The bottom line
Creating a decade-themed gift can be a fun option for both the giver and the recipient.
Consider your budget before you get started, and then use the theme to guide you. You can search resale shops for gifts and have fun with the gifting container.
