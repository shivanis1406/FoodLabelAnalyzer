Title: 7 Reasons You Should Eat More Asparagus

Asparagus can be enjoyed raw or cooked, and it’s often a star ingredient in soups, stews, salads, and other dishes. Asparagus benefits include its low caloric value and its high vitamin, mineral, and antioxidant content.
Asparagus, officially known as Asparagus officinalis, is a member of the lily family.
This popular vegetable comes in green, white, and purple colors. It’s used in dishes worldwide, including frittatas, pasta, and stir-fries.
This article uncovers 7 health benefits of asparagus, all supported by science.

1. Many nutrients but few calories
Asparagus is low in calories but boasts an impressive nutrient profile.
In fact, just  half a cup (90 g)  of cooked asparagus contains.
Calories:  20
Protein:  2.2 g
Fat:  0.2 g
Fiber:  1.8 g
Vitamin C:  12% of the RDI
Vitamin A:  18% of the RDI
Vitamin K:  57% of the RDI
Folate:  34% of the RDI
Potassium:  6% of the RDI
Phosphorous:  5% of the RDI
Vitamin E:  7% of the RDI

2. Good source of antioxidants
Antioxidants are compounds that help protect your cells from the harmful effects of free radicals and oxidative stress.
Oxidative stress  contributes to aging, chronic inflammation, and many diseases,  including  cancer.
Like other green vegetables, asparagus is high in  antioxidants . These  include  vitamin E, vitamin C,  and glutathione, as well as various flavonoids and polyphenols.
It’s especially high in the  flavonoids  quercetin, isorhamnetin, and kaempferol.  Several human, test-tube, and animal studies  have found  these substances to have  a variety of health benefits.
What’s more, purple asparagus, in particular,  contains  powerful pigments called anthocyanins, which give the vegetable its vibrant color and have antioxidant effects on the body.
In fact, anthocyanin intake  has been shown  to positively impact heart health, including helping lower the risk of heart disease.

3. May improve digestive health
Dietary  fiber  is essential for good digestive health. Just half a cup of asparagus contains  1.8 g of fiber , which is 7% of your daily needs.
In addition,  research  on the different parts of the asparagus plant found that they’re all rich in essential minerals, antioxidants, and natural probiotics like inulin, which may help promote the growth of healthy gut bacteria.
Based on  animal research , asparagus may also have a laxative effect, which may help with chronic constipation. That said, more human research is necessary.

4. May help lower blood sugar
High blood sugar levels, also known as hyperglycemia, can cause serious health problems such as diabetes.
Several  animal studies  have found that an asparagus extract helps lower blood sugar in diabetic rats. These studies have also shown similar effectiveness to the medication glibenclamide.
Other studies  have found that asparagus extracts can lower blood sugar and improve insulin levels in diabetic rats by reducing glucose, cholesterol, and oxidative damage while increasing antioxidant activity.
However, more research is needed to determine which substances in asparagus are responsible for these positive effects, especially in humans.

5. May reduce cholesterol and blood pressure
Bile acids are important in cholesterol metabolism and are linked to diseases like heart disease and cancer.
Researc h has found that asparagus may help reduce cholesterol levels by improving the binding capacity of bile acids during digestion. In fact, asparagus appears to have a significantly higher bile acid-binding capacity than other fresh vegetables like eggplant, mung bean, carrot, and broccoli.
Other  animal studies  have also shown that asparagus may help regulate lipid metabolism, lower cholesterol levels, reduce blood pressure, and promote weight loss in mice. That said, as with the other suggested health benefits of asparagus, more research on humans is necessary.

6. May protect against cancer
Older research has shown that asparagus and its extracts may have some anticancer properties, including for cancers such as  breast cancer  and  pancreatic cancer.
Some of the bioactive compounds asparagus contains, such as saponins or ethanol extracts from the stalk, may have anti-tumor properties or toxicity to certain cancer cells.
Polysaccharides in asparagus  may also hav e anticancer effects by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, promoting healthy digestion and immune function, and inhibiting gene mutation.
That said, the research on asparagus and cancer primarily involved test tube studies, and it’s unclear whether the same effects exist in humans consuming asparagus without additional research.

7. May support immunity
The immune system recognizes and fights off harmful substances and cells.  Research  has shown that asparagus extracts may help boost immunity in various ways, such as improving the activity of red and white blood cells and the production of antibodies.
In addition,  studies  suggest that asparagus spears have some antimicrobial properties, which may help protect against certain infections. For example,  research  has found that films created from asparagus residue appeared to have good antimicrobial properties against the bacteria Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.
That said, more research is needed to fully understand how this works on a molecular level and how this can be applied in humans.

Other potential benefits
Various studies  have suggested that asparagus  may offer  some other health benefits, including:
helping with sleep
reducing stress
supporting epilepsy treatment
improving hormone production
reducing symptoms of colitis
But once again, these findings came from either test tube or animal studies, and it’s unclear whether these benefits extend to humans. That said, it’s not disputable that asparagus is generally a healthy vegetable to add to your diet.

Frequently asked questions
Both broccoli and asparagus are healthy additions to a diet. Asparagus is a little higher in fiber, folate, magnesium, and selenium, whereas  broccoli  is higher in vitamin C.
That said, the difference in their nutrients isn’t that big. Your choice depends on which vegetable is available, which will pair well with your meal, and which one you like best. Generally, eating a variety of vegetables is best for your health.
Asparagus contains many micronutrients, including iron, zinc, and riboflavin. It’s an excellent source of  vitamin K , an essential nutrient  involved  in blood clotting and bone health.
In addition, asparagus is high in  folate (vitamin B9),  a nutrient  vita l for a healthy pregnancy and many important body processes, including cell growth and DNA formation.
You can eat asparagus raw. That said, cooking  may help boost  the antioxidants and nutrients that you get from consuming it.

Takeaway
Asparagus is an excellent vegetable to include in your diet. It’s versatile and can be enjoyed both cooked and raw, either by itself or in soups, stews, salads, and more.
It is low in calories and boasts a high concentration of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that may offer numerous health benefits, such as helping lower blood pressure and cholesterol and helping support immunity.
