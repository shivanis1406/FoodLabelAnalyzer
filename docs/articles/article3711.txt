Healthline’s picks for the best protein powders for men
Price:  $–$$
Dymatize Elite 100% Whey offers a high quality protein blend of whey protein concentrate and isolate.
Whey protein is one of the major milk proteins — the other being casein.
Whey protein contains all the essential amino acids your body needs. It’s particularly rich in leucine, the amino acid that kick-starts the muscle-building process ( 1 ). This makes it a good option for men who want to grow muscle or just maintain what they have.
Dymatize 100% Whey Protein is third-party tested by  Informed Choice  for banned substances and quality assurance.
With more than 15,000 reviews and 4.6 out of 5 stars on Amazon, this protein powder is a popular option among those who prefer to use whey protein.
The product comes in two flavors. You can opt for either a 2-pound (lb.) or 5-lb. tub.
Size:  2- or 5-lb. tub
Protein type:  whey protein concentrate and isolate

Legion Casein+ Protein Powder provides protein in the form of casein, the other major milk protein.
Like whey, casein is a milk-based protein that contains all the essential amino acids your body needs. However, your body digests casein protein much more slowly than it digests whey protein.
Because your body absorbs  casein protein  at a slower rate, it provides your muscles with a steady supply of amino acids over a longer period, usually between 5 and 7 hours ( 2 ).
This makes casein protein particularly useful for promoting muscle growth during periods of fasting, like while you sleep or between meals.
Legion Casein+ Protein Powder is third-party tested to ensure it contains the amounts listed on the label.
It’s only available in one size but comes in multiple flavors, all of which are free of artificial additives and sweeteners.
Size:  2-lb. tub
Protein type:  casein
Available flavors:  Banana Cream Pie, Dutch Chocolate, French Vanilla, Strawberry

A protein powder can be high quality, but it still may not be a great option if it doesn’t taste good.
Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate has you covered in both areas.
It’s a  whey protein isolate , meaning most of the carbs and fats have been removed, leaving behind at least 90% protein by weight.
This makes it a good choice for men who may be following a low calorie diet or who are lactose intolerant.
You can choose from an extensive lineup of flavors that are naturally flavored and sweetened using  stevia .
Reviewers appreciate the wide variety of flavors. They mention this protein powder mixes easily in water without any clumping or residual gritty texture.
Transparent Labs Whey Protein comes in one size. It’s third-party tested for quality and purity.

Although there are some great tasting protein powders and even some flavored like popular breakfast cereals, not everyone desires flavored products.
Besides, the versatility of protein powder extends beyond its traditional use as a shake. You can make protein pancakes, add it to oatmeal, mix it in your morning coffee, and more. So, you may not need or want a protein powder with added flavoring.
Moreover, the sweetness of some protein powders may be too much, making unflavored options a good choice.
The NOW Sports Unflavored Whey Isolate provides 25 grams of high quality whey protein isolate per serving. It’s easy to mix into recipes or your favorite beverage.
This protein powder has almost 2,800 reviews on Amazon and earns 4.5 out of 5 stars.
It’s available in two tub sizes. The powder is  Informed Sport -certified, which means it’s been tested for banned substances.
Size:  1.2- or 5-lb. tubs
Protein type:  whey protein isolate

Whether you have an allergy or intolerance to dairy- or other animal-based protein powders, or you’re following a plant-based diet, there are plenty of high quality, plant-based alternatives available.
Although plant-based protein sources aren’t as easily digested as dairy-based proteins, they can still support muscle building ( 3 ,  4 ).
Garden of Life’s Sport Organic Plant-Based Protein Powder contains a blend of protein from yellow peas, navy beans, lentils, garbanzo beans, and cranberry seeds. This combination ensures you’re getting all the  essential amino acids  needed for building and maintaining muscle.
Each 2-scoop serving of Garden of Life Sport Organic offers at least 20% of the dietary reference intake (DRI) for iron, zinc, and selenium, among others, making it an excellent source of these nutrients.
It also provides a strain of the  probiotic   Bifidobacterium  to support digestive and immune health ( 5 ).
Garden of Life Sports Organic is third-party tested by both  NSF  and  Informed Choice . It’s certified gluten-free and vegan.
It’s offered in two sizes and flavors.
Size:  12 packets or 2-lb. tub
Protein type:  yellow peas, navy beans, lentils, garbanzo beans, and cranberry seeds
Available flavors:  Chocolate and Vanilla

Naked Pea Protein Powder is a high quality product sourced from yellow peas.
Pea protein  is one of the best plant-based alternatives for men who are vegan or have an intolerance or sensitivity to milk proteins because it contains all nine essential amino acids.
It’s also a good option if you have an allergy or sensitivity to other plant-based protein sources, like soy.
Although the milk proteins whey and casein have a better amino acid profile for increasing muscle size and strength, a randomized controlled trial conducted in 2015 found that pea protein leads to similar gains as whey protein ( 6 ).
Naked Pea Protein Powder is third-party certified by  Informed Choice . It’s certified gluten-free and vegan.
It comes in two flavors, and there’s also an unflavored option if you want to use it for baking or incorporate it into something else.
Several reviewers mention they’re able to digest this protein powder well and appreciate that the different flavors taste good without being overpowering when mixed into smoothies and other recipes.
Size:  5-lb. tub
Protein type:  pea protein
Available flavors:  Chocolate, Vanilla, Unflavored
Serving size:  2 scoops (30–38 grams)

If you prefer to prioritize organic ingredients, Natural Force Organic Grass-Fed Whey is a great option.
It’s one of the few quality USDA-certified organic whey protein powders on the market. Plus, it’s also third-party tested to ensure you’re getting the advertised amount of protein per serving without contaminants.
Natural Force sources its whey protein from grass-fed cows. The  milk from grass-fed cows  has been shown to contain more protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and other beneficial nutrients than milk from grain-fed cows ( 7 ).
That said, whey protein is processed to leave behind protein and remove fat. So, while consuming grass-fed rather than grain-fed whey protein powder may offer some added health benefits, these benefits may be minimal.
Along with the use of organic whey protein, Natural Force also uses organic flavors and sweetens the vanilla and cacao varieties with organic  monk fruit . There’s an unflavored option available as well.
This protein powder is also paleo- and keto-certified.
The company claims its packaging uses 70% less plastic than traditional plastic tubs, which makes it a more eco-friendly option.
Size:  1- or 5-lb. packages
Protein type:  organic whey protein concentrate
Available flavors:  Cacao Bean, Vanilla Bean, Unflavored
Serving size:  1 scoop (26–29 grams)
Nutrition facts for 1 serving: Calories:  100–110 Carbs:  2–3 grams Added sugar:  0–<1 gram Protein:  20 grams

Whether to support health, gain confidence, or perform better at a sport, building muscle is a common goal.
Doing so requires that you enter a slight calorie surplus, usually in the range of 200–500 calories, by consuming more calories than you need to maintain your weight ( 8 ).
While you can achieve this surplus from whole foods, sometimes it can be easier to do so with protein supplements, especially if it’s hard to eat enough throughout the day.
However, many protein powders contain fewer than 200 calories per serving, so they’re not the best option for increasing your calories.
The Naked Mass Natural Weight Gainer is a more effective choice for building muscle because it contains a combination of protein and carbohydrates, which increases its calorie content.
Each 4-scoop serving provides 1,250–1,360 calories and 50 grams of whey protein concentrate. While this may be more calories than you need to meet your individual body composition and strength goals, you can always decrease the number of scoops you consume.
Balancing the number of calories you get from food with the calories you’d get from using a protein powder like this one can help you keep your  calorie surplus  in a more moderate range to prevent excess fat gain.
Naked Mass Natural Weight Gainer comes in two flavors. It’s third-party tested by  Informed Choice  for banned substances and quality. Plus, it’s certified gluten-free.
With more than 3,000 reviews, this protein powder receives 4.5 out of 5 stars.
Size:  8-lb. tub
Protein type:  whey protein concentrate
Available flavors:  Chocolate, Vanilla, Unflavored
Serving size:  4 scoops (321–333 grams)

How to choose the best protein powder for your needs
The wide variety of protein powders on the market allows you to be selective in choosing the best one for your needs and goals, but it can be overwhelming at the same time.
Here are some things to keep in mind when choosing the best protein powder for you:
Type:  Protein powders can either be animal- or plant-based. If you don’t have an intolerance or allergy to animal-based protein powder products and don’t avoid them for personal reasons, a quality whey protein concentrate is a great choice.
Flavors:  Some companies use artificial sweeteners and flavors, while others use natural alternatives like stevia or monk fruit. If the latter is important to you, make sure you read the ingredients list to identify whether it contains natural sweeteners and flavors.
Price:  Some protein powders can be relatively inexpensive, while others can be costly. Dairy-based protein powders tend to be less expensive than plant-based alternatives. Protein concentrates are less expensive than isolates.
Other ingredients:  Some protein powders contain other ingredients like creatine or fiber that are intended to support muscle growth or weight management, respectively. If you don’t want or need these additional ingredients, you may be able to save on costs by choosing products without them.
Third-party testing:  Although supplements like protein powders are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), they are not held to the same standards as prescription drugs. As such, it’s best to choose one that is third-party tested to ensure you’re getting what’s on the label and nothing more.

Benefits of using protein powder
Owing to protein’s role in building muscle and strength, many people associate protein powders with bodybuilders and athletes.
However, protein powders are a convenient and effective way to boost anyone’s protein intake to support many avenues of health, regardless of whether you’re looking to put on muscle or training for a sport.
Besides, most people could benefit from consuming more protein than what the current guidelines recommend, which is only the amount needed to prevent a deficiency, not what’s optimal for health ( 9 ).
The benefits of increasing your protein intake include:
Blood sugar management:  Replacing some carbohydrates in your diet with protein can better support healthy blood sugar levels ( 10 ).
Reduced blood pressure:  Some types of protein like milk and soy contain components that have been shown to significantly lower blood pressure ( 11 ,  12 ).
Appetite control:  Protein acts on hormones that suppress appetite, which can be helpful for weight loss ( 13 ).
Improved body composition:  By increasing metabolism and supporting gains in muscle, higher protein intakes combined with resistance training can help you simultaneously build muscle and lose body fat ( 8 ).
Healthy aging:  Older adults who have higher protein intakes experience less muscle loss, are able to maintain better mobility for longer, and have fewer incidents of falls and fractures ( 14 ).
While you certainly don’t need to use protein powder to experience these benefits, they can make it easier to meet your daily protein needs.

Frequently asked questions about protein powder
How often you take protein powder will depend on various factors, including your protein needs, the amount of protein you’re getting from  other sources , and your overall health goals.
However, you can safely take protein powder daily if you choose.
The most common way to use protein powder is by mixing it with water or your favorite beverage. You can also mix it into oatmeal and soups or use it to make protein powder pudding, energy bites, pancakes, and more.
Generally, protein powder lasts 2 years after the manufactured date, regardless of when you open it. The manufactured date is usually stamped on or around the bottom of the tub or package. Some products list the expiration date.

The bottom line
With the variety of protein powders available, choosing the right one for you can be overwhelming.
By reviewing the list of protein powders we’ve selected, we’re hopeful you’ll find one that suits your needs and goals.
Remember, protein powders aren’t a substitute for whole foods, but they can be a convenient and cost-efficient way to help you meet your protein needs.
