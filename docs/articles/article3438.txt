Title: Common Symptoms of Vitamin D Deficiency and How to Treat Them

Symptoms of vitamin D deficiency may include fatigue, frequent illness, anxiety, bone pain, and slower wound healing, among others. Treatments may include dietary changes or taking supplements.
Vitamin D is sometimes called the  sunshine vitamin  because your body makes it from cholesterol when your skin is exposed to sunlight.
It’s a fat-soluble vitamin that plays critical roles in the proper functioning of your body, including  bone health  and immunity. It may even help prevent cancer and protect against several chronic conditions,  including :
bone loss
depression
type 2 diabetes
heart disease
multiple sclerosis
Vitamin D deficiency is typically defined as having blood levels below  20 ng/mL , while levels from 21–29 ng/mL are considered insufficient. Most adults should get  1,500–2,000 international units (IU)  of vitamin D daily.
However, vitamin D deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide. For example, nearly  42%  of adults in the United States have a vitamin D deficiency. This figure rises to almost 63% in Hispanic adults and 82% in African American adults.
Keep reading to learn more about the symptoms and treatments for vitamin D deficiency.

What are the symptoms of vitamin D deficiency?

Frequent illness or infections
Vitamin D  directly interacts  with the cells responsible for addressing infections. If you often become sick, low  vitamin D  levels may be a contributing factor.
Research suggests there’s a link between vitamin D deficiency and respiratory tract infections, such as the  common cold ,  bronchitis , and  pneumonia .
A  2020 review  also found that vitamin D deficiency has been linked to several viral diseases, such as:
hepatitis
flu
COVID-19
AIDS
A  2019 review  of 25 studies found that vitamin D supplementation helped reduce the risk of respiratory tract infections. It was even more beneficial for people with a blood concentration of less than 25 nmol/l, or very low levels of vitamin D.
Vitamin D research has shown that certain levels may help reduce the risks of respiratory infections. However, it’s best to speak with a healthcare professional if you’re experiencing frequent infections or illness without any known cause. They could discuss any supplements and appropriate vaccines for your overall health.

Fatigue and tiredness
Research suggests that vitamin D deficiency may cause  fatigue . For example:
A  2019 study  in 480 older adults linked vitamin D deficiency with fatigue symptoms.
A  2020 study  in 39 children associated low vitamin D levels with poor sleep quality, shorter sleep duration, and delayed bedtimes. These may lead to increased fatigue.
A  2015 study  in female nurses found a connection between low vitamin D levels and self-reported fatigue. What’s more, 89% of the participants were deficient in this vitamin.
Research  suggests that vitamin D supplementation may reduce the severity of fatigue in people with a deficiency.

Bone and back pain
Vitamin D helps maintain bone health by improving your body’s absorption of  calcium . Bone and  lower back pain  may be symptoms of vitamin D deficiency.
A  2018 review  of 81 studies found that people with  arthritis ,  muscle pain , and chronic widespread pain tended to have lower levels of vitamin D than people without these conditions.
Similarly, a  2018 study  in 98 adults with lower back pain linked lower levels of vitamin D to more severe pain. However, a large  2017 review  found that this association was inconsistent across other similar studies.
More studies are necessary.

Anxiety and depression
Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with  anxiety  and  depression , especially in older adults. However, some study results are conflicting and more research is needed.
The effects of  vitamin D supplements  have also been mixed, but some reviews from  2014 ,  2019 , and  2021  have found that they helped relieve symptoms of  depression .

Impaired wound healing
Slow  wound healing  after surgery or injury may be a sign that your vitamin D levels are too low. For example, a  2019 review  found that vitamin D deficiency compromised certain aspects of healing in people who had dental surgery.
This may be because vitamin D  increases  the production of compounds that are crucial for forming new skin as part of the wound-healing process.
Vitamin D’s role in  controlling inflammation  and addressing infections may also be important for proper healing.
For example, a  2014 study  in 221 people found that those with severe vitamin D deficiency were more likely to have higher levels of inflammatory markers that can jeopardize healing.
Similarly, in a  12-week study  involving 60 people with  diabetes-related foot ulcers , those who took vitamin D supplements experienced significant improvements in wound healing compared with the placebo group.
However,  further research  is needed.

Bone loss
Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium absorption and bone metabolism. This is important because taking vitamin D and calcium  at the same time  helps your body maximize absorption.
Low bone mineral density is an indication that your bones have lost calcium and other minerals. This places older adults, especially females, at an  increased risk  of fractures.
Vitamin D deficiency may also  increase your risk  of developing bone diseases like  osteoporosis  and  sarcopenia  (muscle loss).
However, research on vitamin D supplementation therapy in independent older adults has yielded mixed results. For example, a  2021 review  found some benefits, such as reduced muscle pain, while a  2017 review  found that it doesn’t ward off fractures related to bone loss.
Speak with a healthcare professional about vitamin D supplementation if you’re experiencing bone loss.

Hair loss
Research suggests that hair loss may result from  nutrient deficiencies . In particular,  studies  tie low vitamin D levels to  alopecia areata , an autoimmune disease characterized by severe hair loss.
A  2015 study  in 48 people with this condition found that applying a synthetic form of vitamin D topically for 12 weeks significantly increased hair regrowth.
A  2021 review  also found that vitamin D levels may have an inverse relationship with non-scarring hair loss. This means the higher the vitamin D levels, the less hair loss detected in the study, and vice versa.

Muscle pain
The causes of muscle pain are often difficult to pinpoint. However, vitamin D deficiency may be a potential cause.
A 2014 study found that  71%  of people with chronic pain had a deficiency in the vitamin.
The vitamin D receptor is present in nerve cells called nociceptors, which sense pain. This vitamin may also be involved in your body’s  pain signaling pathways , which may play a role in chronic pain.
A  2019 study  found that high dose vitamin D supplements may reduce various types of pain in people with a vitamin D deficiency. Similarly, a 2015 study in 120 children with vitamin D deficiency who had  growing pains  found that a single dose of this vitamin reduced pain scores by an average of  57% .

Weight gain
Obesity is a  risk factor  for vitamin D deficiency.
A  2020 study  in adults found a possible link between low vitamin D status and both belly fat and increased weight, although these effects were more pronounced in males.
That said,  further studies are needed  to determine whether supplementing with this vitamin helps prevent weight gain.

What are the risk factors of vitamin D deficiency?
There’s no single cause for vitamin D deficiency. However, your overall risk may be higher as a result of certain underlying conditions or lifestyle factors,  including :
having darker skin
infants who are breastfeeding
adults age 65 years and older
minimal  sunlight exposure , such as people who live far from the equator or in regions with little sunlight year-round
having  overweight or obesity
having  chronic kidney disease  or  liver disease
having a health condition that affects nutrient absorption, such as  Crohn’s disease  or  celiac disease
using certain medications that affect vitamin D metabolism, such as  statins

How is vitamin D deficiency treated?
Vitamin D deficiency is usually treated with supplements, such as cholecalciferol. You can easily buy these over the counter. However, it’s best to speak with a healthcare professional for the proper dosage recommendations for you.
For a severe deficiency, a doctor may recommend prescription vitamin D, which comes in much stronger doses of up to  50,000 IU . Your doctor may also consider  vitamin D injections .
Magnesium  helps  activate  vitamin D, so you may want to take this mineral too.
Eating more  vitamin D-rich foods  may also boost your levels. Discuss your meal plan with a doctor or nutritionist. Options  include :
fatty fish
egg yolks
fortified cereals
fortified milk and juices
yogurt
beef  liver
A doctor may also recommend you go outside more because  sunlight is a natural source of vitamin D . However, it’s important to take precautions by limiting your total time in the sun and applying sunscreen.

When to see a doctor
It can be difficult to tell whether you have a vitamin D deficiency, as the symptoms may be subtle. Furthermore, it’s possible to have a vitamin D deficiency without experiencing any symptoms.
Ask a doctor to check for vitamin D deficiency if you notice any symptoms. The doctor will do a  25-hydroxy vitamin D blood test  to check for your levels. They may also rule out other causes for some of the symptoms you’re experiencing.

Frequently asked questions
Some ways to help you  increase your vitamin D levels  include getting more sunlight, taking vitamin D supplements, and consuming more fatty fish.
The amount of time required to treat vitamin D deficiency depends on your age, the severity of the deficiency, and any underlying health conditions. A healthcare professional may prescribe adults vitamin D supplements like cholecalciferol for up to  10 weeks , while children may receive a prescription for 12 weeks.

Takeaway
Vitamin D deficiency is surprisingly common, but the symptoms are often subtle and nonspecific, so it may be hard to know whether you have a deficiency or some other health condition.
If you think you may have a deficiency, ask a healthcare professional for a blood test. Vitamin D deficiency is usually treated with supplements and dietary and lifestyle changes.
