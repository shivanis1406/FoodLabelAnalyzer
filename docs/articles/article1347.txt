Title: Can You Flush Out Caffeine? Tips and More

To reduce the effect of caffeine, your best bet is to wait it out and avoid drinking more coffee. You can also help the process along by staying hydrated, exercising, and eating fiber-rich foods.
If you’ve had one too many cups of coffee and are feeling jittery, you may wonder if there’s a way to flush the excess caffeine from your system.
Caffeine is a natural stimulant that millions of people rely on each day. Yet, consuming too much of it may cause side effects like difficulty sleeping, an increased heart rate, jitters, and shakiness ( 1 ,  2 ).
This article explains whether you can flush out caffeine and provides tips for reducing jitters and other uncomfortable effects.

How to reduce caffeine’s effects
Caffeine’s effects are known to last for several hours — and you may have stronger jitters if you drank a lot of coffee, soda,  energy drink , or some other caffeinated beverage ( 3 ).
In fact, once it has entered your body, there’s not much you can do to flush caffeine out. The only way to get rid of it is to wait for it to naturally flush itself.
Nonetheless, you can take a few steps to minimize its  side effects .
If you notice uncomfortable symptoms like shakiness, stop consuming caffeine immediately. Foods and beverages with caffeine include coffee, tea, energy drinks, soda, dark chocolate, and some ice creams and desserts.
Decaf coffee is a good option if you still want to enjoy the flavor and health benefits of coffee. Still, it  contains very low amounts  of caffeine, at 2–7 mg per cup (240 mL) ( 4 ,  5 ).
Furthermore, pay attention to medications, supplements, and personal care products that may harbor caffeine. For example, over-the-counter pain relievers like Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) can pack upwards of 40–60 mg in a single tablet ( 6 ).
Finally, certain performance-enhancing formulas like  pre-workout supplements  may have high amounts of caffeine, with up to 250 mg in just 2 teaspoons (10 grams).
Caffeine’s stimulatory effects are usually noticeable within the first 45 minutes of intake and can last 3–5 hours ( 3 ).
Moreover, the half-life of caffeine is 5 hours, which means the amount of caffeine in your system will take  5 hours to be reduced by half . It will then take another 5 hours to reduce the amount in your blood to 25% ( 3 ).
If you’re worried about  sleep , it’s best to stop consuming caffeine 6–8 hours before bedtime.
Drinking water is important for staying hydrated throughout the day.
Though limited research is available, many anecdotal reports claim that drinking water helps relieve caffeine-induced jitters. This could be because dehydration may make symptoms worse.
Therefore, it may help to  increase your water intake  while you wait for the caffeine to leave your system.
Additionally, if you’re not used to caffeine, it may act as a mild diuretic and lead to  increased urination  and more frequent stools. Though this is rare for those who regularly consume caffeine from coffee or tea, hydrating can help reduce some of these effects ( 7 ,  8 ).
Go for a light walk to  relieve anxiety  and jitters.
If you’re feeling anxious, take slow, deep breaths for 5 minutes. Alternatively,  practice meditation  to calm your mind and nervous system.
Eating may slow the release of caffeine into your bloodstream. Opt for slow-digesting, fiber-rich foods, such as  whole grains , beans, lentils, starchy vegetables, nuts, and seeds ( 1 ).
Though it won’t counteract the stimulatory effects of caffeine,  this amino acid supplement  may help relieve anxiety and reduce blood pressure. Be sure to speak to your healthcare professional before taking it ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ).
Once caffeine is in your system, it’s difficult to get rid of. Avoiding caffeine, staying hydrated, and waiting it out are your best options to reduce its effects.

How much is too much?
Most people can safely consume 400 mg of  caffeine per day  — the equivalent of about 4 cups (945 mL) of coffee ( 12 ).
However, caffeine tolerance varies based on age, genetics, weight, and your liver’s ability to process caffeine. Moreover, certain drugs like  oral contraceptives  and heart medications may increase caffeine’s circulation time in your body ( 13 ).
Pregnant women  should limit themselves to 200 mg per day, as excessive caffeine intake may raise the risk of preterm birth, miscarriage, and low birth weight ( 14 ).
Children should avoid caffeine due to developmental risks, and teenagers should limit their intake ( 15 ,  16 ).
Most people can tolerate up to 400 mg of caffeine per day, or around 4 cups (945 mL) of coffee — though pregnant women, children, and teens should limit their intake.

Risks of excessive caffeine intake
Though caffeine is recognized as safe, everyone tolerates it differently.
It’s important to pay attention to any unwanted side effects, including  headaches , jitters, difficulty sleeping, and increased heart rate. If you experience any of these symptoms, reduce your intake.
Though rare,  caffeine overdose  can occur and is almost always due to the overconsumption of energy drinks and energy shots. Symptoms include ( 17 ):
chest pain
fever
irregular heartbeat
severe dehydration
trouble breathing
uncontrollable muscle movement
vomiting
If you experience any of these symptoms after consuming lots of caffeine, seek medical attention immediately.
Common side effects of caffeine include headaches, jitters, and rapid heart rate. Reduce your intake if you experience any unwanted symptoms. If symptoms worsen or continue, seek medical attention.

The bottom line
Caffeine is an effective, natural way to  boost your energy levels , but many people find they’ve consumed too much and want to flush it from their body.
Side effects of excess caffeine intake include difficulty sleeping, jitters, shakiness, and increased heart rate.
Besides waiting it out and avoiding caffeine, there isn’t any effective  home remedy  to clear caffeine from your system. All the same, you can reduce its side effects by staying hydrated, going for a walk, and eating  fiber-rich foods .
Most people can safely tolerate 400 mg of caffeine per day — about 4 cups (945 mL) of coffee — though your personal limits may vary. Be sure to listen to your body and only consume what feels comfortable.
