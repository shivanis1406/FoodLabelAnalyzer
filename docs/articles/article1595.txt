Regardless of age, staying active is important for overall health.
After all, physical activity can help prevent health conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. It can also improve sleep and reduce the risk of depression and anxiety ( 1 ,  2 ).
Regular exercise is particularly important for older adults, as reduced physical activity is a contributing factor in the loss of strength and stamina that comes with aging ( 3 ).
Plus, staying physically active as you age can help maintain your independence and reduce your risk of injury from falls ( 4 ,  5 ).
For adults 65 years of age or older, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends at least 2 days per week of strength training, plus one of the following cardio activities ( 5 ):
150 minutes of moderate intensity activity, such as brisk walking
75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity, such as jogging or running
an equivalent mix of moderate and vigorous activity
In order to meet these recommendations, it can be helpful to have gym equipment at home.

Healthline’s picks of the best home workout equipment for older adults
Biking  is a great way to build lower body strength and get your heart rate up.
Indoor bikes are available in a range of styles, including upright and recumbent.
While upright bikes offer a more traditional exercise bike experience,  recumbent styles  help take some of the pressure off your joints and may be more comfortable if you experience limited mobility or joint pain.
Below are our picks for the best exercise bikes for older adults.
Price:  $$
Warranty:  optional 2-year protection plan for $24.99
Weight:  66 pounds (29.9 kg)
Max user weight:  300 pounds (136.1 kg)
Dimensions:  19.3 × 53.5 × 39 inches (49 × 135.9 × 99.1 cm)
The JEKEE Recumbent Exercise Bike is ideal if getting on and off an upright bike is difficult or uncomfortable for you.
The bike has a large cushioned seat that’s adjustable and designed to help take some of the pressure off your back while riding. Meanwhile, the pedals feature adjustable straps to keep your feet secure throughout your workout.
Other notable features include eight levels of resistance, heart rate sensors on the handles, and an LCD console, which displays your time, distance, speed, heart rate, and  calories burned .
While it doesn’t have a touch screen, the bike offers a device holder, allowing you to stream workout classes or TV shows using your own tablet or smartphone.
Additionally, the bike is relatively light and equipped with transport wheels, making it easy to move.
However, assembling it isn’t quite as easy, so you may want to consider paying for professional assembly.
Overall, reviews are positive, with many customers mentioning that the bike is affordable, comfortable, easy to get on and off of, and great for a  low-impact workout .
On the other hand, some users are less than thrilled by the company’s customer service team. Reviewers also note that while the bike is advertised as suitable for varying heights, it may still be too big for shorter individuals.
Price:  $$
Warranty:  90-day
Weight:  45 pounds (20.4 kg)
Max user weight:  300 pounds (136.1 kg)
Dimensions: Folded:  23 × 20 × 49 inches (58.4 × 50.8 × 124.5 cm) Upright:  29 × 20 × 44 inches (73.7 × 50.8 × 111.8 cm) Recumbent:  32 × 20 × 41 inches (81.3 × 50.8 × 104.1 cm)

Recumbent:  32 × 20 × 41 inches (81.3 × 50.8 × 104.1 cm)
The LANOS 2-in-1 Folding Exercise Bike provides the unique option of having both an upright and recumbent bike in one machine.
Because of this, the upright bike version includes a backrest, which is a bonus if you need the extra support.
What’s more, the bike can be folded and stored, making it suitable for smaller spaces. It’s also relatively light, allowing you to move it to another area in your home if needed.
With 10 levels of resistance, all fitness levels can enjoy a workout on this machine.
As with the JEKEE above, the LANOS 2-in-1 includes  heart rate  sensors on the handlebars, a device holder, and an LCD screen for monitoring your performance metrics, such as speed, distance, time, heart rate, and calories burned.
According to the company, no tools are required for assembly, and the whole process should only take about 30 minutes. User reviews back this claim, mentioning that setting up the bike is quick and simple.
Overall, customers are satisfied with their purchase, though some complain of a loud knocking sound when the machine is in use.
While the bike is affordable, it’s important to note that it only comes with a 90-day warranty.
Treadmills  offer a convenient way to get in a cardio workout, especially when getting outside isn’t an option.
Depending on your fitness goals and ability, you can opt for a simple walking treadmill, or one with a few extra bells and whistles.
Keep in mind, running is considered a high-impact activity that may not be appropriate for all fitness levels.
Here are our top picks for the best treadmills for older adults.
Price:  $$$$
Warranty:  10-year parts, 2-year labor
Weight:  386 pounds (175.1 kg)
Max user weight:  400 pounds (181.4 kg)
Dimensions:  84 × 35.5 × 58 inches (213.4 × 90.2 × 147.3 cm)
The 3G Cardio Elite Runner Treadmill is a sturdy, heavy-duty option for more advanced walkers and  runners .
It also includes a low deck height of 7.5 inches (19.1 cm), as well as an orthopedic belt, making it suitable for those with limited mobility as well.
Speeds reach up to 12 mph (19.3 kph), and the incline can be adjusted from 0–15%, providing plenty of training options for individuals of varying fitness levels.
The treadmill includes preprogrammed workouts, fitness tests to assess  your progress , and an option to create your own workouts, though some user reviews mention that doing so is a bit tricky.
The digital display shows speed, time, distance, calories burned, and heart rate, which is taken from the pulse sensors built into the handlebars.
Overall, this treadmill is a well-built, versatile machine. However, it’s also expensive and doesn’t offer an integrated touch screen for streaming classes, which may be a downside for some.
Additionally, because it’s so big and heavy, it may be worth paying extra for professional assembly.
Overall, reviews are positive and some mention that the customer service is great. While the treadmill is expensive, most reviewers feel that it’s well worth the cost.
Price:  $$$
Warranty:  180-day parts, 2-year frame, optional 2-year protection plan for $44.99 through Amazon
Weight:  123 pounds (55.8 kg)
Max user weight:  295 pounds (133.8 kg)
Dimensions:  58 × 29 × 53 inches (147.3 × 73.7 × 134.6 cm)
If you’re interested in a  walking  treadmill, this option from Sunny Health & Fitness is one of the best.
The machine features extensive, multi-grip rails, making it great if you have limited mobility or balance. Plus, it has a low deck height, making stepping on and off the treadmill easier.
The digital monitor displays calories, distance, time, and speed throughout your workout. However, unlike the treadmill listed above, this one doesn’t include heart rate sensors.
This treadmill also doesn’t allow for incline, so if you’re looking for a workout that includes hills, this isn’t the machine for you.
That being said, it’s a great option if you prefer  walking over running . It may also be a good choice if you’re recovering from an injury, though it’s important to clear any activity with your doctor or physical therapist first.
Compared with the first treadmill on the list, this machine is much more affordable, smaller, and lighter. It even comes with transport wheels on the front so that you can move it if needed.
Just keep in mind that as the max speed is capped at 5 mph (8 kph), it can only be used for walking and light jogging.
Overall, user reviews are positive. However, some customers find it challenging to set up, so you may want to pay for expert assembly.
Ellipticals  are another great way to get in an effective, low-impact cardio workout.
An elliptical machine works by standing on pedals and using a gliding motion to move your legs back and forth. Some also include moving handles to engage your upper body as well.
As a result,  compared with a treadmill , an elliptical is a better option if you’re prone to knee injuries or have joint pain.
Below are our picks for the best ellipticals for older adults.
Price:  $$$$
Warranty:  lifetime motor and frame, 5-year electronics and parts, 2-year labor
Weight:  230 pounds (170.1 kg)
Max user weight:  375 pounds (133.8 kg)
Dimensions:  26 × 58 × 83 inches (68.6 cm × 147.3 cm × 210.8 cm)
The  Sole Fitness E35 Elliptical Machine  has unique, oversized pedals that slope slightly inward, which, according to the company, helps reduce the strain on your ankles, knees, and hips.
While it doesn’t offer many of the high-tech features as other ellipticals, the E35 is built with a durable frame and includes programmed workouts for all fitness levels.
To keep you  motivated while you sweat , you can listen to music or podcasts through the machine’s Bluetooth-enabled speakers or by plugging your device into the USB port.
The elliptical also features a tablet holder, cooling fans, heart rate sensors on the handlebars, and a chest strap for more accurate heart rate data.
Most user reviews are positive, with customers frequently mentioning the machine’s extensive warranty and sturdy, heavy-duty frame.
However, because of its size, the E35 may be difficult to assemble.
According to the website, professional assembly is temporarily unavailable, so you may want to enlist a friend to help you set it up.
Finally, while it isn’t cheap, Sole Fitness offers special financing options for qualified customers.
Price:  $$$
Warranty:  2 years
Weight:  110 pounds (49.9 kg)
Max user weight:  300 pounds (136.1 kg)
Dimensions:  54 × 38 × 52.5 inches (137.2 × 96.5 × 133.4 cm)
Designed specifically for people with joint issues or those recovering from hip or  knee surgery , the Teeter FreeStep LT3 Recumbent Cross Trainer combines the support of a recumbent bike with the movement of an elliptical.
For optimal comfort, the seat is adjustable and offers three reclining positions, while the handlebars are also adjustable to accommodate users of varying heights.
Another unique feature is the movement pattern of the pedals.
Rather than a circular or long gliding motion, the pedals move more vertically, similar to a stepper machine.
As a result, the FreeStep helps prevent your knees from traveling over your toes and keeps your hips stable, making the movement more comfortable if you have joint pain or limited mobility.
The trainer also includes three levels of resistance, a tablet holder, and a small digital display for monitoring your time, distance, speed, and calories burned.
However, there are a few potential downsides to consider, including difficult assembly and a high price tag.
With that said, special financing options are available, and the elliptical is eligible to be paid for using a  health savings account (HSA)  or flexible spending account (FSA).
Strength training  offers many benefits for adults of all ages, but it’s particularly important for maintaining muscle mass and supporting everyday activities, like carrying groceries.
The CDC recommends getting at least 2 days of strength training in per week. Below are two great options for helping you reach this recommendation ( 5 ).
Price:  $$
Warranty:  2-year
Weight : 105 pounds (47.6 kg)
Dimensions:  15.75 × 8 × 9 inches (40 × 20.3 × 22.9 cm) per dumbbell
Adjustable dumbbells are great if you’re short on space, as they offer multiple sets of weights in one compact device.
The  Bowflex SelectTech 552  is a particularly good option, as it replaces 15 pairs of weights and allows you to easily adjust the weight using a simple dial mechanism.
The dumbbells include weight loads ranging from 5 pounds (2.3 kg) up to 52.5 pounds (23.8 kg), which allows you to  progress in weight  without needing to purchase a new set of dumbbells.
While the SelectTech 552 may seem expensive, it’s relatively affordable if you consider purchasing 15 pairs of dumbbells separately.
Despite its convenience, this adjustable dumbbell set is bulkier than traditional dumbbells and may be a bit awkward to hold during certain  exercises .
Still, the reviews are overall positive, with customers noting how easy the dumbbells are to use.
Depending on your range of motion, you may want to consider purchasing an elevated dumbbell rack to avoiding having to bend down to pick them up.
Additionally, you may also want to purchase an exercise mat or  weight bench  to allow for greater variety in your workout.
Price:  $
Warranty:  none
Weight : 2.45 pounds (1.1 kg)
Dimensions:  7.9 × 6.7 × 4.3 inches (20.1 × 17 × 10.9 cm)
Resistance bands are a great alternative to free weights, as they take up less space and are easy to transport.
While there are  several types of resistance bands  to choose from, this set from Whatafit is one of the best for strength training.
The whole set weighs just over 2 pounds (1 kg), but can still provide just as much, or more, resistance as free weights.
This set includes 5 bands, with 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 pound (4.5, 9.1, 13.6, 18.1, 22.7 kg) resistance equivalents. You can also stack multiple bands to have up to 150 pounds (68 kg) of resistance.
In addition to the bands, your purchase comes with the following accessories:
handle attachments
door attachments
ankle straps
travel bag
manual with  example exercises
Overall, reviews are positive, and individuals appreciate the affordability and versatility of these bands. While the set is relatively affordable, it doesn’t come with a warranty or guarantee.
Balance and mobility  become increasingly important as we age. Research has shown that in addition to cardio and strength training, balance exercises help reduce the risk of falls and improve mobility in older adults ( 6 ).
Here are our picks of the best home equipment for balance and stability workouts.
Price:  $
Warranty:  none
Weight : 3 pounds (1.4 kg)
Dimensions:  64 × 24 inches (162.6 × 61 cm)
A  yoga mat  is a great addition to any home gym, as it can be used for a variety of workouts, such as yoga, strength training, Pilates, and stretching.
At 6 mm, this particular mat is extra thick, making it more comfortable than other mats, especially on hard surfaces.
Additionally, the nonslip texture makes it easier to stay steady in yoga poses, though some users complain that it gets slick during sweaty workouts.
According to other reviews, washing the mat before the first use helps remove the slip, and if you still have trouble, you can always purchase a yoga towel for extra grip.
The Gaiam Premium Yoga Mat is available in a variety of colors and prints to suit your style. Plus, the company offers an extra-long version for taller individuals.
As a bonus, a free, downloadable  yoga workout  comes with the purchase of this mat.
Overall, the Gaiam Premium Yoga Mat is affordable and comfortable, making it a great pick for any type of floor exercise.

A Bosu ball is similar to an exercise ball, but with a flat surface on one side for added stability.
As a result, it’s super helpful to have on hand for balance exercises.
The Bosu ball can be used for a  variety of balance and strength exercises , including bird dogs, pushups, and crunches.
Your purchase also includes a downloadable manual with instructions and sample workouts.
The Bosu Balance Trainer is available in a variety of colors and has mostly positive reviews online, though some users complain that it loses air and needs to be pumped up again more frequently than they would like.
A pump is also included in the box to make it easy to reinflate as needed.

How to choose the best home workout equipment
When purchasing home exercise equipment, there are several factors to consider, including your  workout goals , available space, and desired budget.
When shopping for workout gear, it’s important to think about the kinds of exercises that you enjoy, as well as the type of equipment that best fits your fitness and mobility level.
When shopping for a cardio machine, a few factors to consider include whether you want to be upright, as in walking or jogging on a treadmill, or if you prefer a seated experience, such as a  bike  or recumbent elliptical.
Meanwhile, for strength training, resistance bands and  dumbbells  are great options for building and maintaining muscle mass.
While resistance bands are lighter and often provide the same level of resistance as dumbbells, some exercises are easier to perform with free weights.
Finally, for balance and stability workouts, Bosu balls and yoga mats are both great options. Plus, they’re relatively affordable and can be used for strength training and cardio exercises, too.
As some gym equipment takes up more space than others, you’ll want to measure your desired workout areas to ensure that your purchase fits.
If space is limited, a yoga mat is a great option, as it supports a wide variety of strength, balance, and cardio workouts. You may also want to consider a  folding cardio machine , like the LANOS 2-in-1 Folding Exercise Bike.
Of course, you’ll also want to decide how much you’re willing to spend on exercise equipment.
While some people prefer the high-tech features of more expensive cardio machines, it’s important to keep in mind that you don’t need to buy expensive equipment to stay in shape.
In fact, it’s possible to get an effective workout in using just your  body weight .

The bottom line
Staying active as you age can help prevent certain health conditions, reduce your risk of falls, and maintain your independence.
As they each offer their own benefits, be sure to include cardio, strength training, and balance exercises in your weekly routine.
With seemingly endless options of equipment available for home workouts, how you choose to stay active is up to you. However, it’s always a good idea to check with a healthcare professional before incorporating anything new into your routine.
