Title: 8 Proven Health Benefits of Dates

Dates are high in fiber and antioxidants. Their nutritional benefits may support brain health and prevent disease.
Dates are the fruit of the date palm tree, which is grown in many tropical regions of the world. Dates have become quite popular in recent years.
Almost all dates sold in Western countries are dried.
You can tell whether or not  dates  are dried based on their appearance. Wrinkled skin indicates they are dried, whereas smooth skin indicates freshness.
Depending on the variety, fresh dates are fairly small in size and range in color from bright red to bright yellow. Commonly consumed varieties include Medjool and Deglet Noor dates.
Dates are chewy with a sweet flavor. They are also high in some important nutrients and have a variety of advantages and uses.
This article will discuss 8 health benefits of eating dates and how to incorporate them into your diet.

1. Very nutritious
Dates have an excellent nutrition profile.
Since they’re dried, their calorie content is higher than most fresh fruit. The calorie content of dates is similar to that of other  dried fruits , such as raisins and figs ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
Most of the calories in dates come from carbs. The rest are from a very small amount of protein. Despite their calories, dates contain some important vitamins and minerals in addition to a significant amount of fiber.
A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of Medjool dates provides the following nutrients ( 1 ):
Calories:  277
Carbs:  75 grams
Fiber:  7 grams
Protein:  2 grams
Potassium:  15% DV
Magnesium : 13% DV
Copper:  40% DV
Manganese:  13% DV
Iron:  5% DV
Vitamin B6:  15% DV
Dates are also high in antioxidants, which may contribute to many of their health benefits ( 4 ).
Dates contain several vitamins and minerals, in addition to fiber and antioxidants. However, they are high in calories since they are dried fruit.

2. High in fiber
Getting enough fiber is important for your overall health.
With almost 7 grams of fiber in a 3.5-ounce serving, including dates in your diet is a great way to  increase your fiber intake  ( 1 ).
Fiber can benefit your digestive health by preventing constipation. It promotes regular bowel movements by contributing to the formation of stool ( 5 ).
In one study, 21 people who consumed 7 dates per day for 21 days experienced improvements in stool frequency and had a significant increase in bowel movements compared to when they did not eat dates ( 6 ).
Furthermore, the fiber in dates may be beneficial for blood sugar control. Fiber slows digestion and may help prevent blood sugar levels from spiking too high after eating ( 7 ).
For this reason, dates have a low glycemic index (GI), which measures how quickly your blood sugar rises after eating a certain food ( 8 ).
Dates are high in fiber, which may be beneficial for preventing constipation and controlling blood sugar.

3. High in disease-fighting antioxidants
Dates provide various antioxidants that have a number of health benefits, including a reduced risk of several diseases.
Antioxidants  protect your cells from free radicals, which are unstable molecules that may cause harmful reactions in your body and lead to disease ( 9 ).
Compared to similar types of  fruit , such as figs and dried plums, dates appear to have the highest antioxidant content ( 10 ).
Here’s an overview of the three most potent antioxidants in dates:
Flavonoids:   Flavonoids  are powerful antioxidants that may help reduce inflammation and have been studied for their potential to reduce the risk of diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and certain types of cancer ( 11 ,  12 ,  13 ).
Carotenoids:   Carotenoids  are proven to promote heart health and may also reduce the risk of eye-related disorders, such as macular degeneration ( 14 ).
Phenolic acid:  Known for their anti-inflammatory properties, phenolic acids may help lower the risk of cancer and  heart disease  ( 4 ,  15 ).
Dates contain several types of antioxidants that may help prevent the development of certain chronic illnesses, such as heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes.

4. May promote brain health
Eating dates may help improve  brain function .
Laboratory studies have found dates to be helpful for lowering inflammatory markers, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), in the brain. High levels of IL-6 are associated with a higher risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s ( 16 ,  17 ,  18 ).
Additionally, other studies including animal studies have shown dates to be helpful for reducing the activity of amyloid beta proteins, which can form plaques in the brain ( 17 ).
When plaques accumulate in the brain, they may disturb communication between brain cells, which can ultimately lead to brain cell death and  Alzheimer’s disease  ( 18 ).
One animal study found that mice fed food mixed with dates had significantly better memory and learning ability, as well as less anxiety-related behaviors, compared to those that did not eat them ( 19 ).
The potential brain-boosting properties of dates have been attributed to their content of antioxidants known to  reduce inflammation , including flavonoids ( 17 ).
However, more human studies are needed to confirm the role of dates in brain health.
Dates may be helpful for lowering inflammation and preventing plaques from forming in the brain, which may be important for preventing Alzheimer’s disease.

5. May promote natural labor
Dates have been studied for their potential to promote and ease late-term labor in pregnant people.
Eating these fruits throughout the last few weeks of pregnancy may promote cervical dilation and lower the need for induced  labor . They may also be helpful in reducing labor time ( 20 ).
An older meta-analysis from 2011 looking at studies where pregnant people took dates prior to their due date found those who ate dates were in labor for less time than those who did not eat them, but also notes that the link between eating dates and a faster delivery needs to be researched further ( 21 ).
A 2017 study of 154 pregnant people found that those who ate dates were much less likely to be induced compared to those who did not ( 22 ).
A third study found similar results in 91 pregnant people who consumed 70–76 grams of dates daily starting the 37th week of pregnancy. They were in active labor for an average of 4 fewer hours than those who did not eat dates ( 20 ).
Although eating dates appears to help promote labor and reduce labor duration, more research is needed to confirm these effects.
The role dates may have in  pregnancy  is likely due to compounds that bind to oxytocin receptors and appear to mimic the effects of oxytocin in the body. Oxytocin is a hormone that causes labor contractions during childbirth ( 23 ).
Additionally, dates contain tannins, which are compounds that have been shown to help facilitate contractions. They are also a good source of natural sugar and calories, which are necessary to maintain energy levels during labor ( 23 ).
Dates may promote and ease natural labor for pregnant people when consumed during the last few weeks of pregnancy.

6. Natural sweetener
Dates are a source of fructose, which is a natural type of sugar found in fruit ( 1 ).
For this reason, dates are very sweet and also have a subtle caramel-like taste. They make a great  healthy substitute for white sugar  in recipes due to the nutrients, fiber, and antioxidants that they provide.
The best way to substitute dates for white sugar is to make date paste, as in  this  recipe. It is made by mixing dates with water in a blender. A rule of thumb is to replace sugar with date paste at a 1:1 ratio.
For example, if the recipe calls for 1 cup of sugar, you’ll replace it with 1 cup of date paste.
It is important to note that although dates are high in fiber and nutrients, they are still fairly high in calories and best consumed in moderation.
Dates are a healthy substitute for white sugar in recipes due to their sweet taste, nutrients, fiber and antioxidants.

7. Other potential health benefits
People claim dates have a few other health benefits that have not yet been extensively studied.
Bone health:  Dates contain several minerals, including phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium. All of these have been studied for their potential to prevent bone-related conditions like osteoporosis ( 1 ,  23 ).
Blood sugar control:  Dates have the potential to help with  blood sugar regulation  due to their low glycemic index, fiber, and antioxidants. Thus, eating them may support diabetes management ( 25 ,  26 ).
Although these potential health benefits are promising, more human studies are needed before conclusions can be made.
Some claim dates promote bone health and aid in blood sugar control, but these effects have not been studied sufficiently.

8. Easy to add to your diet
Dates are incredibly versatile and make a delicious snack. They are often paired with other foods, such as  almonds ,  nut butter , or soft cheese.
Dates are also very sticky, which makes them useful as a binder in baked goods, such as cookies and bars. You can also combine dates with nuts and seeds to make healthy snack bars or energy balls, as in  this  recipe.
What’s more, you can use dates to sweeten up sauces, such as salad dressings and marinades, or blend them into smoothies and oatmeal.
It is important to note that dates are high in calories and their sweet taste makes them easy to overeat. For this reason, they are best consumed in moderation.
There are many different ways to eat dates. They are commonly eaten plain but can also be incorporated into other popular dishes.

The bottom line
Dates are a healthy fruit to include in your diet.
They are high in several nutrients,  fiber , and antioxidants, all of which may provide health benefits ranging from improved digestion to a reduced risk of disease.
There are several ways to add dates to your diet. One popular way to eat them is as a natural sweetener in various dishes. They also make a great snack.
It’s easiest to find dates in their dried form, though these are higher in calories than fresh fruit so it is important to eat them in moderation.
Dates are definitely worth adding to your diet, as they are both nutritious and delicious.
Try to add dates to one meal or snack this week. If you enjoy the addition, consider adding it to more meals and snacks moving forward.
