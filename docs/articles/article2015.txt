Title: What Is a Zero-Carb Diet, and What Foods Can You Eat?

A no-carb diet may provide certain benefits, including lowering blood pressure. But this diet can also cause side effects and may be difficult to sustain.
A no-carb diet is an extreme version of low carb dieting. It eliminates almost all carbs, including whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.
While studies show that decreasing your carb intake can help you shed pounds and may have health benefits, completely eliminating carbs is highly restrictive and most likely unnecessary.
This article provides a detailed overview of a no-carb diet, including its potential benefits, downsides, and foods to eat and avoid.

What is a no-carb diet?
A no-carb diet is a way of eating that eliminates digestible carbs as much as possible.
Carbs are your body’s primary source of energy. They’re found in grains, beans, legumes, fruits, vegetables, milk, yogurt, pasta, bread, and baked goods.
Therefore, someone on a no-carb diet must avoid most of these foods and instead eat foods that contain primarily protein or fat, such as meats, fish, eggs, cheese, oils, and butter.
There is no strict rubric for a no-carb diet. Some people who follow it eat nuts and seeds,  non-starchy vegetables , and high fat fruits like avocado and coconut.
Even though these foods have some carbs, they’re  high in fiber.  Therefore, they have only a minuscule number of digestible or net carbs, which is calculated by subtracting the amount of fiber from the total number of carbs.
A no-carb diet resembles a  ketogenic diet , which limits your carb intake to fewer than  20-50 grams (g) per day  and encourages you to get about 60% or more of your daily calories from fat.
Depending on what you choose to eat, a no-carb diet can be more restrictive than keto.

How to follow a no-carb diet
Simply put, when you follow a no-carb diet, you avoid all high carb foods.
Specifically, try to eliminate whole and refined grains, baked goods, fruits, milk, yogurt, beans, legumes, pasta, bread, sugar-sweetened beverages, and starchy vegetables like peas and corn.
Food and drinks allowed on a no-carb diet include meat, fish, eggs, cheese, butter, oils, water, and plain coffee or tea.
If you’re less stringent, you can also eat nuts, seeds, non-starchy vegetables, and high fat fruits like avocado and coconut since these foods are low in  net carbs .
Since this diet focuses on restricting a specific macronutrient, there are no recommendations for daily calorie intake or  portion sizes .

Can you lose weight by not eating carbs?
In general, reducing your carb intake can help you lose weight.
Replacing carbs with primarily more protein, as wellas fiber and fat,  may help  you feel more full and eat fewer overall calories, which in turn promotes  weight loss .
The  research  is still mixed on whether reducing your carb intake is better for weight loss and health. Some studies have suggested this to be the case in the first 6 months but not as much in the long term.
Therefore, you likely don’t need to completely eliminate carbs to achieve weight loss. Gradually reducing your carb intake and, more importantly, decreasing your  overall calorie intake  are less restrictive ways to lose weight.
Very low carb diets typically promote rapid weight loss in the first few weeks.
However, this is usually due to a quick drop in water weight because every gram of carbs holds approximately  3 g  of water in your body.

Other benefits of a no-carb diet
No studies exist on diets that completely eliminate carbs, but research on very low-carb and ketogenic diets suggests that they may have several benefits.
Cardiovascular health:  Decreasing your carb intake may improve  heart health . Very low carb diets have been shown to  decrease  blood  triglyceride levels , which can increase your chance of heart disease. Even so, more research is needed.
Blood glucose:  Cutting carbs — particularly refined carbs and sugar — can aid blood sugar control, which may be  especially helpful  for people with diabetes.
Blood pressure : Some  studies suggest  reducing  carb intake  can help lower blood pressure.
Reduction of belly fat : Limited  research  indicates that very-low-carb diets are better than low fat diets at decreasing  belly fat , a type of fat associated with inflammation and certain diseases.
Metabolic syndrome : Decreasing carb intake  is linked with  a lower chance of metabolic syndrome, a group of risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing heart disease, diabetes, and stroke.

Downsides of a no-carb diet
A no-carb diet may have a number of downsides.
Constipation:  Since a no-carb diet restricts fruits, most vegetables, beans, and whole grains, it can be very low in fiber, which helps digestion by helping maintain bowel regularity. Because of this, a no-carb diet  may lead  to  constipation .
Low energy:  Carbs are your body’s primary source of energy. Therefore, a no-carb diet may lead to low energy and  fatigue .
Insufficient nutrients:  A no-carb diet may not provide enough  vitamins and minerals , such as potassium, B vitamins, and vitamin C, which are abundant in fruits, vegetables, and other plant foods. Additionally, the increased urination that results from restricting carbs  may lead  to nutrient deficiencies such as sodium and  potassium  over time.
If you’re following a diet that still allows foods very low in net carbs, then you’re basically following a variation of the ketogenic diet.  Research  shows that as long as you’re getting all the necessary nutrients, you should be able to remain healthy long-term.
On the other hand, if you’re excluding carbs entirely, the long-term impact isn’t as clear.  Research  suggests that eating only animal proteins, for example, causes few negative side effects, though some people did develop higher Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) or bad cholesterol levels.
Excluding carbs doesn’t necessarily mean excluding all plant foods. However, the research on this subject is limited. Another  2020 study  only examined whether it is possible to survive by only eating animal proteins. The authors concluded that your calcium may become compromised over time, among other possible adverse effects.
In short, you are likely to survive without carbs in the sense that you won’t starve to death, but it’s unclear what the long-term health consequences might be.
As the no-carb diet is highly restrictive, very  high in fat , and not well researched for safety, it’s not appropriate for those with eating disorders, children, cholesterol hyper-responders, and  pregnant  or nursing people.
Due to a lack of sufficient  research , it’s a good idea to consult with your doctor and to be monitored by a healthcare professional as long as you are excluding carbs from your diet.

What should you eat on a no carb diet?

The bottom line
A no-carb diet eliminates almost all carbs and encourages high intakes of fat and  protein .
It may boost weight loss, heart health, and blood sugar control. Yet, it’s unnecessary to cut all carbs to experience these benefits.
Plus, this diet may  reduce energy levels  and increase your risk of nutrient deficiencies.
Instead, aim to eat a balanced diet with a variety of foods.
