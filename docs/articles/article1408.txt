Title: 6 Surprising Benefits of Lucuma Powder

Lucuma is the fruit of the  Pouteria lucuma  tree native to South America.
It has a hard, green outer shell and soft, yellow flesh with a dry texture and sweet flavor that’s often likened to a mix of sweet potato and butterscotch.
Nicknamed the “gold of the Incas,” lucuma has been used as a traditional remedy in South America for centuries.
It’s most commonly found in powder supplement form and touted for its many potential health benefits.
What’s more, due to its sweet taste, it’s used as a healthier alternative to table sugar and other popular sweeteners.
Here are 6 surprising benefits of lucuma powder.

1. More nutritious than most sweeteners
Lucuma can be eaten raw but is most commonly found in a dried, powdered supplement form that’s often used as a natural sweetener.
One tablespoon  (8 grams) of lucuma powder provides:
Calories:  30
Protein:  1 gram
Fat:  0 grams
Carbs:  6 grams
Sugars:  3 grams
Fiber:  2 grams
Lucuma contains less sugar but more nutrients than table sugar.
Lucuma powder also offers a relatively good amount of both  soluble and insoluble fiber , unlike most other common sweeteners, such as table sugar.
Insoluble fiber adds bulk to your stool and prevents constipation by helping food move smoothly through your gut.
Soluble fiber feeds your  beneficial gut bacteria , which, in turn, produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These are then used as food by cells in your gut, keeping them healthy.
These short-chain fats also protect against inflammation and improve symptoms of gut disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),  Crohn’s disease , and ulcerative colitis.
One tablespoon (8 grams) of lucuma powder also provides some calcium, iron, potassium, niacin, and vitamin C — though these amounts generally cover less than 1% of the Daily Value (DV). Still, it’s more nutritious than other popular sweeteners.

2. Contains a variety of antioxidants
Lucuma contains a variety of antioxidants, which are powerful compounds that help protect your cells from damage caused by highly reactive molecules called free radicals.
Consuming a diet  rich in antioxidants  may help protect against health conditions like heart disease and certain cancers.
For instance,  research  shows that lucuma is particularly rich in polyphenols and carotenoids, two groups of antioxidants known for their anti-inflammatory, cancer-fighting, and heart-health-promoting properties.
It’s  especially high  in xanthophylls, a group of carotenoids responsible for lucuma’s yellow color that’s thought to promote eye health and good vision.
Lucuma is  also packed  with  vitamin C , a nutrient with antioxidant properties that plays many important roles in your body, such as supporting vision, a strong immune system, and heart health.
Additionally, the polyphenols in lucuma are thought to offer strong protection against chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease.
However, research on the specific types of antioxidants in lucuma is limited, and more studies are needed to fully understand the potential antioxidant benefits of this fruit.

3. May benefit blood sugar control
Despite being rich in carbs, lucuma may offer some protection against type 2 diabetes.
In part, this may be because most of its carbs are complex. Carbs can be split into three categories:
Sugars.  These are short-chain types of carbs found in many foods. Examples include glucose, fructose, and lactose. They’re quickly digested and can lead to spikes in your blood sugar levels.
Starches.  These are longer chains of sugars that get broken down into sugars in your gut. They take longer to digest and are less likely to spike blood sugar levels drastically.
Fiber.  This is a type of nondigestible carb that’s broken down and used as food by beneficial gut bacteria. It helps maintain stable blood sugar levels.
Sugars are considered simple carbs, while starches and fiber are thought of as complex. Complex carbs, such as the starches and fiber making up most of the carbs in lucuma, have been shown to promote healthy  blood sugar levels .
What’s more, the soluble fiber in lucuma may protect against diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity and preventing blood sugar spikes after a meal or snack.
Moreover,  test-tube   research  shows that the blood-sugar-lowering mechanisms of lucuma may be comparable to those of certain antidiabetic drugs.
It prevents the action of the alpha-glucosidase enzyme, which is responsible for breaking down complex carbs into simple sugars that tend to  spike blood sugar  levels.
Lucuma is often claimed to have a low glycemic index (GI), which means that it would raise blood sugar levels to a much lower extent than other sweeteners like pure sugar.
If true, this would be another reason why lucuma may benefit blood sugar control. However, no studies have confirmed lucuma’s low GI score. As with all sweeteners, it’s likely best consumed in moderation.
Overall, more research is needed on the potential beneficial effects of lucuma on blood sugar control.

4. May promote heart health
Lucuma may offer some protection against heart disease, likely due to its polyphenol content.
Polyphenols are beneficial plant compounds  thought to protect  against high blood pressure and heart disease.
One  test-tube study  found that lucuma may prevent the action of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), which is involved in regulating your blood pressure.
By doing so, lucuma may help lower blood pressure.
Though preliminary results seem promising, research is lacking, and more studies are needed to confirm these  heart health benefits  in humans.

5. Can be used for baking or desserts
Lucuma powder can be used as a substitute for sugar in pies, cakes, and other desserts or baked goods.
Lucuma’s texture is comparable to granulated sugar, but its taste is more similar to that of brown sugar.
You can use a 1:2 ratio by volume to  substitute brown sugar  for lucuma. For instance, use 1 cup (120 grams) of lucuma for each 1/2 cup (200 grams) of brown sugar.
Still, you may need to experiment a little, as it may not work well for all recipes.
Lucuma is also a popular flavoring for dishes like ice cream and other desserts.
Plus, it can be added to  yogurt , oatmeal, smoothies, and homemade nut milks to provide a hint of natural sweetness sure to please adults and children alike.

6. Easy to add to your diet
Fresh lucuma fruit may be difficult to find, but lucuma powder is widely available, both online and in health food stores.
You can easily give lucuma powder a try by sprinkling a little over muesli,  oats , or cereals. Alternatively, add some to smoothies or use it instead of sugar in your dessert or baked good recipes.
While lucuma can be added to your diet in many ways, keep in mind that research on this supplement is limited, and its potential side effects are currently unknown.

The bottom line
Lucuma is a fruit native to South America that’s most commonly found as a powdered supplement.
It may offer several health benefits, such as regulating blood sugar levels, improving heart health, and providing a powerful dose of beneficial antioxidants. Still, research is limited.
If you’re curious about this exotic fruit and powder, try replacing table sugar in your drinks or foods with a small quantity of this natural,  healthy sweetener .
