Title: 10 Health Benefits of Turmeric and Curcumin

Many high-quality studies show that turmeric has major benefits for your body and brain. Many of these benefits come from its main active ingredient, curcumin.
The spice known as turmeric could be one of the most effective nutritional supplements in existence.
Read on to learn what the science says about turmeric and curcumin as well as their benefits.

What are turmeric and curcumin?
Turmeric is the spice that gives curry its yellow color. It has been used in India for thousands of years as both a spice and medicinal herb.  Research  has shown that turmeric contains compounds with medicinal properties.
These compounds are called curcuminoids. The most important one is  curcumin , which is the main active ingredient in turmeric.
Here are the top 10 evidence-based health benefits of turmeric and curcumin.

1. Turmeric contains bioactive compounds with medicinal properties
It has  powerful anti-inflammatory effects  and is a very strong antioxidant. That said, the curcumin content of turmeric is only around  1-6% by weight .
Most studies on this herb use turmeric extracts that contain mostly curcumin itself, with dosages usually exceeding 1 gram (g) per day, which means it would be hard to reach these levels just by using turmeric as a spice. That’s why some people choose to use supplements.
In addition, curcumin is poorly absorbed into your bloodstream. In order to experience the full effects of curcumin, its  bioavailability  (the rate at which your body absorbs a substance) needs to improve.
It helps to consume it with  black pepper , which contains piperine. Piperine is a natural substance that enhances the absorption of curcumin by  2,000% .
In fact, the best curcumin supplements contain piperine, and this makes them substantially more effective.
Curcumin is also fat soluble, which means it breaks down and dissolves in fat or oil. That’s why it may be a good idea to take curcumin supplements with a meal that’s high in fat.

2. Curcumin is a natural anti-inflammatory compound
Curcumin is a bioactive substance that can help  fight inflammation , though  very high doses  are required to produce medicinal results.
Still, it means it has the potential to fight the  inflammation  that plays a role in many  health conditions and diseases .
That’s why anything that can help fight chronic inflammation is potentially important in preventing and helping treat these conditions.

3. Turmeric can increase the antioxidant capacity of the body
Oxidative damage is believed to be one of the mechanisms behind aging and many diseases.
It involves free radicals, highly reactive molecules with unpaired electrons. Free radicals tend to react with important organic substances, such as fatty acids,  proteins , or DNA.
Curcumin is a potent antioxidant that can  neutralize free radicals  due to its chemical structure.
In addition,  animal and cellular studies  suggest that curcumin may block the action of free radicals and may stimulate the action of other antioxidants. Further clinical studies are needed in humans to confirm these benefits.

4. Curcumin can boost brain-derived neurotrophic factor
Even in adulthood, brain neurons are capable of forming new connections, and in certain areas of the brain, they can multiply and increase in number.
One of the main drivers of this process is  brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) , which plays a role in memory and learning, and it can be found in areas of the brain responsible for eating, drinking, and body weight.
Many common brain disorders have been linked to  decreased levels of BDNF protein , including depression and Alzheimer’s disease.
Both  animal  and  human  studies have found that curcumin may increase brain levels of BDNF. By doing this, it may be effective in delaying or even reversing many brain diseases and age-related decreases in brain function.
It may also help  improve memory and attention , which seems logical given its effects on BDNF levels. However, more studies are needed to confirm this.

5. Curcumin may lower your risk of heart disease
Heart disease is the  number one  cause of death in the world.  Research  suggests that curcumin may help protect against many steps in the heart disease process.
Specifically, it helps improve the function of the  endothelium  or the lining of your blood vessels.
Endothelial dysfunction is a  major driver of heart disease . This is when your endothelium is unable to regulate blood pressure, blood clotting, and various other factors.
Several other studies  also suggest that curcumin can lead to improvements in  heart health . In addition, curcumin  can help reduce  inflammation and oxidation (as discussed above), which can play a role in heart disease.

6. Turmeric may help prevent cancer
Many different forms of cancer appear to be  affected by curcumin supplements .
In fact, curcumin has been studied as a beneficial herb in  cancer treatment  and has been found to affect cancer growth and development.
Studies  have shown that it can:
contribute to the death of cancerous cells
reduce angiogenesis (growth of new blood vessels in tumors)
reduce metastasis (spread of cancer)
There is also evidence  that curcumin may  prevent cancer  from occurring in the first place, especially cancers of the digestive system like colorectal cancer.

7. Curcumin may be useful in treating Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia and may contribute to up to  70% of dementia cases .
It’s known that inflammation and oxidative damage play a role in Alzheimer’s disease, and curcumin has been found to have  beneficial effects  on both.
In addition,  research suggests  that curcumin can help clear the buildup of protein tangles called amyloid plaques that are caused by the disease.
That said, whether curcumin can slow or even reverse the progression of Alzheimer’s disease in people is currently unknown and needs to be studied.

8. Arthritis patients respond well to curcumin supplements
There are several different types of  arthritis , most of which involve inflammation in the joints.
In a  study  on people with osteoarthritis, curcumin appeared to be more effective in relieving pain than a placebo, and  research  has also found its effect to be similar to that of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
In  another study  on rheumatoid arthritis, curcumin appeared to have helped reduce disease-related inflammation.
That said, more study is needed to understand if curcumin can actually replace such drugs as a treatment for arthritis inflammation pain.

9. Curcumin has benefits against depression
Curcumin has shown some promise in treating mood disorders. Its positive effects on the brain include boosting the brain neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine, reducing inflammation, and encouraging brain plasticity. This suggests the herb  may be  an effective  antidepressant.
Depression is also linked to reduced levels of BDNF and a shrinking hippocampus, a brain area with a role in learning and memory. Curcumin can help  boost BDNF levels , potentially reversing some of these changes.
A  2018 animal study  also found that curcumin may help reduce anxiety, though studies on humans are needed to verify this.

10. Curcumin may help delay aging and fight age-related chronic diseases
If curcumin can really help prevent heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer’s, it may have benefits  for longevity  as well.
This suggests that curcumin may have potential as an anti-aging supplement.
Given that oxidation and inflammation are  believed to play a role  in aging, curcumin may have effects that go way beyond just preventing disease.

Frequently asked questions
Given turmeric’s various beneficial properties to health, it’s not a bad idea to take it daily. If you stick to  12 g or less , you are not likely to experience side effects such as diarrhea, constipation, or vomiting.

The bottom line
Turmeric — and especially its most active compound, curcumin — has many scientifically proven health benefits, such as the potential to improve heart health and prevent Alzheimer’s and cancer.
It’s a potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. It may also help improve symptoms of depression and arthritis.
While these benefits are possible, they are limited at this time because of curcumin’s scarce bioavailability and more research is needed.
