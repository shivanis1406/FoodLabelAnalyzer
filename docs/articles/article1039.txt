Product lineup:  HUM Nutrition offers more than 40 supplements, many of which are designed to target certain conditions or needs, such as sleep,  skin care , and aging.
Quality testing:  All products are tested by third-party labs to ensure that the contents match what’s on the label.

How does HUM Nutrition work?
To get started, the first step is taking a 3-minute health quiz on HUM Nutrition’s website.
The quiz asks for basic health information, such as your usual eating style and your health goals.
Based on your answers, HUM recommends three products that may be a good fit for your goals and needs. You can choose to keep these products and continue to checkout, or edit your cart by adding or removing products.
Once you’ve made your selection, the service will deliver a 30-day supply of your chosen vitamins. Keep in mind that unless you edit your cart, you’ll automatically be sent the same products each subscription period.
After completing the quiz, you’ll also be assigned to one of HUM Nutrition’s staff RDNs. This person can guide you and answer questions about the company’s products.
Additionally, they’ll email you a comprehensive health report, which provides diet and lifestyle advice, recommendations for areas of concern, and more details on your specific product recommendations.

How much does HUM Nutrition cost?
HUM Nutrition’s products range in price from $12 to $60 per bottle.
Shipping is free within the United States (including Alaska and Hawaii) for orders over $50, with a $5.95 fee if you spend less than $50. There’s also a flat $12.95 shipping cost for international deliveries.
HUM Nutrition does provide various discounts, including:
20% off when you select a 3-month subscription plan

“I’ve tried a few products from this brand. They have been great with shipping. I like that they are non-GMO certified, part of the  Clean Label project , and devoted to avoiding putting more plastic in our oceans

“I tested this product for about a month. I took the pill once a day with water, as directed. The capsule is small and easy to swallow.

“I can’t speak to any real scientific facts here, or test results, so I’m not sure if my pH levels were modified by this supplement. [However,] I can say that I didn’t have any issues with taking it or any negative side effects.”

OMG! Omega the Great is a  fish oil supplement  formulated to support the health of the skin, heart, and brain.

Each serving provides 1,400 mg of omega-3 fatty acids sourced from anchovies, which includes both eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

Research suggests that EPA and DHA can  reduce  inflammation and protect against several chronic conditions, such as heart disease.

“I’ve taken fish oil capsules before, and these [from HUM Nutrition] are on the larger side with a distinct fishy aroma. Still, because I like the brand and have no problem swallowing bigger pills, I would definitely continue taking these.”

Big Chill is a daily capsule supplement that contains Rhodiola rosea, an adaptogenic herb that may help with stress.

According to a study conducted by HUM, people taking the supplement had 20% lower stress scores after taking Big Chill for 2 weeks. However, HUM funded the study, which increases the risk of bias.

Additional third-party research is limited but  suggests  a potential benefit of Rhodiola rosea for reducing stress. Still, there’s a need for more high quality studies.

Ingredient quality and safety
HUM Nutrition’s website claims that each product goes beyond Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs), the requirements set forth by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Additionally, each product is tested by an independent third-party lab for:
composition
contaminants
purity
strength
Another benefit is that the company doesn’t use proprietary blends — custom formulations that don’t disclose the exact amount of each ingredient on the supplement label.
Most supplements are also vegan and all products are free of gluten, genetically modified ingredients, and artificial colors, flavors, and sweeteners.
However, some of HUM’s products are made with suboptimal ingredients that your body may not be able to absorb as effectively as other nutrient forms.
For example, HUM’s women’s multivitamin, Base Control, includes  zinc oxide ,  magnesium oxide , and  chromium chloride , which may not be as easily absorbed as other forms of these nutrients.

Are HUM Nutrition supplements effective?
HUM Nutrition selects its ingredients and dosages based on the results of high quality scientific studies. The company has also conducted its own research on the effectiveness of certain products, the results of which are available on  the company’s website .
However, it’s important to take these in-house studies with a grain of salt due to the possibility of bias in the findings and the fact that most are based on survey results or observations made without a control group.
HUM Nutrition offers a number of products that make some lofty claims with minimal evidence to support them.
For example, the Skinny Bird product claims to help reduce appetite are based on one small study of 83 adults. The study found that the main ingredient could  reduce  calorie intake by 245 calories per day. However, this study used a higher dose than the amount found in HUM’s product.
Additionally, while some products may offer some small benefits, it’s important to understand that they will not promote weight loss or fat loss without making other changes to your diet and lifestyle.
On the other hand, products like Gut Instinct and OMG! Omega the Great contain ingredients that have a large body of research to support their use.
HUM Nutrition also includes RDNs and researchers in nearly every step of the process, from developing products and choosing ingredients to providing customer recommendations.
Still, as with any supplement, although some people may find a product effective, there’s no guarantee you’ll experience the same results.

Potential side effects
While HUM Nutrition’s formulations and doses are based on scientific evidence, certain supplements may still cause side effects.
Additionally, if you have known allergies, it’s also important to carefully check each supplement label and ingredient list for potential allergens.
Pregnant and breastfeeding people, anyone younger than 18 years, and people who have pre-existing medical conditions or take prescription medications should also be particularly careful with new supplements.
Finally, make sure to speak with a healthcare professional before adding any new supplement to your routine, especially if you’re in one of the groups mentioned above.

Customer reviews and brand reputation
HUM Nutrition seems to have mostly positive reviews. There are hundreds of excellent reviews on the HUM Nutrition website and only a small handful of negative reviews on review aggregate sites like Trustpilot and Better Business Bureau.
Most of the issues are related to the subscription model or delayed shipping, but a few customers also complain that the supplements they tried caused some digestive upset or didn’t seem to be effective.
Overall, though, most customers report being satisfied with HUM.

Should you try HUM Nutrition?
HUM Nutrition may be worth a try if you:
want access to an RDN for personalized guidance about your vitamin regimen
are interested in high quality supplements that are third-party tested for purity and potency
prefer the convenience of a subscription vitamin service
are looking for products formulated to address specific health concerns
However, keep in mind that HUM Nutrition doesn’t offer daily vitamin packs and may be more expensive than some other services.
It’s best to talk with a healthcare professional before taking any new supplement to ensure that the ingredients and doses are safe and appropriate.
