Title: 13 Cholesterol-Lowering Foods to Add to Your Diet

Some foods may help lower your cholesterol. These could include legumes, beans, nuts, avocados, and fatty fish, among others.
Cholesterol is a fatty substance that is made by the liver and carried through your bloodstream by lipoproteins.
According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , our bodies generate enough blood cholesterol on their own. However, in 2020 nearly 86 million adults in the United States had high cholesterol levels.
High cholesterol has been associated with several health conditions, such as heart attack and stroke.
Your diet may play a key role in helping you manage your cholesterol levels.
Keep reading to learn about 13 foods you can eat to help lower your cholesterol.
Cholesterol  is a waxy substance that is carried through your body by lipoproteins. There are  two types :
Low density lipoprotein (LDL) , or “bad,” cholesterol may build up in the form of plaque in your arteries. These may increase your chance of stroke and heart disease.
High density lipoprotein (HDL) , or “good,” cholesterol helps absorb cholesterol in your blood and transport it back to your liver, where it gets excreted.

1. Legumes
Legumes , also known as pulses, are a group of plant foods that include beans,  peas , and lentils.
A  2021 study  compared the effects of eating beans or white rice on LDL levels. After 29 days, the researchers found that the group who consumed 1 cup of beans each day had significantly lower LDL levels than on day 1.
Similarly, a  2019 review  found that eating legumes helped lower LDL levels.
Legumes may also decrease your risk of certain health conditions,  such as :
obesity
diabetes
high blood pressure (hypertension)
inflammation
Try swapping  legumes  for refined grains and processed meats in dishes like chili, salads, and pasta.

2. Avocados
Avocados  are a rich source of monounsaturated fats and fiber, two  nutrients that help  lower LDL and raise HDL cholesterol.
A  2015 study  in 45 adults with obesity measured the effects of avocados on LDL cholesterol. The researchers found that participants who ate one avocado daily lowered their LDL levels more than those who didn’t eat avocados.
Similarly, a  2016 review  of 10 studies determined that substituting avocados for other fats was linked to lower total cholesterol, LDL, and  triglycerides .
There are  many ways to eat avocados , such as in salads, guacamole, and on toast.

3. Nuts
The authors of a  2023 review  found that  nuts  helped lower levels of LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. In particular, the following nuts had many benefits:
walnuts
almonds
cashews
peanuts
pistachios
According to a 2016 review, one study found that eating a daily serving of  nuts  is linked to a  30% lower risk  of cardiovascular disease.
The authors note that walnuts are also a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids. These are a type of polyunsaturated fats that have been  associated with  improved heart health, lower LDL cholesterol levels, and reduced inflammation.
Similarly, almonds in particular are a natural source of  phytosterols , which may help  lower  your LDL cholesterol.

4. Fatty fish
Fatty fish, such as  salmon  and mackerel, are excellent sources of long-chain  omega-3 fatty acids .
A  2022 review  suggests that these could increase HDL cholesterol and decrease LDL cholesterol, which may lower your risk of developing certain conditions. These may include:
cardiovascular disease
heart disease
hypertension
arrhythmia
cardiac arrest
A  2017 review  of 14 studies found that eating oily fish was associated with increased levels of HDL cholesterol and lower levels of triglycerides.
In a large  25-year study  in adults, people who ate the most non-fried fish were the least likely to develop  metabolic syndrome , a cluster of symptoms that includes high blood pressure and low HDL levels.
The healthiest ways to cook fish are steaming or stewing. Fried fish may  increase  your risk of heart disease and stroke.

5. Whole grains
Extensive research ties  whole grains  to lower heart disease risk.
For example, a  2016 review  of 45 studies linked eating three servings of whole grains daily to a 19% lower risk of heart disease and a 12% lower risk of stroke. Benefits were even greater when people ate up to seven servings of whole grains per day.
Whole grains keep all parts of the  grain  intact. This provides them with more vitamins, minerals, plant compounds, and fiber than  refined grains .
While all whole grains may promote heart health, two grains are particularly noteworthy:
Oats   help lower LDL cholesterol  because they contain beta-glucan. This is a type of soluble fiber that influences the gut microbiome and helps excrete cholesterol and bile in your stool.
Barley  is also  rich in beta-glucans  and can help lower LDL cholesterol.

6. Fruits and berries
Fruit is an excellent addition to a heart-healthy diet for several reasons.
Many types of fruit are rich in  soluble fiber . This  helps lower  cholesterol levels by encouraging your body to get rid of cholesterol and stopping your liver from producing this compound.
A 2012 study found that  pectin , a type of soluble fiber, may lower cholesterol by up to  10% . It’s found in fruits including apples, grapes, citrus fruits, and strawberries, among others.
Fruits have bioactive compounds like anthocyanins, fiber, and phytosterol which may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. A  2019 study  suggests that eating  berries  also helps increase HDL and lower LDL cholesterol.

7. Dark chocolate and cocoa
It may seem too good to be true, but  research suggests  that dark chocolate and  cocoa  may lower LDL cholesterol.
In a  2015 study , adults drank a cocoa beverage twice a day for 1 month. They experienced a reduction in LDL cholesterol of 0.17 mmol/l (6.5 mg/dl). Their blood pressure also decreased and their HDL cholesterol increased.
A  2022 review  also found that several compounds in cocoa may help with  cholesterol management . For example,  polyphenols  may prevent the LDL cholesterol in your blood from oxidation, while  resveratrol  may increase HDL cholesterol.
However, chocolate is often high in added sugar, which negatively affects heart health. You should only use cocoa alone or choose dark chocolate with a cocoa content of 75–85% or higher.

8. Garlic
Garlic  contains various powerful plant compounds, including allicin.
A  2018 meta-analysis  suggests that garlic may help lower LDL and total cholesterol.
That said, it’s important to note that large amounts of garlic are needed to achieve this. As such, garlic supplements may be  more effective  than other garlic preparations.

9. Soy foods
Soybeans  are a type of legume that may be beneficial for heart health. However, research on how they affect cholesterol is mixed.
For example, a  2021 review  suggests that soybean oil may help lower LDL cholesterol when it replaces saturated fats. Similarly, a  2015 review  of 35 studies linked  soy foods  to reduced LDL and total cholesterol, as well as increased HDL cholesterol.
However, a  2020 study  found that soy protein didn’t affect LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol.
To add more soy in your diet, try replacing meat with  tofu  or cooking with  soybean oil .

10. Vegetables
Vegetables  are a vital part of a  heart-healthy diet  because they’re rich in rich in fiber,  antioxidants , and nutrients. They’ve also been  associated with  better LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol levels.
A  2020 review  found that eating more than three servings of fruits and vegetables per day helped lower levels of tryglicerides, blood pressure, and LDL and total cholesterol.
A  2021 review  of 37 guideline documents found that most of them suggested eating a diet high in vegetables.
Some  ways to get more vegetables in your diet  include making soups, cauliflower pizza crusts, and smoothies. You can also add vegetables to casseroles, sauces, and burgers.

11. Tea
Tea harbors many plant compounds that improve your heart health.
For example, a  2020 review  of 31 studies found that  green tea  helps lower LDL and total cholesterol levels.
The primary compound in green tea responsible for these effects is catechins. These  help  lower inflammation, oxidation, and carcinogen levels.
Black tea  and  white tea  have similar properties and health effects on cholesterol.
It’s important to note that although most studies associate tea with lower total and LDL cholesterol,  research is mixed  on its effects on HDL cholesterol.

12. Dark leafy greens
Dark leafy greens, such as  kale ,  spinach , and  Swiss chard  contain lutein and other carotenoids, which are  linked  to a lower risk of heart disease.
Dark leafy greens  may also help lower cholesterol levels. The authors of a  2019 study  in rats suggest that this is done because they bind to bile acids and help your body excrete more cholesterol.
A  2011 study  in guinea pigs also found that lutein lowers levels of oxidized LDL cholesterol and could help prevent cholesterol from binding to artery walls.

13. Extra virgin olive oil
Extra virgin olive oil  is one of the most important foods in the heart-healthy  Mediterranean diet .
A  2019 review  compared the effects of olive oil with other plant-based oils on cholesterol levels. The researchers found that olive oil had a bigger impact on increasing HDL cholesterol. However, it didn’t have much effect on LDL and total cholesterol.
Similarly, a  2022 review  found that consuming 20 grams per day of olive oil helped increase HDL cholesterol. However, overall, the authors concluded that olive oil had minimal impacts on LDL, triglycerides, and total cholesterol.
More research is needed to fully support  olive oil  as a cholesterol-friendly food.
