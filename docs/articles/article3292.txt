Title: 7 Potential Health Benefits of Avocado

Avocados are a source of key nutrients, including healthy fats and fiber. They also contain anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds and may help reduce heart disease risk.
Nutritious, versatile, and delicious, avocados have become a kitchen staple in many homes around the world.
While some people refer to avocados as fruits and some people say they’re a vegetable, avocados  (Persea americana)  are actually considered fruits,  specifically berries . They’re a member of the Lauraceae plant family, which also includes the cinnamon tree.
Avocados are native to Mexico and Central America, but they are cultivated in many areas of the world, including North America.
In the United States, California is the top producer of avocados and is home to more than  5,000 avocado farms , which generate over  400 million pounds  of avocados each year.
These fruits are an important part of traditional Mexican, Central American, and South American cuisine and are used in dishes like guacamole, salads, tacos, and more.
Avocados are extremely popular in the health and wellness world because they’re highly nutritious and have been linked to several health benefits.
This article lists 7 benefits of eating avocados, including more about nutrition, weight loss, and how to enjoy them.

1. Excellent source of nutrients
Avocados are high in a number of important nutrients, many of which are lacking in modern diets.
Here is the  nutrition breakdown  for a 7-ounce (201-gram) avocado:
Calories:  322
Fat:  30 grams
Protein:  4 grams
Carbs:  17 grams
Fiber:  14 grams
Vitamin C:  22% of the  daily value (DV)
Vitamin E:  28% of the DV
Vitamin K:  35% of the DV
Riboflavin (B2):  20% of the DV
Niacin (B3):  22% of the DV
Pantothenic acid (B5):  56% of the DV
Pyridoxine (B6):  30% of the DV
Folate:  41% of the DV
Magnesium:  14% of the DV
Potassium:  21% of the DV
Copper:  42% of the DV
Manganese:  12% of the DV
As you can see, avocados are exceptionally nutritious fruits and are a concentrated source of  healthy fats  and fiber, plus a number of vitamins and minerals.
They’re rich in nutrients that are often lacking in many people’s diets, including magnesium, B6, vitamin C, vitamin E, and folate.
For example, half of an avocado packs 10% of the DV for potassium.
Potassium  is considered a “nutrient of public health concern” by the  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services . This is because it’s a mineral that Americans commonly do not consume enough of.
In fact, a  2015 study  that included data on 4,730 U.S. adults found that fewer than 3% had potassium intakes greater than the set daily value (DV) for potassium of  4,700 mg  per day.
Potassium is needed for several critical bodily functions, including blood pressure regulation and nervous system function. Getting the recommended amount of potassium on a daily basis  may help protect  against hypertension and stroke.
Avocados also provide nutrients that are essential for the health of the  immune system , including vitamin C, B6, and E.
Half of an avocado provides 15% of your daily needs for B6, a nutrient that plays many key roles in the body including heart health, cancer prevention, and cognitive function.
Avocados contain an abundance of nutrients that are essential for optimal health, and regularly consuming avocados could help improve overall diet quality.

2. Beneficial for gut health
Avocados are high in fiber, providing about  14 grams  in each avocado. That’s nearly half of the current DV for this important nutrient.
Getting enough fiber in your diet is essential for the health of the digestive system because it helps promote the growth of  healthy bacteria .
A  study with 163 adults  considered overweight found that people who consumed 175 grams (men) or 140 grams (women) of avocado daily for 12 weeks had lower fecal bile acid concentrations and increased bacterial diversity compared to a control group.
Greater bile acid concentrations induce intestinal inflammation and are related to the growth of microbes associated with negative health outcomes like colon cancer.
Additionally, the avocado group had more of the bacteria  Faecalibacterium, Lachnospira , and  Alistipes , all of which produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including butyrate. SFCAs help fuel colon cells and protect against diseases like colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease.
Even though these findings are promising, this study was partially funded by the Hass Avocado Board, which could have influenced study results.
Also, keep in mind that all  fiber-containing foods , including fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, are important for gut health. The most important factor in supporting digestive health is eating a variety of fiber-containing foods, not just avocados.

3. May help reduce heart disease risk factors
Regularly consuming  nutrient-dense foods  like avocados could help protect against heart disease.
The vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, and fiber found in avocados all play a role in keeping the cardiovascular system healthy.
Study findings   suggest  that an avocado-rich diet may help improve heart disease risk factors, which may help prevent the onset of heart disease.
Many studies investigating the effects of avocados on heart health were funded by the Hass Avocado Board. Even though this doesn’t discredit study findings,  some experts  suggest that industry involvement in peer-reviewed research could skew results.
Nonetheless, avocados may help increase heart-protective HDL cholesterol and decrease levels of oxidized LDL cholesterol, a type of cholesterol that’s significantly associated with atherosclerosis, or the buildup of plaque along artery walls.
Additionally, the high potassium and magnesium content of avocados is beneficial for blood pressure regulation. Keeping blood pressure at a healthy level is critical for heart disease prevention.

4. A rich source of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds
In addition to vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, and fiber, avocados are packed with bioactive compounds including  carotenoids , vitamin C, vitamin E, and phenolic compounds.
These substances have been shown to have significant antioxidant, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective activities.
For example, carotenoids found in avocados including lutein, α-Carotene, and β-Carotene  have been shown  to have strong antioxidant effects, protecting against oxidative damage, which is associated with the progression of many chronic diseases.
Because avocados are high in  antioxidants , regularly eating avocados may help increase the body’s antioxidant defenses.
A small study  that included 45 people found that eating an avocado a day increased blood levels of the carotenoid lutein compared with a typical Western diet without avocado.
What’s more, having greater dietary intake and higher blood levels of antioxidants contained within avocados, like vitamin C and carotenoids, has been associated with  better cognitive function ,  improved heart health , and more.

5. May help promote a healthy body weight
Although there are multiple factors that influence  weight , following a nutritious and balanced diet is perhaps most important when it comes to reaching and maintaining a healthy body weight, which is critical for disease prevention.
Although avocados are high in calories, they’re packed with nutrients and help promote satiety, thanks to their high fiber and healthy fat content.
Research shows that following a dietary pattern rich in fibrous foods, like fruits and  vegetables , may help support weight loss. Plus, people who eat more fiber  tend to maintain  healthier body weights compared to those who follow lower fiber diets.
In  a study  that included 345 people, it was found that fiber intake was the most influential predictor of body weight, independent of calorie and macronutrient intake.
Plus, a number of studies have associated avocado intake with  decreased weight gain ,  improved satiety , and  decreased abdominal fat .
However, nearly all studies investigating the effects of avocado consumption on weight loss are funded by the Hass Avocado Board. Again, although this doesn’t discredit study results, food industry funding may influence study outcomes.
Regardless, it’s clear that increasing foods rich in dietary fiber likely promotes weight loss by promoting satiety. So, eating more high-fiber foods, like avocados, may be a good choice for those wishing to  promote weight management  or maintain body weight.

6. A smart choice during pregnancy and breastfeeding
During  pregnancy  and breastfeeding, nutrient demands significantly increase.
For example, during pregnancy:
Folate  requirements increase from  400 μg to 600 μg .
Potassium needs jump from  2,600 mg to 2,900 mg .
Vitamin C needs increase from  75 to 85 mg .
Folate needs increase significantly during pregnancy. Unfortunately, many pregnant people around the world fall short of the recommended folate intake, which may increase the risk of pregnancy complications.
One avocado delivers  27%  of the recommended folate intake during pregnancy.
Eating avocados can also help you reach the recommended intake levels for nutrients that are needed in greater amounts during pregnancy and  breastfeeding , like vitamin C, potassium, and B6.
Additionally, the high fiber content of avocados may help prevent constipation, which is extremely common during pregnancy.
For a satisfying pregnancy- and breastfeeding-friendly meal or snack idea, try topping whole grain toast (carbs) with 1/2 an avocado (fat) and over-easy egg or scoop of cottage cheese (for protein).

7. Versatile and delicious ingredient
In addition to being highly nutritious, avocados can be used in a number of recipes, both sweet and savory. This makes them a smart ingredient to have on hand.
Here are some ideas for how to incorporate more avocado into your diet:
Use avocado in place of mayo with  Greek yogurt  in chicken, salmon, egg, and tuna salads.
Make a classic guacamole using ingredients like avocados, onions, lime, and cilantro.
Top chicken breasts with a salad of tomato and cubed avocado.
Toss frozen avocado chunks into smoothies for a source of healthy fat.
Top chilis and soups with sliced avocado.
Incorporate avocado into salads and grain bowls.
Whip up a dairy-free avocado chocolate mousse.
Bread avocados and bake them for a crispy treat.
Pair half an avocado with eggs and berries for a  filling breakfast .
Smash avocado on top of toast or a half roasted sweet potato.
Stuff avocados with chicken salad or bean salad.
Use avocados in tacos and burritos.
Blend avocado with olive oil, lemon juice, and seasonings for a quick and easy creamy dressing.
Top your favorite burger with sliced avocado.
Sprinkle an avocado half with a bit of coarse salt and pepper and enjoy it right out of the rind.
There are so many ways to use avocados, so don’t be afraid to experiment.
If you’re looking for a way to keep your avocados as fresh as possible, place ripe avocados in the refrigerator until you’re ready to enjoy them.
If your avocado is still hard and green, let it sit on your counter for several days to ripen.
Ripe avocados are slightly soft to the touch and usually have a deep green color. If your avocado is very mushy and dents when poked, it’s likely past its prime.
However, even overripe avocados can be incorporated into recipes like baked goods and dressings, so don’t toss them unless they have a sour taste or smell, are moldy, or if the flash is extremely discolored.

The bottom line
Avocados contain an impressive amount of nutrients and are especially rich in fiber, B6, vitamin C, potassium, vitamin E, folate, and copper.
Eating avocados regularly may benefit health in several ways, including protecting against heart disease, improving overall diet quality, improving satiety, and promoting gut health.
Plus, they’re versatile and delicious.
Try this today:  To give smoothies a creamy texture, I love adding a few chunks of fresh or frozen avocado to my blender. Avocado has a mild taste that pairs well with most smoothie ingredients. I love making green smoothies with kale, avocado, cucumber, lemon, ginger, parsley, and grapefruit juice.
