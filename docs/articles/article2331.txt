Title: The 11 Best Pre-Workout Supplements According to a Dietitian

Pre-workout supplements are performance-boosting products intended for consumption prior to a workout.
Their popularity has increased in recent years, with some estimates suggesting they are the second most commonly consumed type of supplement, behind multivitamins ( 1 ).
There’s no single definition for what a pre-workout supplement should contain. Ingredients range in type and amount, depending on the product.
Most often, pre-workout supplements include caffeine as an active ingredient along with a combination of other compounds such as creatine, amino acids, and vitamins.
If you’re looking for a pre-workout supplement, it’s best to evaluate your choice based on the most up-to-date research while also ensuring that the option you choose is third-party tested for quality and purity.

Healthline’s picks of the best pre-workout supplements
Price:  $
Flavors:  Acai Berry, Strawberry Lemonade
Active ingredients:  vitamin B12, caffeine, electrolytes
Vega is a plant-based supplement company with a line of sport-specific products that are third-party tested and  NSF Certified for Sport.
The Vega Sport Pre-Workout Energizer is our pick for the best plant-based pre-workout because it combines  caffeine  and carbohydrates, a combination that has been shown to boost performance ( 2 ,  3 ).
One serving contains 100 mg of caffeine per serving, plus 16 grams of carbohydrates, which are primarily from coconut palm sugar and brown rice syrup.
Each serving contains the same amount of caffeine as a cup of home-brewed coffee — a smaller amount than is typical for pre-workout supplements.
A single serving also contains sodium chloride, potassium, magnesium, and calcium —  electrolytes  that play a vital role in hydration ( 4 ).
In addition, a single serving contains 1.2 mcg of vitamin B12, a nutrient that’s often lacking in vegan and vegetarian diets ( 5 ,  6 ).

The Garden of Life Sport Organic Pre-Workout Energy + Focus Sugar Free supplement is third-party tested, NSF Certified for Sport, and  Informed Choice for Sport Certified .
One serving contains 85 mg of caffeine per scoop in addition to a nitric oxide booster made of a combination of spinach, beet, and kale, all of which provide a source of dietary nitrates.
Dietary nitrates are compounds that positively affect exercise performance when converted to nitric oxide after ingestion.
Nitric oxide  has been found to increase blood flow to working muscles, improve oxygen efficiency during exercise, and reduce time to exhaustion ( 7 ,  8 ).
This plant-based supplement also contains vitamins B12, C, and K and an antioxidant blend.
Just keep in mind that this product contains erythritol, a sugar alcohol, which some people may prefer to avoid.

Flavors:  Strawberry Lemonade, Tropical Fruit
Active ingredients:  L-citrulline, L-theanine, creatine monohydrate, beta-alanine, caffeine
Ladder Pre-Workout is third-party tested and NSF Certified for Sport.
It’s made with a combination of creatine monohydrate, beta-alanine, L-citrulline, L-theanine, phosphatidylserine, and caffeine.
One serving contains 5 grams of creatine, 1.6 grams of beta-alanine, 200 mg of caffeine, and 6 grams of L-citrulline.
This pre-workout is our pick for the best for recovery because it contains  L-citrulline , a nonessential amino acid that may aid recovery by reducing muscle soreness after exercise ( 9 ,  10 ).
The additions of creatine and beta-alanine also offer performance-enhancing benefits.
At the recommended intake of 3–5 grams per day,  creatine  has been found to act as a performance-enhancing compound that also increases lean muscle mass when used in combination with short, high intensity exercise bouts ( 11 ).
Additionally, beta-alanine has a performance-enhancing effect through mechanisms that delay muscle fatigue. Research suggests that doses of 4–6 grams per day for 2–4 weeks are the most effective ( 12 ).

Flavors:  Lemon Tea
Active ingredients:  caffeine, nitrates
Klean Pre-Workout is a vegan supplement that’s third-party tested and NSF Certified for Sport.
One scoop contains 75 mg of caffeine and 5 grams of TruBeet Beet Root Extract.
Because it contains  beetroot  — a source of dietary nitrates that may have a positive effect on endurance exercise performance — this our top choice pre-workout for endurance exercise ( 13 ,  14 ).
The powder is sweetened with a combination of sugar and stevia leaf and is free of artificial flavors and colors.

Promix Pre-Workout comes in six flavors, all of which are third-party tested. The Lemon flavor is also NSF Certified for Sport.
One serving of this pre-workout supplement contains 200 mg of caffeine and 3.2 grams of beta-alanine. A single serving also includes 1 gram of  taurine , an amino acid that may help reduce delayed onset muscle soreness ( 15 ).
This supplement is our top pick for focus because it also contains  L-tyrosine , a nonessential amino acid that may have a positive effect on cognitive function ( 16 ,  17 ).
One drawback is the higher dose of beta-alanine, which can cause a tingling sensation known as paraesthesia. While research suggests this is a harmless side effect, Promix does offer a “tingle-free” flavor without beta-alanine for those who prefer to avoid that ingredient ( 12 ).

Gnarly Pre-Workout is a third-party tested supplement that’s NSF Content Verified. One flavor, Strawberry Lemonade, is also NSF Certified for Sport.
One serving of this pre-workout contains 180 mg of caffeine, 2.5 grams of beta-alanine, 5 grams of citrulline malate, and 4 grams of vegan BCAAs.
Beta-alanine  has been found to affect muscle fatigue and improve strength performance when taken at the recommended dose of 4–6 grams per day for 2–4 weeks. However, it can cause uncomfortable side effects in some people ( 12 ).
Gnarly Pre-Workout also contains citrulline malate, a compound that may have a positive effect on performance during high intensity exercise.
Citrulline malate has been found to improve blood flow to working muscles while also reducing fatigue during  high intensity exercise  and strength training. However, research is mixed regarding dose and effectiveness ( 18 ,  19 ).

Flavors:  Orange Mango, Raspberry Lemonade
Active ingredients:  caffeine, whey protein isolate
Ascent Pre-Workout is third-party tested and Informed Sport Certified. One serving contains 150 mg of caffeine and 5 grams of protein from  whey protein  isolate.
This pre-workout supplement is unique in that it doesn’t contain creatine or beta-alanine. That means it’s a better choice if you’re looking for a supplement that provides a performance boost from caffeine alone.
While the caffeine in this pre-workout does offer a performance boost, the minimal protein per serving is unlikely to affect performance or recovery. However, the supplement can still contribute to total daily protein intake to support muscle protein synthesis ( 4 ,  20 ,  21 ,  22 ).

Pre-Kaged is a pre-workout supplement that’s third-party tested and Informed Sport Certified.
With 274 mg of caffeine per serving, Pre-Kaged is higher in caffeine than many other pre-workouts. If you’re looking for a significant source of caffeine in a single serving, Pre-Kaged Pre-Workout is our pick for the best caffeinated option.
Up to 400 mg of  caffeine  per day has been found to be safe for consumption, with milligrams per kilogram of body weight providing a guide for customizing based on individual needs.
Research shows that 1.3–2.7 mg of caffeine per pound (3–6 mg per kg) of body weight has a performance benefit ( 23 ,  24 ).
Pre-Kaged Pre-Workout also contains L-citrulline, BCAAs, beta-alanine, creatine HCL, and a proprietary blend of antioxidants.

The Thorne Training Bundle is a unique pre-workout because it’s a combination of three separate supplements intended to be taken together instead of a single pre-mixed powder.
This approach may be cumbersome for those who are looking for a simple pre-workout supplement routine. However, the ability to split the ingredients based on individual needs may be appealing to some.
The combination includes creatine, an  amino acid  complex, and a sustained-release formulation of beta-alanine. All three formulations are caffeine-free, making this our top choice for those looking to avoid caffeine.
In addition, all three products are third-party tested and NSF Certified for Sport.
One serving of the bundle provides 1.6 grams of beta-alanine, 7.6 grams of amino acids, and 5 grams of creatine monohydrate.

A comparison of the best pre-workouts
Here’s a quick look at how our top picks compare:

How to choose a pre-workout supplement
When shopping for a pre-workout, it’s important to consider your individual training goals, as well as the following factors:
Active ingredients:  Look for active ingredients known to impact performance. Ingredients such as caffeine, beta-alanine, creatine, nitrates, and BCAAs have all been studied for their performance benefits ( 28 ).
Individual needs:  Choose a pre-workout supplement with ingredients specific to your needs. Supplement formulations vary by brand, so it’s important to review labels for ingredients you may need to avoid.
Additives and sweeteners:  Many pre-workouts contain  artificial ingredients , such as flavors, colors, and sweeteners, that some people may prefer to avoid. Be sure to read labels carefully to ensure you’re purchasing a product that fits your needs and preferences.
Third-party testing:  Because the FDA does not regulate supplements in the same way as pharmaceuticals, third-party testing is the only way to ensure that a pre-workout contains the types and amounts of ingredients that it claims to on the label.
Furthermore, competitive athletes should look for products that are certified safe for sport.
As Kelly Jones, MS, RD, performance dietitian and owner of  StudentAthleteNutrition.com , explains, “It’s imperative that pre-workout supplements be third-party tested, either by NSF for Sport or Informed Sport, to ensure that they’re free of substances banned by most sports governing bodies, including anabolic steroids and prescription drugs.”
Checking labels and product websites is the best way to confirm that the product you choose is third-party tested.

Benefits of pre-workouts
Pre-workout supplements  can offer a variety of performance benefits, depending on their active ingredients and the amounts they contain.
“The benefits of pre-workout include reduced fatigue, improved cognitive function, delay in muscle soreness, and improved performance,” explains Sara Cully, RD, certified personal trainer and owner of Sara Cully Nutrition.
Common ingredients in pre-workout supplements, such as caffeine, beta-alanine, and creatine, may have a positive effect on performance when taken in the amounts recommended in the research ( 28 ,  29 ).
Research suggests that caffeine has an effect on perceived effort, beta-alanine has an effect on fatigue during high intensity exercise, and creatine contributes to increases in strength when taken over a period of time ( 12 ,  23 ,  30 )
Additional pre-workout ingredients, such as tyrosine, may influence cognitive function, and others, such as nitrates, may have a positive effect on endurance ( 7 ,  8 ,  16 ).
However, it’s a good idea to make sure that any supplement you add to your diet is included only in combination with a  balanced diet  that meets your energy needs.
“I always suggest food first, supplementation second,” says Cully. “Once nutrition and sleep is consistent, supplementing can help some individuals improve performance if it is suitable for them.”
Wisconsin-based sports dietitian Abby Olcott, MS, RDN, explains, “A pre-workout supplement can be helpful to give the body the extra capacity to push harder and longer during workouts, improving the adaptations made from those workouts.”
However, she points out that no pre-workout supplement can make up for a diet that doesn’t meet your energy needs or is missing essential nutrients.
“If you can’t get through a workout without taking a pre-workout supplement, it may be a sign that you are under-fueling and need more energy from food,” she says.
For this reason, prioritizing diet and  recovery  before adding a pre-workout supplement is the most advantageous approach for performance. Always talk with a sports dietitian or another healthcare professional before taking a supplement.

Science behind pre-workout supplements
Because pre-workout supplements vary in ingredient composition, it can be difficult to compare brands and dosages. Knowing which ingredients impact performance can help you determine which supplement is best for you.
Research suggests that the following ingredients provide performance benefits.
Caffeine is a known central nervous stimulant that offers a performance benefit when taken  prior to exercise .
Cully explains that caffeine can be helpful in both aerobic and anaerobic activity.
“It’s been consistently shown to improve performance when dosed at 3–6 mg/kg body mass,” she says. “An added benefit of using caffeine is the bonus in cognitive function that is seen, which can help in the skills required for sports, like timing and responsiveness.”
Be sure to look for a pre-workout that contains the optimal caffeine dose according to research ( 23 ).
Beta-alanine is a nonessential amino acid that plays a role in buffering muscle pH during high intensity exercise such as  sprinting . “Research for doses of 4–6 grams daily is common, but more research is needed for specifics in dosing,” explains Cully ( 12 ,  31 )
Nitrates are found in foods such as beets, celery, and  leafy green vegetables  like spinach. They’re also a common ingredient in pre-workout supplements.
Nitrates enhance performance by acting to dilate blood vessels and increase blood flow. “Nitrates may also help to lower the oxygen cost of exercise, which leads to improved efficiency during exercise, especially endurance workouts,” explains Olcott ( 7 ,  8 ).
Creatine monohydrate  is a compound that’s commonly found in pre-workout supplements.
Its effect is not as immediate as those of other compounds, such as caffeine. Research indicates that creatine monohydrate must be taken over a consistent period of time to have a performance benefit ( 11 ,  30 ).
“[Creatine monohydrate] takes time to improve performance with supplementing,” explains Cully.
“You can’t take just one dose of creatine and see performance improvements in your next workout. It will take, depending on the individual, about 30 days to saturate the muscles with a creatine dose of 3–5 grams daily.”
Other ingredients, such as proprietary antioxidant blends, herbs, and high dose vitamins and minerals, require more research to confirm their effectiveness for supporting athletic performance.

Potential side effects
Potential side effects  from pre-workout supplements depend on the ingredient types and amounts found in the supplement.
Some common ingredients can result in side effects that may be unpleasant for some people. Common ingredients in pre-workout supplements and their potential side effects are listed below.
Caffeine:  reported side effects include headache, digestive upset, rapid heart rate, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping ( 32 )
Beta-alanine:  reported side effects include a tingling sensation when high doses are consumed ( 12 )
Citrulline malate:  may result in digestive discomfort for some people ( 19 )
Creatine monohydrate:  may result in short-term water retention ( 33 )
Additionally, some ingredients may interact with medications, so it’s important to speak with a sports dietitian or another healthcare professional before taking a pre-workout supplement.
Keep in mind that although pre-workout supplements can give you a boost of energy, it’s important to make sure you’re not using them in place of a healthy diet and lifestyle, which is the best way to support your workout plan.

Frequently asked questions
Pre-workout supplements may be appropriate for both untrained and trained people looking for a performance boost. Ingredient formulations will greatly influence the effects of the pre-workout supplement.
If you’re interested in trying a pre-workout supplement, it’s important to evaluate the available products based on your individual needs and health status and to check with a healthcare professional before trying one.
Pre-workout supplements often contain stimulants, such as caffeine, that may not be appropriate for some people.
Anyone with a chronic health condition, such as heart disease or high blood pressure, and anyone who is pregnant or nursing should consult a sports dietitian or another healthcare professional before taking a pre-workout supplement.
It’s difficult to compare creatine alone to multi-ingredient pre-workout supplements because of the variations in their formulations.
Multi-ingredient pre-workout supplements have different ingredient amounts and variations that influence their effectiveness. Additionally, many pre-workout supplements include creatine in combination with other ingredients that also affect performance.
Consider taking a  creatine supplement  if you’re committed to taking a supplement over a longer period of time, as research shows that creatine should be consumed over multiple days to fully saturate muscles ( 11 ).
Other pre-workout ingredients, such as caffeine and beta-alanine, can have more immediate effects. This may make them more appropriate options for those who are looking for a performance boost after a single serving.

The bottom line
Pre-workout supplements may help boost your exercise performance.
Before adding a pre-workout supplement to your routine, consider your nutritional needs and fitness goals. Not all pre-workout supplements are created equal, so it’s important to customize your choice based on your needs.
Optimal nutrition and improved fitness depend on a balanced diet that meets your individual needs. In addition to maintaining a nutritious diet, allowing enough  time for recovery  after workouts is essential.
