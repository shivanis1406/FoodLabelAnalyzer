Title: 22 Simple and Healthy Whole30 Snacks

Whole30 is a 30-day program meant to act as an elimination diet to identify food sensitivities.
This program bans added sugars, artificial sweeteners, dairy, grains, beans, alcohol, and food additives like carrageenan and monosodium glutamate (MSG). It also discourages snacking and instead promotes eating three meals per day.
However, snacking may be necessary for some people on this diet due to various factors, such as calorie requirements and activity levels.
If you decide to snack, you can choose from a variety of Whole30-approved options.
Here are 22 simple and healthy snacks for the Whole30 program.

1. Apple and cashew-butter sandwiches
Though peanuts and peanut butter aren’t allowed on the Whole30 program,  other nuts  and nut butters are.
Cashew butter is loaded with nutrients like healthy fats, magnesium, manganese, and copper. Its smooth, sweet taste pairs well with  apples  ( 1 ).
Spread 1 tablespoon (16 grams) of cashew butter on 2 sliced apple rounds, sandwich them together, and enjoy.

2. Turmeric deviled eggs
Deviled eggs are made by removing the yolks of  hard-boiled eggs , mashing the cooked yolk with mayo, mustard, vinegar, pepper, and salt, then placing the mixture back into the egg white.
Plain deviled eggs are a protein-rich, tasty snack, and adding turmeric can raise their nutritional value even more.
Turmeric  contains curcumin, a polyphenol compound with powerful antioxidant effects that may offer several health benefits, including reduced inflammation ( 2 ).
Be sure to use Whole30-compliant mayo and mustard with no added sugar when whipping up this simple recipe.

3. Chocolate energy balls
The official Whole30 plan discourages treats, even when they’re made with approved ingredients ( 3 ).
However, you can occasionally indulge in a sweet yet healthy snack made from Whole30-approved ingredients like dates, cashews, and  cocoa powder .
These energy balls  make the perfect treat and comply with the Whole30 program.

4. Sprouted pumpkin seeds
Pumpkin seeds are a nutritious Whole30 snack that can keep you satisfied between meals.
High in protein, healthy fats, magnesium, and zinc, they can be combined with other healthy Whole30 ingredients, including  dried fruit  or coconut flakes, for a filling snack.
Sprouted  pumpkin seeds  are a smart choice, as the sprouting process may increase the availability of nutrients like zinc and protein ( 4 ).
Shop for pumpkin seeds online.

5. Avocado hummus with bell peppers
Whole30 bans legumes like chickpeas. Still, you can whip up a tasty chickpea-free hummus using  avocados , cooked cauliflower, and a few other healthy ingredients.
Try out  this avocado hummus recipe  and pair it with bell peppers or any other crunchy, non-starchy vegetable of your choice.

6. Whole30 bento box
Bento boxes are containers split into several sections, each of which is for a different dish.
Try including a variety of Whole30 foods in your bento box for a hearty snack. For example, pair a hard-boiled egg with sliced vegetables and guacamole — or leftover chicken salad with  sweet potatoes  — and add sliced peaches for dessert.

7. Coconut-yogurt pumpkin parfait
Coconut yogurt is a rich, dairy-free yogurt high in healthy fats.
Pumpkin purée blends easily with coconut yogurt and provides an excellent source of carotenoids, which offer powerful  antioxidant  and anti-inflammatory properties ( 5 ).
Follow  this recipe  for a creamy, delicious parfait, but be sure to omit the maple syrup and granola to make it fit Whole30.

8. Sweet-potato toast with mashed avocado
Sweet-potato toast is a healthy option for those craving a Whole30-approved substitute for bread. Just follow  this simple recipe .
This root vegetable is an excellent source of nutrients, including fiber, carotenoids, and  vitamin C . Topping thin, toasted slices with mashed avocado makes for a particularly tasty combination ( 6 ).
Drizzle sweet-potato toast with  lemon juice , a dash of sea salt, and crushed red pepper to boost its flavor.

9. Onion-and-chive mixed nuts
Mixed nuts are loaded with nutrients and provide a  plant-based source of protein .
Plus, research shows that snacking on nuts may promote weight loss and increase fullness, making them a great choice for anyone trying to shed excess weight on the Whole30 plan ( 7 ,  8 ,  9 ).
These chive-and-onion mixed nuts  are sure to satisfy your salty cravings and make an excellent Whole30-approved substitute for chips.

10. Stuffed peppers
Stuffed peppers make not only a healthy meal but also a hearty snack. Peppers are low in calories and loaded with fiber, vitamin C, provitamin A, B vitamins, and  potassium  ( 10 ).
Stuffing them with a protein source like ground  chicken or turkey  is a great way to make sure you stay full throughout the day.
Try out this nutrient-packed, Whole30-compliant  stuffed-pepper recipe .

11. Baked carrot fries
Although sweet and regular potatoes are commonly used to make fries,  carrots  make an excellent alternative. They contain fewer calories and carbs than potatoes, so they’re great for people on low carb diets following Whole30 ( 11 ,  12 ).
This recipe  uses Whole30-friendly almond flour to create extra crispy carrot fries, which serve as an excellent snack or side.

12. Canned salmon
Canned or packaged salmon is a concentrated source of protein and anti-inflammatory  omega-3 fats . It makes a nutritious snack for people on Whole30 who follow a pescatarian diet ( 13 ,  14 ).
Plus, it’s a filling and convenient snack that can be enjoyed on the go.

13. Mixed-berry chia pudding
When you’re in the mood for something sweet on the Whole30 plan,  chia pudding  is a good substitute for sugar-laden treats.
The fiber, healthy fats, and protein from the chia seeds pair splendidly with the natural sweetness of mixed berries in  this delicious recipe .

14. Arugula salad with sundried tomatoes and fried egg
Salads are not only rich in nutrients but also versatile, making them the perfect choice for healthy Whole30 snacks.
Arugula is a  leafy green  that’s packed with antioxidants like carotenoids, glucosinolates, and vitamin C ( 15 ).
Try topping a few handfuls of raw arugula with a fried egg and sundried tomatoes for a unique snack.

15. Banana and pecan-butter rounds
Bananas  are a filling choice on their own, but pairing them with protein-packed pecan butter creates a heartier snack.
Pecan butter is an excellent source of plant-based protein and particularly high in manganese, which is essential for metabolism and immune function. This mineral also protects against cellular damage caused by unstable molecules known as free radicals ( 16 ).
To make a tasty snack, slice a banana into rounds, then top with a dollop of pecan butter. Sprinkle with  cacao nibs  for a crunchy, chocolatey twist. You can also freeze the rounds if you desire.

16. Collard-green-and-chicken spring rolls
The thick leaves of collard greens are packed with vitamins and minerals and make a great replacement for traditional  rice-based  wraps for spring rolls.
This recipe  rolls non-starchy veggies, chicken breast, and a Whole30-compliant almond-butter sauce into collard-green leaves.

17. Creamy tuna salad on celery boats
Tuna is a great snack choice for the Whole30 program because it’s  packed with protein  and comes in portable containers.
Tuna salad made with Whole30-approved mayo works well with crunchy celery.
At work, simply stock your fridge with fresh celery sticks and keep  tuna  packets in your desk drawer so that you always have healthy ingredients handy.
Shop for sustainability-certified tuna packets online.

18. Loaded sweet-potato nachos
Although  tortilla chips  aren’t permitted on the Whole30 program, you can make a delicious nacho platter using sweet potatoes as a base.
Simply top thinly sliced, baked sweet-potato rounds with avocado, bell peppers, onions, and shredded or ground chicken, then bake at 400°F (205°C) for 15–20 minutes, or follow a recipe like  this one . As the recipe points out, you can use vegan cheese for a fully Whole30 version.

19. Plantain chips and cauliflower hummus
Plantains, also called cooking bananas, are starchy fruits with a neutral flavor, making them a perfect choice for those on  grain-free diets  like Whole30. What’s more, they can be made into chips and pair well with savory dips like hummus.
As store-bought chips of any kind are not permitted on the Whole30 program, you have to make your own  plantain  chips from scratch.
Follow  this simple recipe  and pair the finished product with  this  Whole30-friendly, cauliflower-based hummus.

20. Premade drinkable soups
Vegetable soups are a filling  snack  on the Whole30 program and can be purchased premade either online or at specialty grocery stores.
Medlie  is a drinkable soup brand that makes a variety of Whole30-approved veggie drinks, including flavors like kale-avocado, carrot-ginger-turmeric, and beet-orange-basil.
Shop for other Whole30-friendly soups and bone broths online.

21. Trail mix with almonds, cacao nibs, and dried cherries
One of the easiest and most versatile snacks to make on the Whole30 plan is homemade trail mix.
Almonds , cherries, and cacao nibs are nutrient-dense ingredients that offer a wealth of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
Although chocolate is off-limits on Whole30, cacao nibs can be added to snacks and meals for a rich, chocolatey flavor without added sugar. Plus, this cocoa product is packed with  magnesium  and flavonoid antioxidants ( 17 ,  18 ).

22. Whole30-compliant packaged snacks
On the Whole30 website, a  helpful section  lists premade foods that are allowed when you don’t have the opportunity to make homemade snacks.
Some items on this list include:
Chomps  grass-fed meat sticks
DNX  free-range chicken bars
Tio  gazpacho
SeaSnax  roasted seaweed snacks
Remember that simple, Whole30-approved snacks like hard-boiled eggs, mixed nuts,  fruit , or trail mix can also be found at most convenience stores.

The bottom line
Although snacking is not recommended on  the Whole30 program , some people may choose to snack for a variety of reasons.
Typical snack foods like  granola bars , chips, and peanuts are banned on Whole30, but a variety of delicious, Whole30-friendly snacks can be easily prepared at home or purchased.
Trail mix, drinkable soups, spring rolls, deviled eggs, sprouted pumpkin seeds, and coconut-yogurt parfaits are just a few of the snacks that you can enjoy on the Whole30 program.
