The Mediterranean diet is considered one of the healthiest ways of eating, thanks to its emphasis on fresh and cooked vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, and small amounts of lean protein. But preparing Mediterranean-inspired meals may mean spending more time in the kitchen on meal prep than you’d like.
Meal delivery services can make it easy to follow the  Mediterranean diet  and add new healthy (and delicious) dishes to your meal times.
The following services offer the best variety, flavor, and value for Mediterranean diet meal delivery.

Why we love it:  Offering healthy, organic meals with high quality ingredients, Sunbasket is not only our top pick for Mediterranean meal delivery service but also our  favorite meal delivery service  overall. The ingredient quality and taste of the meals stand out in comparison with other services we tested.
How it works:  When building your box, you can choose healthy meals from several diet plans, including Mediterranean, paleo,  pescatarian , gluten-free, vegetarian, and diabetes-friendly.
Additionally, you can select ingredients you’d like to avoid, such as pork, dairy, and  added sugar .
The service offers meal kits, which include fresh ingredients and recipe cards, as well as Fresh & Ready meals, which are fully prepared dishes that can be heated and served. Each meal kit can serve two or four people, while the Fresh & Ready meals are single-serve.
Once you’ve selected your meal plan, you can choose your meals from the service’s full menu, which includes a variety of dishes suitable for the  Mediterranean diet .
Here are some examples of dishes on the Sunbasket Mediterranean menu:
One-Pot Chicken with Carrots, Potatoes, and Thyme
Salmon Tacos with Cabbage Slaw, Salsa Roja, and Chipotle Yogurt
Persian Herb Frittata with White Bean and  Barberry  Salad
“Each of Sunbasket’s recipes featured fresh ingredients and unique flavor combinations that stood out from other meal delivery services I’ve tried,” says former Healthline nutrition editor Kelli McGrane, MS, RD.
“There were plenty of appealing options on the Mediterranean menu, and all of the recipes took 30 minutes or less to prepare.”
Sunbasket also prioritizes sustainability by using  eco-conscious packaging . Detailed instructions on how to reuse, recycle, or compost each component of the packaging from your delivery are available online.
Sunbasket is a bit more costly than some other services, so it may not be the best choice if you’re on a tight budget. ( HelloFresh  is our pick for more budget-friendly meals — you just have to be a little more careful to make sure you select meals labeled for the Mediterranean diet.)
You can skip a week or cancel your subscription at any time online.

Meal type   Meal kit
HelloFresh is a popular meal kit company that has a large menu of healthy recipes, including a good selection of Mediterranean-inspired meals. It’s also generally more affordable than other services on our list.
How it works:  Though HelloFresh doesn’t have a specific menu for the Mediterranean diet, the service does label meals that are suitable for those following a Mediterranean diet.
Here are some examples of some of the Mediterranean diet recipes that HelloFresh offers:
Mushroom and Chive Risotto with Herb Butter
Pecan-Crusted Trout with Apple-Studded Salad and Thyme-Roasted Potatoes
Chicken Gyro Couscous Bowls with Hummus, Tomato Cucumber Salad, and Feta Sauce
Most HelloFresh packaging is recyclable, including the box, gel packs, liners, and separators. Information on how to recycle each component is available online.
The service makes it easy to cancel your subscription or skip a week at any time by logging into your account.
“All of the meals tasted great, and I’ve saved several of the recipes so that I can make them again,” says Healthline writer SaVanna Shoemaker.
Former Healthline nutrition editor Kelli McGrane has also used HelloFresh and agrees that the meals are flavorful overall and use a nice variety of textures. “ The Mediterranean Couscous bowls are [a] favorite and include a good mix of whole grains, vegetables, and chickpeas,” she says.
Two of our reviewers noted the lower cost of HelloFresh as a selling point and that it could be a good fit for families as well as individuals.
“ I think it’s a great option for families and for single people. It’s definitely cheaper than eating out and in many ways more convenient than making a trip to a grocery store and the attention it takes to think of recipes and source the ingredients,” says Healthline senior editor Candice Abellon.

Why we love it:  Green Chef is one of the few  USDA  Certified  Organic meal kits  available (meal kits with this seal use at least 95% organic ingredients). So, it’s a great choice if you’re looking for an easy way to follow a healthy, well-rounded Mediterranean diet while eating organic.
How it works:  Green Chef allows you to tailor your meal selections to fit a Mediterranean diet, with options also available for vegan, keto, and gluten-free diets. The service offers meal kits that include organic produce and proteins raised with high animal welfare standards.
When signing up with Green Chef, you can select your preferred meal types to find recipes suitable for vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, keto, paleo, or Mediterranean diets.
Here are some examples of meals on the Mediterranean menu:
Sun-Dried Tomato Flatbreads with Balsamic Reduction, Basil Pesto, and Kale Salad
Parmesan-Crusted Chicken with Marinated Tomatoes and Green Beans with Hazelnuts
Blackened Salmon with Dijonnaise and Couscous with Corn, Roasted Peppers, and Apricot-Glazed Green Beans
In addition to using recyclable packaging, Green Chef says it offsets 100% of carbon emissions from operations, so it’s a good option for eco-conscious consumers.
You can pause, skip, or cancel your weekly orders directly on the company’s website.
Green Chef is more expensive than many of its competitors, and most of the meals contain a relatively high number of calories per serving, which could be an important consideration if you’re  trying to lose weight .
“I really appreciated that all of Green Chef’s recipes were packed with fresh, flavorful vegetables,” says former Healthline nutrition editor Kelli McGrane, MS, RD.
“Each recipe’s ingredients were pre-chopped and individually packaged, so the meals took less time to prepare than most other meal delivery services I’ve tried.
“Green Chef’s diverse menu and quick recipes make it a convenient option for people who prefer to eat organic food. That said, it’s also a little more expensive than some other meal delivery services.”

Why we love it:   Home Chef  caters to families with its flavorful and kid-friendly meals. Its mix of meal kits and oven-ready options provides flexibility for busy weeknights, making it easy to enjoy Mediterranean-inspired dinners together.
How it works:  You can order 2–6 recipes per week with two, four, or six servings each. Once you’ve selected your meal plan, you can easily mix and match your favorite meals from the rotating weekly menu.
There’s also an option to filter recipes by meal or diet type, including calorie-conscious, carb-conscious, and ready in less than 30 minutes. Some meals are oven-ready, and you can customize others by swapping in different protein sources.
One thing of note: There are limited options for certain dietary patterns, including gluten-free and vegetarian.
Home Chef doesn’t allow you to filter for the Mediterranean diet. But here are some examples of dishes on the menu that fit into this diet:
Salmon and Poached Cherry Chutney with Crispy Potatoes and Lemon Broccoli
Cheesy BBQ Cauliflower Mini Flatbreads with Pickled Shallots
Chicken and Lemon Crema with Carrots
Home Chef uses packaging that’s mostly recyclable or reusable and provides information on how to recycle materials from your delivery on its website.
“Home Chef’s menu options are grouped by how long they take to prepare, and the ingredients are packaged by recipe to help streamline meal prep. I appreciated that it was easy for me to get dinner ready in just a few minutes,” says Healthline writer SaVanna Shoemaker.
“Overall, I found Home Chef to be a convenient, family-friendly option for weeknight dinners.”

Why we love it:  Territory Foods offers a wide assortment of fresh and nutritious meals prepared by chefs in your local area, including Mediterranean-inspired lunches, dinners, and side dishes.
How it works:  You can filter the menu to find options tailored to the Mediterranean diet. Territory also offers dishes that are keto-friendly, paleo, plant-based, low carb, and Whole30-approved.
You order dishes individually from the rotating weekly menu, and they’ll be delivered twice per week for local customers or once per week for national orders. Note that there’s a minimum order of four meals per delivery or eight meals per week, which may not be ideal for everyone.
Meals are individually packaged and available in two sizes: Standard Size and Boost Size. Boost Size is a smaller portion for light eaters.
Here are a few examples of meals on the Mediterranean menu:
Tagine Chicken Salad with Peppercorn Dressing
Okra and Chickpea Masala with Saffron Basmati Rice
Grilled Salmon with Cauliflower Rice and Broccoli
All the packaging Territory Foods uses is produced from recyclable or compostable materials. Detailed information on how to recycle each component is available on the company’s website.
Territory Foods offers one-time ordering or recurring weekly subscriptions and allows you to pause, change, or cancel your subscription online.
“The variety of meals is good, [they come] precooked, and looked and smelled fresh and appealing. They looked similar to prepared meals I might pick up from the deli area of a local grocery store,” says Healthline senior editor Candice Abellon.

Healthline score   4.1 out of 5
Why we love it:  BistroMD provides fully prepared frozen meals, which are a good alternative to meal kits if you’re looking for a simple way to follow the Mediterranean diet while saving time on cooking.
Note that the service offers some dishes with red meat, which you may want to avoid if you’re following the Mediterranean diet.
How it works:  When signing up, you can opt to receive either 5 or 7 days’ worth of meals per week, with either lunch and dinner only or all three meals per day.
The service offers several programs to choose from, and you can select meals that are gluten-free, heart-healthy, or tailored to people who have diabetes or are experiencing  menopause .
While BistroMD doesn’t offer a plan specifically for the Mediterranean diet, the full menu features more than 150 meals, including plenty of suitable options such as:
Grilled Salmon with Creamy Pesto
Chicken Meatballs with Lentils and Spiced Tomato Sauce
Mediterranean Quinoa Salad
BistroMD entrees are delivered in a recyclable cooler. The box, meal sleeves, bags, plastic trays, and insulation are also recyclable. It’s easy to pause or cancel your subscription by logging into your account on the website.
“Considering that the meals are premade and could be microwaved, I was impressed with their bold flavors,” says former Healthline editor Steven Rowe.
“The portions were really good. Because there was just the right amount, I always finished it and didn’t feel that ‘I ate too much’ feeling afterward. My wife and I found that we could almost get by having a full day’s worth of food for the two of us from just the one-person plan.”

Why we love it:  Featuring some of the freshest meals we’ve tested, Sprinly is a good option if you’re interested in adding more  whole, plant-based foods  to your diet.
How it works:  Each week, you can customize your order by building your own box with 6, 12, or 18 items.
Though the service does not offer any meal plans for specific diets, most items on the menu can easily be incorporated into a Mediterranean diet, such as:
Royal Beet Medallions with Ancient Quinoa and Greens
Pesto Pasta with Sun-dried Tomato Cakes and Spinach
Mediterranean Veggie Kofta Crumble with Vegan Tzatziki and Cucumber Tomato Salad
All of the packaging materials Sprinly uses are recyclable, compostable, or reusable and detailed instructions can be found online.
According to former Healthline nutrition editor and dietitian Kelli McGrane, “All of the meals were bursting with crunchy vegetables and chewy whole grains. Even the salad greens arrived and remained vibrant and fresh without getting wilty or soggy.
“In particular, I loved the pineapple sauce that came with the Sesame-Crusted Tofu and the Sunshine lemon dressing. The pesto was also bright and zesty.”
However, McGrane noted that despite changing weekly, the menu is limited to just six options per week. She also mentioned that because the service recommends heating the meals on a plate or in a bowl, it might not be the best option for office lunches.
McGrane concluded, “Overall, while it’s one of the more expensive meal delivery services, if it fits in your budget, the quality of the ingredients makes it well worth the splurge.”

Best for halal cuisine
Meal type   fully prepared
Price per serving   $9.99 to $12.49
Why we love it:  The Halal Meal Prep serves a wide variety of flavorful, Mediterranean-friendly meals, all of which are certified  halal  and fully prepared.
How it works:  When placing your order, you can browse the full menu and choose from an assortment of breakfasts, entrees, or snacks, with a minimum order of 10 meals per delivery.
Alternatively, you can purchase one of their meal plans, which includes 15 to 21 pre-selected meals each week. In addition to a low carb meal plan, the service offers plans targeted to various weight-related goals, such as weight loss, weight gain, or weight maintenance.
All meals are halal, meaning the company has modified traditional Mediterranean dishes to fit the requirements of a halal diet.
For example, on a Mediterranean halal diet, grilled chicken may be made with halal poultry, whereas paella would be made using halal meat and seafood.
Many of the meals that the service offers can easily fit into a Mediterranean halal meal plan, including:
Greek Gyro Platter
Parmesan Chicken Meatballs
Eggplant Parm
Healthline copy editor Jamie Elmer gave The Halal Meal Prep a try and found the ordering process simple and painless. “One thing I did like about the service was that you could see the menu fully and choose items before signing up,” she says.
She also appreciated the variety and flavors of the meals she sampled. “I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of meal types and ingredients,” says Elmer. “It was cool to see so many breakfast options, as well as foods with actual flavor – versus the usual chicken/rice/broccoli combo.”
Elmer notes that her order arrived quickly and in good condition, but also used quite a bit of packaging. For instance, each meal included two layers of plastic for the lids, “though these are reusable, microwavable, and dishwasher-safe if you wanted to keep them,” she says.

Mediterranean meal delivery services compared

How we test meal delivery services
At Healthline, we know that meal delivery services aren’t a small investment, which is why we’ve taken the time to test more than 30 of the most popular meal delivery services on the market.
Testers select a week’s worth of meals from multiple menus to get a well-rounded view of the types of flavors and ingredients offered.
During testing, we consider several factors, including the ease of the sign-up and meal selection process, the variety and nutritional composition of the meals offered, ingredient quality and freshness, how easy the meals are to cook, and, of course, the taste.
Additionally, each service we feature is in compliance with U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) food safety and manufacturing regulations, and uses a trusted shipper to handle its food products.

Benefits of the Mediterranean diet
Based on the consumption of unprocessed foods, including fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, fish, and heart-healthy fats, such as  olive oil , the  Mediterranean diet  is recognized as one of the healthiest ways to eat.
In fact, this diet is among those credited with helping people live healthier and far longer than average in so-called  blue zones  around the world.
Researchers have studied the Mediterranean diet  extensively  and found that it offers the following benefits:
It can improve  heart health  and may be tied to a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke.
It may help  prevent  certain chronic conditions and could be associated with a lower risk of premature death, cancer, and metabolic disease.
It may be as effective for  weight loss  as several other popular eating patterns, including low fat and low carb diets.
In addition to supporting weight loss and heart health in people with  type 2 diabetes , the Mediterranean diet may  improve  blood sugar regulation.
If you’re interested in learning more about the Mediterranean diet, check out this  article . You might also consider speaking with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian for additional guidance to adjust your overall diet.

How to choose the best Mediterranean diet meal delivery service
When  deciding which meal delivery service  is right for you, you may want to consider the following factors:
Menu:  Review the sample menu to determine whether there are options suitable for your dietary needs and food preferences.
Time and preparation required:  Though some services provide dishes that are fully cooked and prepared, others include basic ingredients and recipe cards to simplify meal prep and help you make your own  Mediterranean meals  at home.
Cost:  In addition to the price of each meal, you should account for other fees, including charges for shipping or optional add-ons.
Additionally, while all the services listed above include meals that can be enjoyed while following the Mediterranean diet, some make it easier than others to find suitable options. For example, while Sunbasket offers a Mediterranean diet meal plan, the others require you to determine whether a meal is a good fit.
Finally, keep in mind that not all meal delivery services are available in all areas. While all the services included in this article deliver to most areas within the contiguous United States, it’s always a good idea to double-check that a service is available in your zip code.

The Mediterranean diet has been  shown  to promote long-term weight loss and  prevent weight gain  in  many studies .
Some research has also shown that the Mediterranean diet may also be associated with short-term weight loss.
