Creatine, a substance naturally found in the body, has been shown to provide  several benefits  for exercise performance when taken as a supplement.
So what can creatine do for women specifically? While  creatine supplements  are not gender-specific, they have been  linked to improvements  for women specifically in the following areas, both before and after menopause:
strength
exercise performance
muscle mass
Furthermore,  early research  suggests that taking creatine supplements may have benefits for women outside the gym, including helping reduce  mental fatigue  and manage  depression .
There is no research suggesting creatine supplements need to be avoided by women, but keep in mind some may contain additional ingredients, such as piperine, that should be avoided by pregnant or nursing women or those taking certain medications.
Keep reading for our picks of the six best creatine supplements for women.

Unlike other creatine supplements on this list, Transparent Labs Creatine HMB contains additional ingredients that may help build muscle and strength, including  hydroxylmethylbutyrate (HMB) .

HMB is a substance that your body naturally produces. While more research is needed, it  may help  increase strength, muscle size, aerobic performance, and recovery.

This product also includes vitamin D, which may  help improve  lower limb strength. It also contains  BioPerine, or piperine . Piperine is the active ingredient in  black pepper  extract, which the company claims helps boost the absorption of nutrients, though  more research  is needed.

This creatine supplement is free from gluten, artificial colorings, and preservatives. However, the flavored versions contain the sweetener  stevia , which may have an aftertaste that some people dislike.

Transparent Labs Creatine HMB is certified by  Informed Choice . It’s also third-party tested by  Analytical Resource Laboratories , and certificates of analysis (COAs)  are available  on Transparent Labs’ website.

Best creatine for HIIT workouts
Form   powder
Available flavors   Unflavored, Green Apple
Certifications   third-party tested for purity and potency
Price   $$

In addition to creatine monohydrate, Genius Creatine includes several ingredients that may be beneficial for high intensity interval training (HIIT):
Beta-alanine:  This  amino acid  helps prevent lactate buildup in muscles, which in turn may enhance athletic performance and is particularly helpful during HIIT workouts.
AstraGin:  This supplement blend contains Panax notoginseng extract and  Astragalus membranaceus  extract. AstraGin’s website claims that it can improve energy levels and increase nutrient absorption in the body. However,  no studies  have confirmed this.
Turmeric:  Turmeric contains curcumin, a compound with anti-inflammatory properties that  may help  with exercise recovery.
Spirulina:  This type of  blue-green algae  has been  shown  to increase the time to fatigue in cardiovascular workouts. It may also support weight loss and fat loss when combined with an exercise program, according to  2018 research .



It’s important to note that beta-alanine can cause a harmless tingling sensation. However, this product contains just 1.6 grams (g), a dose that may be low enough to avoid the tingles.

On the other hand, benefits of  beta-alanine supplementation  have been shown at doses of 4 to 6 g, so there’s a possibility that this supplement may not contain a high enough dose to be effective.

Genius Creatine is sweetened with stevia and  monk fruit extract  and is free of artificial dyes and fillers.

According to the company, all Genius products are third-party tested for purity and potency. However, it has not disclosed the name of the testing organization.

Note:  Third-party testing in the comparison table refers to third-party testing for purity and potency of products.

How to choose a creatine supplement
When shopping for a creatine supplement, consider the following factors:
Third-party testing:  As there is a lack of regulation around dietary supplements, you might look for creatine supplements that are third-party tested by an independent organization, such as Informed Choice or NSF International,  to ensure purity and potency .
Safe for sport:  Competitive athletes should look for a product that’s certified free of substances banned in sports. Some examples of certifications to look for are  NSF Certified for Sport ,  Informed Sport , and  Labdoor Sport .
Form:  Look for a supplement that contains creatine monohydrate rather than a less effective form, such as creatine ethyl ester or creatine HCL.
Additional ingredients:  If you’d like the product to include more than just creatine, consider a product with research-backed ingredients such as  beta-alanine vitamin D HMB (beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate)
beta-alanine
vitamin D
HMB (beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate)
Type:  Consider whether you’d prefer taking capsules or buying a powder that you can mix into your protein shake or another beverage.

Why supplement with creatine?
Creatine  is a naturally occurring substance found in muscle cells that plays an  essential role  in energy production during exercise.
Although your body produces it naturally, creatine is also available in supplement form.
Creatine supplements have been  found  to help with exercise recovery and improve:
strength
power
muscle mass
anaerobic exercise capacity
Research  shows that creatine is generally safe and well tolerated.
However, if you are pregnant or nursing, it’s best to talk with a doctor before starting supplementation, as  research on its safety  is limited in these cases.
It’s also a good idea to check with a doctor before taking any new supplements if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.

Benefits of creatine for women
The  benefits of creatine  have been well researched. However, most of that research has involved male participants. Research has also  suggested  that women may not respond as strongly to supplementation as men.
Available research in women suggests that creatine may:
increase strength and bone density both before and after menopause
improve  exercise performance
reduce mental fatigue
help manage depression
Some  research  suggests that taking creatine during the menstrual cycle may also help reduce any of its negative effects on sleep and cognition.
Creatine may also help improve brain function during sleep deprivation. Researchers note that this may be especially beneficial for women, who are more susceptible to sleep disturbances during pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause.

Frequently asked questions
When you start taking creatine supplements, the typical recommendation is to typically consume larger doses initially during what’s known as the  loading phase .
Taking  20 to 25 grams (g) of creatine  per day for 5 to 7 days during a loading phase has been shown to help increase muscle stores of creatine.
Afterward, a daily dose of  3 to 5 g  is the recommendation for maintaining these stores. Keep in mind that these are guidelines for the general population.
Before taking creatine (or any other supplement), make sure to speak with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized dosing recommendations.

Some professionals recommend consuming creatine after exercising, as the post-exercise increase in blood flow may increase the rate at which creatine is delivered to your muscles.
Furthermore,  some studies  have shown an increase in lean muscle mass when people consume creatine after exercise.
However, research on the  optimal timing  of creatine supplementation is too limited and inconclusive to definitively say that post-workout ingestion is more effective.
Therefore, while the manufacturers of most products on this list recommend using the products after your gym session, it’s perfectly fine to add creatine powder to your pre-workout beverage if that works best for you.

Creatine is a very well-researched supplement. Currently, the only consistently reported  side effect  is  weight gain  in some individuals.
Weight gain may occur as a result of creatine’s ability to promote hydration in the body, meaning that any weight gain likely comes from small amounts of water retention. However, the overall research on water retention from creatine supplementation is mixed.
It’s also worth noting that  weight gain from creatine supplementation  typically affects men rather than women.
Overall, evidence shows that daily doses of  0.3 to 0.8 g  per kilogram of body weight are safe and well-tolerated.

There is no research on the use of creatine supplementation for weight loss in women.
However, as creatine can help promote muscle mass, it may be beneficial to take during weight loss to help  reduce the loss of lean body mass . This is important because  loss of muscle  is associated with an increased risk of:
injury
fatigue
decreased resting metabolic rate

A common belief is that creatine can increase levels of testosterone or  dihydrotestosterone  (DHT), a hormone that can contribute to issues like hair loss.
However, research  shows  that creatine supplementation does not increase testosterone or DHT and does not affect hair loss or baldness.

However, research  shows  that creatine supplementation does not increase testosterone or DHT and does not affect hair loss or baldness.
Research suggests that creatine may actually help lessen the effects of sleep deprivation.
According to a  2024 study , taking a single dose of creatine improved cognitive performance and processing speed in individuals with sleep deprivation.
Other studies have turned up similar findings, with researchers  noting  that creatine could be especially beneficial for women more susceptible to sleep deprivation.

Several kinds of creatine supplements are available, including  creatine ethyl ester  and  creatine HCL .

However, research suggests that  creatine monohydrate  is the most effective form. It has been shown to improve muscle creatine and phosphocreatine concentrations by  20% to 40% , allowing muscles to produce more energy during exercise.

The bottom line
Creatine supplements — and creatine monohydrate, in particular — may help improve strength, recovery time, and exercise performance and offer additional health benefits outside the gym.
However, as some products are better than others, make sure to look for a creatine supplement that is made with high quality ingredients and has undergone rigorous testing to ensure quality and accuracy.
Regardless of which product you choose, it’s important to talk with a healthcare professional before taking any new supplements.
Finally, while creatine supplements may enhance your nutritional intake, it’s important to remember that they’re not a replacement for a well-balanced diet.
