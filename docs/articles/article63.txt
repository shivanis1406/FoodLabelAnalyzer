Title: Electrolyte Water: Benefits and Myths

Electrolyte waters are enhanced with charged minerals. Electrolytes may help improve physical performance during exercise or help rehydrate you when you’re sick, among other benefits.
Whether you drink bottled or tap water, it most likely contains trace amounts of electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium.
However, the concentration of electrolytes in beverages may vary greatly. Some brands add a significant amount of minerals along with carbs and market their water as a sports drink, while others only add a negligible amount for taste.
This article discusses the potential benefits of electrolyte-enhanced water, as well as common myths surrounding it.

What Is Electrolyte Water?
Electrolytes are minerals that conduct electricity when dissolved in water.
They’re distributed through the fluid in your body and use their electrical energy to facilitate important bodily functions ( 1 ).
Electrolytes are essential for ( 2 ):
Controlling your fluid balance.
Regulating your blood pressure.
Helping your muscles contract — including your heart.
Maintaining the correct acidity of your blood (pH).
Common electrolytes include sodium, chloride, potassium,  magnesium  and calcium.
Electrolyte waters are enhanced with these charged minerals, but the concentrations vary.
Unless it’s labeled “ distilled ,” your regular bottled water provides at least a small amount of electrolytes, and many products contain trace amounts for taste.
Tap water has electrolytes as well. On average, 34 ounces (1 liter) of tap water contain 2–3% of the reference daily intake (RDI) for sodium, calcium and magnesium but little to no potassium ( 3 ).
In contrast, the same amount of popular electrolyte-enhanced sports drinks packs up to 18% of the RDI for sodium and 3% of the RDI for potassium but little to no magnesium or calcium ( 4 ).
Electrolytes are charged minerals important for maintaining optimal body functions. Common electrolyte beverages include enhanced waters and sports drinks.

May Improve Exercise Performance
Electrolyte-enhanced waters, particularly  sports drinks , may benefit athletes by helping replenish water, electrolytes and energy lost during exercise.
During physical activity, you need additional fluids to replace the water lost in sweat. In fact, a water loss of as little as 1–2% of your body weight can lead to decreased strength, speed and focus ( 5 ,  6 ).
Sweat also contains electrolytes, including a significant amount of sodium, as well as small amounts of potassium, calcium and magnesium. On average, you lose around 1 gram of sodium with every liter of sweat ( 5 ).
Sports drinks are recommended over plain water to replace fluid and electrolytes if you tend to sweat a lot, exercise longer than one hour or in hot environments ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
You should note that sports drinks are designed for athletes, not sedentary individuals. Along with electrolytes, they contain calories from added sugar. In fact, a 20-ounce (591-ml) bottle of Gatorade packs a whopping 30 grams of sugar ( 4 ).
Sports drinks are designed for athletes and contain electrolytes along with carbs to replenish the nutrients lost through sweating. They’re recommended for prolonged exercise and exercise in hot weather.

Can Rehydrate During Illness
In the short term, vomiting and diarrhea are usually not serious conditions. However, severe or persistent symptoms can quickly lead to dehydration if fluids and electrolytes are not replaced.
Infants and children are especially vulnerable to dehydration from severe vomiting and diarrhea. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends using an oral rehydration solution at the first signs of illness to prevent dehydration ( 8 ).
Oral rehydration solutions contain water, carbs and electrolytes in specific proportions that are easy to digest. A popular example is Pedialyte.
Sports drinks are similar but contain  higher amounts of sugar . They’re not recommended for infants and young children, as they may worsen diarrhea ( 9 ).
Sports drinks may be tolerated by older children if diluted to 1 part water, 1 part sports drink. Adults typically tolerate both oral rehydration solutions and sports drinks without issues ( 8 ,  9 ).
Importantly, electrolyte beverages may not be sufficient for treating severe dehydration. If diarrhea lasts more than 24 hours or if you’re unable to keep fluids down, seek medical advice ( 10 ,  11 ).
Illnesses, such as vomiting and diarrhea, can cause you to lose fluid and electrolytes rapidly. Oral rehydration solutions are recommended for replenishment.

Can Help Prevent Heat Stroke
Hot environments put you at risk for a variety of heat-related illnesses, which range from mild heat rash to life-threatening heatstroke.
Normally, your body manages heat by releasing it through your skin and by sweating. However, this cooling system may begin to fail in hot weather, causing your body temperature to rise to dangerously high levels ( 10 ).
The key to preventing heat-related illnesses is to limit your time in the heat. However, getting  plenty of fluid  and electrolytes is also extremely important to help your body stay cool ( 11 ).
In hot environments, water and sports drinks are recommended for hydration over other beverages. Drinks containing caffeine such as soda, coffee and tea may worsen dehydration, as can alcohol (12).
Prolonged exposure to heat puts you at risk for heatstroke. Consuming adequate amounts of fluids and electrolytes is recommended to help your body stay cool.

Electrolyte vs Regular Water
Adequate hydration is  essential for overall health . Water is necessary for virtually all body functions, including transporting nutrients, regulating body temperature and flushing out waste and toxins ( 2 ).
Both electrolyte and regular water count towards your daily fluid needs, as do other beverages such as  coffee , tea, fruit juices and milk.
It’s a common misperception that electrolyte water is superior to regular water for hydration. In reality, it depends on the circumstances.
More specifically, electrolyte water may be beneficial if you’re at risk for quick losses of minerals. You may want to consider an electrolyte-enhanced beverage if:
You’re exercising for more than one hour ( 6 ).
You sweat heavily during exercise ( 5 ,  7 ).
You’re ill with vomiting or diarrhea ( 8 ).
You will be exposed to heat for longer periods ( 5 , 12).
Outside of sports, hot weather and illness, regular water works just fine to meet your day-to-day hydration needs.
Though electrolyte water may have benefits under certain circumstances, regular water is sufficient for meeting your general hydration needs.

Electrolyte Water Is Easy to Make
Making electrolyte water is a cost-effective and healthy way to replace fluid and electrolytes when needed.
Here is an easy lemon-lime sports drink recipe to try at home:
Yield:  4 cups (946 ml)
Serving size:  1 cup (237 ml)
Ingredients:
1/4 tsp of salt
1/4 cup (60 ml) of lemon juice
1/4 cup (60 ml) of lime juice
1 1/2 cups (360 ml) of unsweetened  coconut water
2 cups (480 ml) of cold water
Unlike store-bought versions, this recipe provides a refreshing boost of electrolytes without  added sugar  or any artificial colors or flavors.

The Bottom Line
Electrolyte water is enhanced with minerals your body needs to function optimally, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium and chloride.
While it’s unnecessary to drink electrolyte-enhanced beverages all the time, they may be beneficial during prolonged exercise, in hot environments or if you’re ill with vomiting or diarrhea.
Sports drinks and other electrolyte waters can be pricey, so you may want to consider a homemade version. Not only are these cheap to make, but they provide electrolytes without artificial colors or flavors.
