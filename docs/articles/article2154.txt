Title: Ritual Vitamins Reviewed by Dietitians and Tested by Editors

We vetted Ritual’s full line of supplements and took them for a spin, including the company’s protein powders, prenatal vitamins, multivitamins, and probiotics. Here’s what we thought.
Ritual offers a variety of multivitamins, protein powders, and other supplements made from simple, high quality ingredients. It’s become one of the most popular supplement brands since launching in 2016, thanks to its transparency and traceable ingredients.
However, Ritual products are more expensive than many similar supplements. So are they worth the hype?
Our team of dietitians, editors, and freelance contributors have vetted Ritual’s offerings and tried its multivitamins, prenatal vitamins, protein powders, and Synbiotic+ to answer just that.
We’ve found the supplements to have many benefits — Synbiotic+ is one of  our favorite probiotics . When it comes to some of the multivitamins and prenatal formulations, there are more comprehensive options on the market.
If you’re looking to fill larger gaps in your diet, you might look elsewhere, but if you eat a well-rounded diet already, Ritual supplements are a great option, especially when looking for supplements customized for age and stage of life.

Ritual at a glance
Ritual’s supplements are tailored to your age, sex, and stage of life, including pregnancy and while breastfeeding.
Some of the ways that Ritual stands out against competitors include:
Transparency:  Ritual provides detailed information on how and where the ingredients in its products are sourced, along with the science behind why they are used in each formulation.
Quality testing:  According to the company, all Ritual products are tested for heavy metals, contaminants, and label accuracy by an independent lab, and some are certified by third-party organizations, including  United States Pharmacopeia (USP)  and  Informed Sport .
Delayed-release capsules:  The company’s multivitamins are made using delayed-release capsules, which are  designed  to dissolve in your small intestine rather than your stomach. According to Ritual, this is gentler on your stomach, meaning you don’t have to pair your multivitamin with meals.
Beadlet-in-oil design:  Each capsule combines both oily and dry ingredients, which are usually separate in other supplements. This makes it easy to get a variety of  nutrients your body needs  in a single dose.

Unlike many other Ritual supplements, the Essential for Women Multivitamin 18+ includes  iron . Women of childbearing age  require more  iron because of increased losses during menstruation.
The supplement is also third-party certified by USP.
Just keep in mind that because the supplement is designed to fill common gaps in the diet, Ritual Essential for Women Multivitamin 18+ isn’t as comprehensive as many other  women’s multivitamins .

“I’ve tried several multivitamin supplements, and I was overall impressed by Ritual Essential for Women Multivitamin 18+. The pills were easy to swallow and were surprisingly pretty to look at thanks to the beadlet-in-oil technology.

“As someone who doesn’t eat fish on a regular basis, I also appreciated having a multivitamin that contains omega-3 DHA. Plus, while some online reviewers complain about a fishy burps, I found that the minty-fresh flavor masked any fishiness.”

The Essential for Women Multivitamin 50+ contains several essential micronutrients to support healthy aging after menopause, including vitamin D3, which is necessary for  maintaining  strong bones and increasing calcium absorption.
However, it’s worth noting that the supplement isn’t formulated to manage common menopause symptoms. It’s also not as comprehensive as many other options for  women over 50 years .
“ I was surprised by how much I liked the brand right away. Admittedly, I’m a sucker for presentation, and I found the clean, modern packaging with its see-through bottle and speckled gel caps to be fresh and unique.
“I was not at all prepared for the alluring peppermint scent that wafted from the bottle when I opened it. I immediately went on the Ritual website to find out what the deal was, and found out the source is their Minty Tab, a food-grade plastic insert infused with essential oil. It may sound like a small thing, but honestly it made the experience of taking my daily capsule so much more appealing.
“Packaging aside, I liked taking Ritual multivitamins. The daily dose is two capsules, which were incredibly easy to take with or without food. I took them in the morning and felt calm yet energized consistently throughout the day. As a coffee drinker, I noticed that my caffeine jitters were very subdued.
“As someone who gets a lot of nutrients from the food I eat, I wasn’t look for anything out of the ordinary in a supplement. However, my doctor had recommended that I take B12, which this has, since my levels were a bit low and it’s important for brain health as you age. I also like the inclusion of vitamin D and Omega-3 DHA.
“As a basic, streamlined supplement, this ticked a lot of the essential boxes for me. It has ingredients that help with heart health, bones, muscle function, and immune support. It is very easy and downright enjoyable to take. And the website has all the information you could possibly want at your fingertips.
“I also really appreciated the brand’s dedication to transparency and quality ingredients. Knowing what’s actually IN your multivitamin is incredibly reassuring.”

Ritual provides two multivitamins designed specifically for men, including this option for men over 18 years of age and a formulation for  men 50 years and older .

Both multivitamins contain omega-3 fatty acids sourced from  microalgae , which  may help support  heart health, reduce inflammation, and enhance brain function.

Each supplement also provides a hearty dose of  zinc , which is  important  for immunity, wound healing, protein synthesis, and more.
The Essential for Men Multivitamin 18+ currently costs $33 a bottle, while the  Essential for Men Multivitamin 50+  costs $39 for a 1-month supply.


“I had been experiencing mild anemia due to a bleeding ulcer prior to taking these vitamins, and the B12 and folate content seemed to help bring my hemoglobin and iron levels back closer to the normal range during the 90-day test period. A wider range of nutrients would be nice though. Most multivitamins provide more than the eight this one supplies.
“As someone with Celiac disease, I did appreciate that these capsules were gluten free (they are also vegan).
“[The] capsules were soft and easily digested compared to other vitamins I’ve taken. They are available on Amazon, at Target, and via several other mail-order outlets.”

Ritual’s prenatal vitamin provides an array of essential nutrients both before and during pregnancy.

For instance, it includes folate, which  can protect  against neural tube development issues, and  choline , a micronutrient that can  improve  pregnancy outcomes.

One mom  who tested the product  found that she had much more energy while taking the Ritual prenatal during her third pregnancy than she had while taking a generic prenatal during her first two pregnancies.

Just keep in mind that this supplement provides only 10% of the daily value (DV) for choline during pregnancy. Therefore, it’s important to include choline-rich foods, such as eggs, in your diet.
If you feel you have more dietary gaps in your diet or have a lot of food aversions during your pregnancy, you might want to choose a more comprehensive prenatal like  FullWell  or  Perelel .

In case you’re not getting enough choline from your diet, Ritual makes a protein powder for pregnancy and the postpartum period that contains additional choline.


“I appreciated the convenience of the subscription model and like that the ingredients are higher quality compared to many other more mainstream, drugstore brands.

“On a few occasions, I’ve experienced the infamous ‘fishy burps’ that can come with taking a DHA supplement. But overall, I found the taste and smell to be quite neutral and not overpowering.
“I wound up switching to FullWell’s prenatal knowing it was more comprehensive, but it’s also more expensive, and you have to purchase a separate fish oil supplement.

“Overall, I’d recommend Ritual to anyone looking for a prenatal with traceable ingredients and who already eats a pretty well-rounded diet.”

With 20 grams (g) of  plant-based protein  in each serving, Ritual’s protein shakes can help you squeeze more protein into your diet.
They also contain several essential nutrients, including choline, calcium, and iron, making them a good complement to Ritual’s multivitamins.


Both are free of sugar, stevia, soy, gluten, or GMOs. They are also naturally flavored with vanilla and sweetened with fermented sugarcane and  monk fruit .
Plus, the shakes are Informed Sport Certified, meaning competitive athletes can rest assured that the powders are free from substances banned in sport.
Finally, it’s worth noting that the Daily Shake 50+ contains calcium  beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) , a compound that may help  increase  muscle mass and  improve  strength and physical function in older adults.


“I’ve tried countless protein powders over the years and am pretty picky about the taste and texture. Ritual Essential Protein Daily Shake 18+ had a thicker consistency than many other powders that I’ve tried, and I appreciate that it’s Informed Sport Certified.

“However, the texture was a bit gritty and took a long time to smooth out using a shaker bottle. I also found the vanilla flavor to taste artificial, though it didn’t leave a bad aftertaste.

“While it’s not my favorite protein powder, nutritionally, I think it’s a solid option for people looking to add a boost of protein and essential nutrients to their morning smoothie.”

Ritual Daily Shake Pregnancy & Postpartum provides an added boost of choline (45% of the DV), making it a good option to pair with the company’s prenatal and postnatal vitamins.
As with Ritual’s other protein powders, this supplement is vanilla-flavored, free of added sugars, and contains 20 g of filling pea-based protein.
“I found the Essential Protein Daily Shake Pregnancy & Prenatal to be a super helpful part of my daily routine during my first pregnancy.

“I was trying to eat a mostly plant-based diet at the time, so I chose this powder because it still provides a complete amino acid profile with that extra boost of choline for pregnancy.

“It blends well into a simple smoothie with fruit, and I feel reassured that the ingredients are traceable and high quality.

“My only complaint is that I wish it came in a tub or jar type of container instead of a bag. The powder gets messy scooping it out of the bag each time (it always gets on my hands), and the seal isn’t the easiest to re-close.”

Designed to support gut health, enhance immune function, and relieve digestive issues like gas and bloating, Ritual’s Synbiotic+ is a 3-in-1 supplement that features prebiotics, probiotics, and a  postbiotic .

Each capsule provides 11 billion colony-forming units with two strains of  probiotics , Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG) and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis (BB-12), both of which have been studied for their ability to  boost  immune function and  support  digestive health.

It also contains PreforPro, a blend of prebiotics, and tributyrin, a type of postbiotic. In addition to probiotics, both prebiotics and postbiotics can  help support  the health of the gut microbiome.

Plus, this product is shelf-stable and made with a delayed-release capsule to optimize absorption.


“As someone who struggled with digestive health for years and still experiences digestive issues occasionally, I was excited to try Synbiotic+ as a possible replacement for the expensive pre- and probiotic supplements that I was taking.

“While I’ve only been taking it for less than 1 month, I’ve already noticed success with Synbiotic+.

“The capsule has a peppermint taste that’s much better than other supplements I’ve tried, and I appreciate the company’s transparency around its ingredient sourcing and quality measures. Plus, having a pre-, pro-, and postbiotic in one fell swoop is awesome.

“I’d highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to support their gut health without needing to take multiple pills.”

Ritual’s HyaCera supplement is formulated to promote skin hydration and reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.

Each once-daily, vanilla-essenced capsule contains two ingredients, including wheat oil extract and  sodium hyaluronate , the sodium salt form of hyaluronic acid.

One 12-week study showed that applying a hyaluronic acid cream  significantly reduced  wrinkles and improved skin condition in adults compared with a placebo.

An animal study  found  that wheat oil extract could also improve skin barrier function and prevent ultraviolet-induced skin damage, though these results haven’t been confirmed in humans.

Note that this product is not suitable for those with an allergy to wheat. However, it is considered gluten-free because of the processing methods used.

Other things to know about Ritual
Ritual’s multivitamins and  postnatal vitamins  contain a mint flavor tab, and the prenatal multivitamin is available with a lemon tab. Users often comment that they appreciate the flavoring, noting that they masks the normal vitamin taste.
However, even with the flavor tab, and although Ritual vitamins derive omega-3 fatty acids from microalgae rather than fish, many reviewers comment on a distinct fish-like flavor in products.
Ritual protein powders are available only in a vanilla flavor, which are free of sugar, stevia, and  sugar alcohols . And while reviewers report that the powders blend well, many find the taste and texture unpalatable. Blending the protein powder with other nutrient-dense ingredients, like fresh fruit or nut butter, may help.
Ritual multivitamins employ a time-release design that  dissolves  in the small intestine rather than the stomach to prevent  nausea .
The brand’s prenatal vitamins are also available with a citrus-flavored tab, which is believed to be  beneficial  for reducing  morning sickness  and nausea during pregnancy.
Ritual is a  subscription-based  service, meaning you must set up a monthly subscription to purchase products. You can also choose from discounted bundles or create your own monthly bundle by mixing and matching your favorite products.
Monthly subscriptions include free shipping and a 30-day money-back guarantee.
You can easily change your delivery date or cancel your subscription at any time directly on the company’s website.
All Ritual products — both the multivitamins and the protein powders — are intended to be taken once per day.
The dosage for most of the multivitamins is two capsules per day, which can be taken without meals. However, the dosage for the  multivitamin for kids  is three gummies per day, and the dosage for the Synbiotic+ and HyaCera supplements is one capsule per day.
Ritual’s protein powders should be combined with 8 ounces (oz) to 12 oz (237 milliliters [mL] to 355 mL) of any liquid and enjoyed as part of a balanced diet.

Customer reviews and brand reputation
Ritual is accredited by the  Better Business Bureau (BBB) . While the company currently has a 1.29-star rating from 21 customer reviews on the BBB, Ritual currently holds an A+ rating, which is based on factors like the company’s complaint history and business practices.
Online reviewers generally appreciate the simple list of ingredients in Ritual products, as well as the transparency regarding sourcing and suppliers.
Many like that each capsule contains an array of  important nutrients , eliminating the need to take several supplements each day or purchase multiple products.
However, because the capsules contain omega-3 fatty acids, many reviewers note that the taste is unpleasant and report experiencing side effects like “fishy burps” after taking the multivitamin.
Some dislike the flavor of the protein powders, saying the powder should be blended with other ingredients to mask the taste.
A few reviewers also report experiencing issues with deliveries, recurring monthly subscriptions, and the responsiveness of customer service.

Potential downsides
While Ritual has many positive aspects, there are a few potential downsides to consider:
Price:  Ritual products can be more expensive than some similar supplements, which may not make them a great choice for cost-conscious consumers or people on a tight budget.
Subscription:  Ritual supplements require a monthly subscription, which might not be suitable for people who prefer having more flexibility to purchase products only as needed.
Personalization:  Though Ritual offers products for men and women in a wide age range, the company doesn’t offer personalized bundles or supplements.
Nutritional needs:  Some Ritual supplements don’t contain certain nutrients that some people might want or need, such as iron, calcium, or  vitamin C . Additionally, Ritual’s prenatal vitamin is low in choline, so pregnant people should make sure they’re consuming enough  choline-rich foods .
If a healthcare professional has recommended that you take a multivitamin or supplement with specific nutrients, you should discuss with them whether a Ritual product contains the right ingredients and amounts for you before purchasing.

Alternatives to Ritual
If you’re looking for a subscription-based vitamin company, there are a couple others to consider.

These products are also formulated with flavor tabs and are made to dissolve in the small intestine rather than the stomach to help prevent this effect. While this doesn’t guarantee you won’t experience side effects like fishy burps, it may make it less likely.

The bottom line
Ritual offers a variety of multivitamins and protein powders that help make it easy to meet your  nutritional needs .
The monthly subscription plan may be a good fit for you if you value convenience, transparency, and third-party testing or have difficulty tolerating other multivitamins.
On the other hand, it might not be ideal if you are on a tight budget, prefer having more options for personalization, or need a more comprehensive multivitamin.
To determine whether Ritual is right for you, consider the factors above and talk with a trusted healthcare professional.
