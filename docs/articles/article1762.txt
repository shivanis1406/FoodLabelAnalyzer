Title: 4 Natural Ways to Get Rid of Pimples as Fast as Possible

Some people use herbal remedies, including essential oils like tea tree oil, green tea, and aloe vera, to get rid of pimples quickly.
Acne is a common skin disease that affects an estimated 85% of people at some point in their lives.
Symptoms include pesky pimples that can be frustrating and difficult to get rid of.
While conventional treatments can get rid of pimples, they’re often associated with adverse effects, such as skin irritation and dryness.
As such, a lot of people have turned to natural alternatives to get rid of pimples fast. However, while there are a lot of natural acne remedies out there, only a handful are scientifically proven to help.
Here are 4 natural ways to get rid of pimples fast, although they may have limited research supporting their effectiveness for this purpose.

1. Spot treat with tea tree oil
Tea tree oil is extracted from the leaves of the tree  Melaleuca alternifolia , which is native to Australia.
It’s well known for its ability to fight bacteria and reduce skin inflammation. Specifically,  tea tree oil  helps fight  P. acnes  and  S. epidermidis , two types of bacteria that can cause pimples ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
One study found that 5% tea tree oil gel was almost four times more effective at reducing acne lesions and almost six times more effective at reducing acne severity than a placebo ( 4 ).
In another study, a gel containing 5% tea tree oil was proven equally effective at reducing pimples as a lotion containing 5% benzoyl peroxide, a common acne medication ( 5 ).
The tea tree oil treatment also resulted in fewer adverse effects, including dryness, irritation, and burning.
It’s important to note that tea tree oil is very potent and can cause redness and irritation when applied directly to the skin. For this reason, it should be diluted with a  carrier oil .
According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, only a small amount of research has been conducted on the topical use of tea tree oil for health conditions, and a limited amount of research indicates that tea tree oil might be helpful for acne ( 6 ).
If you choose to try please it, use it safely and always perform a test patch on your skin, as tea tree oil can be very irritating and should never be applied undiluted to the skin.
Combine 1 drop of tea tree oil with 1 teaspoon carrier oil.
Dip a cotton swab into the mixture and apply it directly to pimples.
Apply moisturizer, if desired.
Repeat this process 1–2 times per day, as needed.
Tea tree oil fights inflammation and acne-causing bacteria. Applying it to the skin has shown that it may reduce pimples in some instances.

2. Spot treat with other essential oils
In addition to tea tree oil, many other essential oils with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties can help clear up pimples quickly.
A large scientific review found that essential oils of cinnamon, rose, lavender, and clove fight the acne-causing bacteria  S. epidermidis  and  P. acnes  ( 7 ).
Rosemary and lemongrass were also shown to inhibit  P. acnes  ( 8 ).
One study compared the acne-fighting abilities of clove-basil oil, 10% benzoyl peroxide, and a placebo. Both the 2% and 5% clove-basil oils were found to be more effective and faster at reducing pimples than benzoyl peroxide ( 9 ).
Another study found that a gel containing acetic acid, orange, and sweet basil essential oils resulted in a 75% increase in the healing rate of pimples ( 10 ).
Like tea tree oil, these  essential oils  are very concentrated and can cause irritation if applied directly to the skin. Be sure to dilute all essential oils with a carrier oil, perform a test patch before regular use, and discontinue use should irritation develop.
Combine 10 drops of essential oil with 1 ounce (30 mL) of carrier oil.
Dip a cotton swab into the mixture and apply it directly to pimples.
Apply moisturizer, if desired.
Repeat this process 1–2 times per day, as needed.

Other essential oils including cinnamon, rose, lavender, clove, and rosemary have been found to inhibit acne-causing bacteria. Applying these oils to the skin may help reduce pimples.

3. Apply green tea to the skin
A lot of people drink green tea for  its health benefits , but it can also be helpful when applied directly to the skin.
Green tea contains flavonoids and tannins, which are known to help fight inflammation and the bacteria that may cause pimples ( 11 ,  12 ).
It’s also high in the antioxidant epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which has been shown to fight inflammation, reduce sebum production, and inhibit the growth of  P. acnes  in people with acne-prone skin ( 13 ).
Multiple studies have shown that people with acne experience significantly less sebum production and pimples when they apply a 2–3% green tea extract to their skin ( 14 ,  15 ,  16 ).
There are a handful of skin care products on the market that contain green tea, but it’s very simple and cost-effective to make your own mixture at home.
Steep green tea in boiling water for 3–4 minutes.
Allow the tea to cool.
Apply it to your face with a cotton ball or spritz it on using a spray bottle.
Leave it on for 10 minutes or overnight, and then rinse your face with water.
Apply 1–2 times per day, as needed. It can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
Green tea is high in antioxidants that help reduce inflammation and fight bacteria. Applying it to the skin has been shown to significantly reduce pimples.

4. Moisturize with aloe vera
Aloe vera  is a tropical plant with leaves that produce a clear gel.
When applied to the skin, aloe vera gel has been shown to help fight bacteria, reduce inflammation, and promote wound healing ( 17 ,  18 ,  19 ).
Because of this, it’s a popular treatment for a variety of skin conditions, including  psoriasis , rashes, cuts, and burns.
There are limited studies on the ability of aloe vera to fight pimples specifically, but existing research is promising.
Aloe vera contains lupeol, salicylic acid, urea nitrogen, cinnamonic acid, phenols, and sulfur, all of which inhibit bacteria that might cause pimples ( 19 ,  20 ).
In one study, varying concentrations of aloe vera gel were added to a clove-basil oil and evaluated for anti-acne properties. The higher the concentration of aloe vera in the lotion, the more effective it was at reducing pimples ( 21 ).
Another study found that using 50% aloe vera gel with tretinoin cream was significantly more effective at clearing up pimples than tretinoin cream alone.  Tretinoin  cream is an acne medication derived from vitamin A ( 22 ).
Although aloe vera gel on its own was not effective at treating pimples, it enhanced the anti-acne effects of clove-basil oil and tretinoin cream.
While aloe vera gel may help clear up pimples on its own, it may be more effective when combined with other remedies or medications.
Scrape the gel out of the aloe leaves with a spoon.
Apply the gel to your skin when you apply other acne treatments. You may want to try mixing it with your other treatment, and then apply this to your skin. Or, you can apply the other acne treatment first, adding the aloe gel over it.
Repeat 1–2 times per day, or as desired.
Applying aloe to the skin can help treat burns, heal wounds, and fight inflammation. It has been shown to increase the anti-acne effects of other treatments, but more research is needed on its effects when used on its own.

Longer-term acne remedies
Several other natural acne treatments have been shown to be effective with consistent, long-term use.
Although the remedies below might not get rid of pimples quickly, they can help prevent and heal acne over time.
The mineral  zinc  plays a role in wound healing and can help reduce inflammation.
As such, it has been studied as a possible treatment for pimples.
Research has indicated that people with acne tend to have lower levels of zinc in their blood than those with clear skin ( 23 ).
Taking a zinc supplement has been shown to help. In fact, several studies have found that taking 30–45 mg of elemental zinc per day can significantly reduce pimples ( 24 ,  25 ,  26 ).
In one particular study, 48 people with acne took zinc supplements 3 times per day. After 8 weeks, 38 of them experienced an 80–100% reduction in pimples ( 27 ).
Zinc is available in many forms, each containing a different amount of elemental zinc.
Regardless of what form you choose, it’s probably best not to take more than the recommended upper limit of 40 mg of zinc per day.
Taking  too much zinc  may cause adverse effects, including stomach pain and gut irritation ( 28 ).

A specific strain of brewer’s yeast called  Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hansen CBS  also seems to help decrease pimples when consumed by mouth.
Brewer’s yeast tends to be a good source of B vitamins, chromium, copper, iron, and zinc. However, its ability to treat pimples is most likely due to its antibacterial effects ( 29 ,  30 ).
One study compared the effectiveness of brewer’s yeast with that of a placebo over 5 months.
Pimples were healed or considerably improved in more than 80% of people taking the yeast preparation, while only 26% of people saw improvement in the placebo group ( 31 ).
Studies have shown brewer’s yeast to have no side effects, but a few people have reported mild gas, bloating, or headaches after consuming it.

Fish oils  contain the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA).
Studies show that consuming EPA can help manage oil production, prevent pimples, and help the skin maintain adequate hydration ( 32 ,  33 ).
High levels of EPA and DHA have also been shown to decrease factors that contribute to inflammation, which may ultimately reduce the risk of pimples ( 34 ).
In one study, taking  omega-3 fatty acid supplements  containing both EPA and DHA daily for 10 weeks significantly reduced pimples in all 45 participants ( 35 ).
You can also get omega-3 fatty acids by eating walnuts, chia seeds, ground flaxseeds, salmon, sardines, and anchovies.
However, the plant sources above contain the omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and little to no EPA or DHA ( 36 ).
Taking a supplement with concentrated omega-3s can help you take in higher amounts of EPA and DHA to better treat pimples.

Taking brewer’s yeast, zinc, or fish oil orally may help prevent and reduce pimples over time. These supplements may not get rid of pimples quickly, but studies evaluating their long-term use show great promise.

Other ways to help reduce pimples
Although people have been using natural acne remedies for years, research on the topic is still emerging.
The remedies listed below may benefit acne-prone skin, but no studies exist on their ability to treat pimples:
Witch hazel.  Applying  witch hazel  to the skin has been shown to fight bacteria and reduce inflammation, which could help prevent pimples ( 37 ,  38 ).
Apple cider vinegar . The organic acids in  apple cider vinegar  may help kill acne-causing bacteria and reduce the appearance of scars ( 39 ,  40 ,  41 ,  42 ).
Limit dairy intake . Two large studies reported that people who drank more milk tended to have more pimples, but more research is needed ( 43 ,  44 ).
Try a honey and cinnamon mask .  Honey and cinnamon  have antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties, so they may benefit acne-prone skin when applied to it ( 45 ,  46 ).
Reduce stress . Some studies have linked stress to an increase in acne severity. Ask your healthcare provider about relaxation techniques and lifestyle changes that might help you  reduce your stress levels  ( 47 ,  48 ).
For even more tips, here are  13 powerful home remedies to get rid of acne .
A few other remedies may help you fight pimples naturally, including applying apple cider vinegar to the skin, limiting your dairy intake, and reducing stress levels. However, these have little or no research behind them, so more studies are needed.

The bottom line
Pimples are a common problem that can be frustrating to treat.
Conventional treatments can cause redness, dryness, or irritation, and many natural alternatives just don’t seem to work.
The home remedies listed in this article are supported by some limited studies as the most effective, natural ways to reduce pimples.
Nevertheless, applying various essential oils, green tea, and aloe vera to the skin seems to be the quickest way to get rid of pimples, while supplements may require longer-term use according to some limited research.
The remedies in this article might not work for everyone but could be worth a try.
Note that the American Academy of Dermatology’s guidelines for the treatment of acne assert that there’s not enough research on the safety and efficacy of herbal and other complementary therapies to recommend their use. This statement is inclusive of all remedies noted in this article.
If you live with severe acne, you may still want to consult a dermatologist. You can book an appointment with a dermatologist in your area using our  Healthline FindCare tool .
