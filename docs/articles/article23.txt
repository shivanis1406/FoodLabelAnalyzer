Title: The 16 Healthiest Salty Snacks

Humans naturally consider salt and salty foods highly palatable, which is why most people like to enjoy a salty snack now and then ( 1 ).
Even though enjoying an occasional salty snack is perfectly healthy for most people, some may need to limit their salt intake to manage certain medical conditions, including kidney disease and high blood pressure ( 2 ,  3 ).
While salty foods can be a part of your diet, it’s best to avoid highly processed, salt-laden foods like fast food, flavored chips, and boxed mac and cheese.
Fortunately for salt lovers, various nutritious salty snacks can be used to satisfy salty cravings.
This article lists 16 healthy salty snacks.

1. Salted macadamia nuts
Salted  macadamia nuts  are the perfect combination of a creamy, crunchy texture and salty taste that’s sure to satisfy your salt cravings.
In addition to being pleasingly salty, salted macadamia nuts are packed with nutrients like healthy fats, protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals ( 4 ).
Macadamia nuts are especially rich in  manganese , a mineral that’s essential for the health of your bones, metabolism, nervous and immune systems, and reproductive hormone function.
It also acts as an antioxidant, protecting the body’s cells from damage ( 4 ,  5 ).
You can pair macadamia nuts with a piece of fruit for a balanced sweet and salty snack.

2. Sardines
Sardines  are one of the most nutrient-dense foods you can eat. Plus, they’re salty.
Sardines are rich in vitamins B12 and D, calcium, iron, and selenium. They’re also an excellent source of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fats ( 6 ).
People who consume diets rich in  omega-3 fats  tend to be at a lower risk of developing heart disease and dying from heart-related ailments ( 7 ,  8 ).
Enjoy sardines alongside some veggies or crackers for some crunch.

3. Homemade sweet potato chips
Evidence suggests that frequently eating fried foods like potato chips isn’t good for your overall health and may increase your disease risk ( 9 ,  10 ).
Fortunately, there are  healthier alternatives  when you get a hankering for salty potato chips.
For example, baking nutrient-dense sweet potato chips at low heat will result in crispy, homemade chips that will satisfy your salt craving.
Slice sweet potatoes into thin rounds, coat them with olive oil, then sprinkle them with sea salt and bake them at 250°F (121°C) for 2 hours, flipping halfway through. You can follow  this recipe  for more detailed instructions.

4. Olives
Olives  are a perfect choice if you’re looking for a salty snack that offers nutritional benefits.
Research shows that olives are packed with phenolic compounds, including secoiridoids, verbascoside, and flavonoids. Phenolic compounds are antioxidants that help protect cells from oxidative damage and inflammation ( 11 ).
In fact, olives contain 100–400 mg of phenolic compounds per 100 grams of olive fruit, which is about the same amount found in 2.2 pounds (1 kg) of  extra virgin olive oil  ( 11 ).
Pair olives with some cheese for a low carb salty snack.

5. Edamame
Edamame beans  are immature soybeans that are typically boiled or steamed in their pod.
Edamame makes a delicious, filling snack and can be sprinkled with salt and other seasonings for an extra kick.
Edamame is a good source of plant-based protein and fiber, as well as vitamins and minerals like folate, magnesium, copper, and  potassium  ( 12 ).
Dip edamame in soy sauce or sprinkle them with sea salt to satisfy your salty cravings in a healthy way.

6. Whipped goat cheese dip and veggies
If you’re longing for a salty, creamy snack, whipped goat cheese dip makes an excellent choice.
Goat cheese  is a filling option because it’s high in protein and healthy fats. Plus, pairing it with fiber-rich vegetables like carrots, broccoli florets, and celery makes it even more satiating.

Avocados  offer a variety of health benefits thanks to their impressive nutrient profile. These creamy fruits are packed with important nutrients like folate, magnesium, potassium, healthy fats, and fiber ( 13 ).
For instance, avocado intake has been associated with better diet quality and nutrient intake, as well as a lower risk of  metabolic syndrome  — a cluster of conditions that increase heart disease and type 2 diabetes risk ( 14 ).
Enjoy sliced avocado on its own sprinkled with sea salt or mash avocado into guacamole and enjoy it with tortilla chips or veggies.

9. Salted nut butter
When you’re looking for something salty to dip fruit or veggies into, you can reach for a jar of salted  nut butter .
A couple of tablespoons of salted almond, peanut, or cashew butter will not only satisfy your salty craving but also may help make you feel more satisfied due to nut butter’s high content of protein and healthy fat ( 15 ).
Try dipping strawberries or apples into creamy salted almond butter or topping celery sticks with chunky salted peanut butter for an irresistible salty snack.

10. Deviled eggs
Eggs  are one of the most nutritious foods you can find, and whipping up deviled eggs makes for a delicious, salty snack.
Even though they’re small in size, eggs deliver a hefty dose of nutrients, including protein, vitamins B2 (riboflavin) and B12, selenium, phosphorus, zinc, and iron ( 16 ).
Numerous studies show that eggs keep you full, and eating them may help reduce your calorie intake later in the day ( 17 ).
