Title: Is Whey Protein Powder Gluten-Free? How to Be Sure

Whey is one of the most common types of protein used in protein powder, and it has many benefits.
It’s easy for your body to use and may help promote muscle growth, reduce exercise-related injury, and improve athletic performance ( 1 ,  2 ).
In addition, given that whey is isolated from milk, it’s naturally gluten-free. However, you may wonder if this applies to all products that contain it, such as whey protein powders.
This article explains how to identify gluten-free whey protein powders.

Gluten in whey protein powders
Most  whey protein  powders contain additional ingredients, such as flavorings, stabilizers, or preservatives.
This means that some powders are made with gluten-containing ingredients.
There’s also a risk of cross-contamination with gluten if a whey protein powder is manufactured in the same facility as other products that contain gluten. This is a risk even if the product itself does not contain a glutenous ingredient.
Some whey protein powders contain gluten or may be contaminated with it.

How to tell if your whey protein powder is gluten-free
In the United States, if the label claims a product is gluten-free, that product must be made with gluten-free ingredients and contain fewer than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten ( 3 ).
These labeling requirements make it simple to identify gluten-free whey protein powders.
Furthermore, you can choose protein powders that have been certified gluten-free by a third-party organization, such as the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO).
To receive the GFCO seal of approval, products must contain no more than 10 ppm of gluten. This is more stringent than the standard required by law.
If you are following a strict  diet for celiac disease , you may want to contact the product manufacturer if you have any concerns or questions.
You should abstain from certain ingredients when following a  gluten-free diet .
Avoid wheat, rye, barley, and all ingredients derived from them, such as wheat flour.
In addition, you should be aware of several tricky ingredients that contain gluten — despite appearing not to.
The following are some of these ingredients:
brewer’s yeast
graham flour
hydrolyzed wheat protein
malt
modified wheat starch
spelt
bulgur
oats , unless they are certified gluten-free
natural and artificial flavors
certain types of food coloring
modified food starch
These ingredients may be cause for concern in products that are not verified gluten-free.
That said, if they are listed on the label of a certified gluten-free product, the product and all its ingredients do not contain gluten.
Look for whey protein powders that are labeled gluten-free or have been certified gluten-free by a third-party organization. You should also avoid all ingredients made with wheat, rye, or barley.
