Title: 11 Healthy, High-Calorie Fruits to Help You Gain Weight

For some people, gaining weight or building muscle can be challenging.
Though fruits aren’t usually the first group of foods that comes to mind when trying to bulk up, several types of fruits can provide the extra calories your body needs to gain weight.
What’s more, they pack important vitamins and minerals to support your health.
Here are 11 healthy and higher-calorie fruits that can help you gain weight.

Fresh fruits
Though most fruits are low in calories, many can help you gain weight due to their higher carb or fat contents.
Here are 4 fresh fruits that can help you gain weight.
Bananas  are an excellent choice if you’re looking to gain weight.
They’re not only nutritious but also a great source of carbs and calories.
One medium-sized (118-gram) banana contains the following nutrients ( 1 ):
Calories:  105
Protein:  1 gram
Fat:  0.4 grams
Carbs:  27 grams
Fiber:  3 grams
Vitamin B6:  26% of the Daily Value (DV)
Manganese:  13% of the DV
In addition, bananas pack many other micronutrients.  Green bananas , in particular, are high in resistant starch, which passes through your digestive tract undigested. Research has linked resistant starch to improved gut health ( 2 ).
Bananas are a convenient on-the-go snack and can be added to oatmeal or smoothies made with other high-calorie ingredients, such as nut butter or full-fat yogurt to help you gain weight.
Avocados  boast an impressive nutrient profile. Plus, they’re high in calories and healthy fats, making them an excellent choice for people looking to gain weight.
Half a medium-sized avocado (100-gram) contains the following nutrients ( 3 ):
Calories:  161
Protein:  2 grams
Fat:  15 grams
Carbs:  8.6 grams
Fiber:  7 grams
Vitamin K:  17.5% of the DV
Folate:  21% of the DV
Avocados are also rich in many other micronutrients, including potassium and vitamins K, C, B5 (pantothenic acid), and B6 (pyridoxine) ( 4 ).
What’s more, they’re incredibly versatile and can be  used in many ways . Try adding them to soups and salads or using them as a spread alongside a protein source like eggs.
Coconut  is a versatile fruit that has gained popularity for its many health benefits. It’s also a great source of calories, as it’s high in fat and moderate in carbs.
A 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of coconut meat provides the following nutrients ( 5 ):
Calories:  99
Protein:  1 grams
Fat:  9.4 grams
Carbs:  4.3 grams
Fiber:  2.5 grams
Manganese:  17% of the DV
Selenium:  5% of the DV
Coconut flesh is also high in many important minerals, including phosphorus and copper.
Best of all, it can be enjoyed in many ways. Try sprinkling shredded coconut onto fruit salad, adding it into stir-fries, or blending it into soups and smoothies to increase the calorie content of your meals and snacks.
Mango is a delicious, sweet fruit that boasts an impressive nutrient profile.
Like bananas,  mangoes  are a good source of calories — mostly from carbs.
One cup (165 grams) of mango provides the following nutrients ( 6 ):
Calories:  99
Protein:  1.4 grams
Fat:  0.6 grams
Carbs:  25 grams
Fiber:  3 grams
Vitamin C:  67% of the DV
Folate:  18% of the DV
In addition, mango is a good source of copper, several B vitamins, and vitamins A and E.
Mango is delicious on its own but also a great addition to smoothies, salsas, and summer salads. Try pairing fresh mango with higher-calorie ingredients like  nuts  or coconut if weight gain is your goal.
Some fresh fruits, such as avocado and coconut, are good sources of healthy fats, which can help you gain weight. Bananas and mangoes are rich in carbs and calories.

Dried fruits
Dried fruits are fruits that have had nearly all of their water content removed through various drying methods.
What’s left is an energy-dense snack that, despite its small size, is very nutritious. Compared to fresh fruit, dried fruit offers a similar amount of micronutrients and can be more convenient and less likely to spoil ( 7 ).
Because dried fruits are energy dense, they’re excellent for people trying to gain weight. However, they’re high in natural sugars, so it’s best to combine them with a source of healthy fat or protein to minimize the potential negative effects on your blood sugar ( 8 ).
Here are some high-calorie, dried fruits that can help you gain weight.
Dates  are the small, cylindrical fruits of the date palm, which grows in tropical areas.
They’re typically sold dried in most Western countries and loaded with nutrients.
One date (24 grams) provides the following nutrients ( 9 ):
Calories:  66.5
Protein:  0.4 grams
Fat:  0.1 grams
Carbs:  18 grams
Fiber:  1.6 grams
Potassium:  4% of the DV
Magnesium:  3% of the DV
These fruits are also a good source of copper, manganese, iron, and vitamin B6.
Given that dates are typically sold dried, they have a long shelf life, making them a versatile way to increase your calorie intake. They make a great binder in baked goods or can be enjoyed by themselves.
Try stuffing dates with almond butter and coconut flakes for a healthy, high-calorie snack.
Prunes are dried plums  that pack a nutritional punch.
A 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of prunes provides the following nutrients ( 10 ):
Calories:  67
Protein:  0.6 grams
Fat:  0.1 grams
Carbs:  18 grams
Fiber:  2 grams
Vitamin K:  14% of the DV
Potassium:  4.4% of the DV
Prunes are also known for their ability to alleviate  constipation . Their fiber content can help add bulk to your stool and speed its transit through your gut ( 11 ).
Prunes have a long shelf life and are easy to add to your diet, making them a simple way to increase your calorie intake and assist healthy weight gain. They taste great on their own, but you can also enjoy them in your favorite salads, smoothies, and baked goods.
Apricots  are a popular yellow stone fruit that can be enjoyed both fresh and dried.
A 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of dried apricots provides the following nutrients ( 12 ):
Calories:  67
Protein:  0.8 grams
Fat:  0.1 grams
Carbs:  18 grams
Fiber:  2 grams
Vitamin A:  6% of the DV
Vitamin E:  8% of the DV
In addition to being an excellent source of calories, dried apricots are a good source of beta-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin — three plant pigments that  support eye health  ( 13 ).
Dried apricots make an excellent pick-me-up snack late in the afternoon and pair well with nuts and cheese, which can also help you gain weight, as they’re good sources of calories and fat.
Enjoyed both fresh and dried, figs are a popular fruit with a sweet-yet-mild flavor.
A 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of dried figs provides the following nutrients ( 14 ):
Calories:  70
Protein:  1 grams
Fat:  0.3 gram
Carbs:  18 grams
Fiber:  3 grams
Potassium:  4% of the DV
Calcium:  3.5% of the DV
Dried figs are tasty on their own or can be enjoyed chopped to garnish oats,  yogurt , or salads. They also pair well with cheese and crackers.
Some people prefer softening their dried figs by boiling them in water for up to 10 minutes.
Raisins are dried  grapes  that come in various sizes and colors.
In the United States and Canada, the name generally refers to all types of dried grapes, whereas in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, it describes only dark-colored, large varieties.
A 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of raisins provides the following nutrients ( 15 ):
Calories:  85
Protein:  1 grams
Fat:  0.1 grams
Carbs:  22 grams
Fiber:  1 grams
Potassium:  4.5% of the DV
Iron:  3% of the DV
Raisins are also a good source of copper, manganese, magnesium, and many B vitamins.
Adding raisins to your diet is an easy way to increase your calorie intake. They taste great straight out of the box and pair well with nuts, yogurts, cheeses, salads, and  oatmeal .
Like raisins,  sultanas  are another type of dried grape.
However, they’re made from green seedless grapes, mainly the Thompson Seedless type. In the United States, sultanas are often called “golden raisins” due to their lighter color.
A 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of sultanas provides the following nutrients ( 16 ):
Calories:  91
Protein:  0.7 grams
Fat:  0 grams
Carbs:  22 grams
Fiber:  0.7 grams
Iron:  4.2% of the DV
Sultanas can be eaten similarly to raisins, making them a convenient way to increase your calorie intake. Eat them alone or combine them with nuts, yogurts, cheeses, or  salads .
Currants are small, sweet, dried grapes of a variety called the “Black Corinth.”
Despite their small size, they pack a powerful, sweet-tangy flavor, making them rather versatile.
A 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of currants provides the following nutrients ( 17 ):
Calories:  79
Protein:  1.14 grams
Fat:  0.1 grams
Carbs:  21 grams
Fiber:  2 grams
Copper:  15% of the DV
Iron:  5% of the DV
Currants are also a good source of zinc, potassium, magnesium, and other micronutrients.
Try adding currants to yogurts, stuffings, and baked dishes to increase their calorie content. They can also be enjoyed with nuts and  seeds  as a tasty mid-morning or afternoon snack.
Dried fruits, such as dates, prunes, apricots, figs, sultanas, currants, and raisins, contain more calories than their fresh counterparts, making them great options for healthy weight gain. In addition, they tend to pack 3–5 times more micronutrients.

The bottom line
There are plenty of higher-calorie, nutrient-dense fruits that can support optimal health and  help you gain weight .
Incorporating a few of the above fruits into your meals or snacks can help increase your daily calorie intake and aid healthy weight gain.
In addition, combining these fruits with a source of  protein  or fat can add extra calories while ensuring your blood sugar levels stay stable.
