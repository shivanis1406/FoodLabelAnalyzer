Title: How Much Does Ozempic Cost Without Insurance?

Ozempic costs around $968 per dose without insurance. You may be able to save by using a discount card or shopping at online pharmacies. Insurers may cover Ozempic if used for type 2 diabetes rather than weight loss.
Ozempic (semaglutide) is a prescription medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adults with type 2 diabetes. It helps lower blood sugar levels, slow digestion, and suppress appetite.
Ozempic is sometimes also prescribed off-label for weight loss in adults with obesity who don’t have type 2 diabetes.
While Ozempic is sometimes covered by insurance, it can be expensive when purchased at the list price without insurance.

The total cost of Ozempic can vary depending on the dosage, the number of pens purchased, and the pharmacy you select.
Shopping around can help you find the best price for Ozempic. The table below shows the cost of 1.5-mg Ozempic pens at various online pharmacies when accessed through  Optum Perks , a platform providing prescription discounts.
One reason Ozempic is so expensive is that there isn’t a generic version available at this time. Generic versions of prescription drugs are usually more affordable.

How to save money on Ozempic
There are a few ways you might be able to save money on Ozempic.
Novo Nordisk offers an assistance program that covers the cost of Ozempic for those who are eligible. To qualify, you need to:
be a citizen or legal resident of the United States
have a total household income that’s no more than 400% of the  federal poverty level
have no insurance, or be enrolled in  Medicare
be ineligible for other government programs like  Medicaid , low-income subsidies, or  Veteran Affairs benefits
You can look for coupons from prescription discount sites like  Optum Perks . Depending on the pharmacy you choose, you may be able to save around $50. Coupons are available for pharmacies like CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens, Walmart, and Costco.
If you have a  flexible spending account (FSA)  or  health savings account (HSA) , you can use these funds to pay for prescription medications, including Ozempic. These accounts allow you to set aside  pretax dollars  for medical expenses, effectively giving you a discount equivalent to your tax rate. Check your plan to confirm.
If you have health insurance, it’s worth checking to see if it covers the cost of Ozempic. Keep in mind that some insurers will cover the cost when Ozempic is used for  type 2 diabetes  but not when it’s used  off-label  for weight loss in adults without type 2 diabetes.
Additionally, Novo Nordisk has a  savings card  that you may be eligible for. In order to use it, your insurance needs to cover part of the cost of the drug. Then, you may be eligible for $150 off the remainder of the cost.
If you’re enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, or a federal or state healthcare program, you won’t be eligible for this savings card.

Is Ozempic covered by insurance?
Many  health insurance plans  cover Ozempic if you need it for diabetes management but don’t cover it for weight loss. The degree of coverage can vary widely based on several factors:
Type of insurance plan:  Not all insurance plans are created equal. Some might cover the total cost, while others only pay a portion, leaving you with copays or  deductibles .
Prior authorization:  Some insurers require a process called prior authorization, meaning that before they agree to cover Ozempic, your doctor must confirm that the medication is essential and that you have considered or tried other less expensive options that haven’t worked for you.
Location:  Given differences in healthcare policies and insurance regulations, the extent of coverage can also vary by state or country.
Plan specifics:  Individual versus family plans, high deductible plans, or plans from different insurers might have distinct stipulations about specialty medications like Ozempic.
Pharmacy benefits:  Some people have separate pharmacy benefit plans, which might have different coverage rules than standard health insurance.
Consulting directly with your insurance company is essential if you’re considering Ozempic as a treatment option. They can give you the most accurate information about coverage and any potential out-of-pocket costs.

Is compounded Ozempic a safe alternative?
With more companies offering compounded versions of GLP-1 medications like Ozempic, it’s essential to understand the associated risks.
Unlike commercially manufactured medications,  compounded semaglutide  is not FDA regulated. This means there’s no guarantee of consistency in quality, potency, or sterility. Injectable medications, in particular, pose a higher risk when not subject to strict regulatory standards, potentially leading to serious health issues.
The efficacy of compounded medications can also vary significantly. Without the rigorous testing and quality control of FDA-approved drugs, the therapeutic benefits of compounded GLP-1s may be inconsistent, potentially compromising treatment outcomes.
Legally, companies can only provide compounded versions of Ozempic under specific conditions, such as during drug shortages or for people with unique medical needs that FDA-approved products cannot meet.
This means that when Ozempic isn’t considered to be in short supply, companies offering compounded semaglutide will likely switch to only offering branded Ozempic, which is typically more expensive.
Given these  safety concerns , Healthline does not recommend taking compounded Ozempic.
