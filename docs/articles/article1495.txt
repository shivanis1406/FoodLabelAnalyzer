Title: What Are Licorice Root's Benefits and Downsides?

Licorice root contains beneficial compounds like glycyrrhizin, which has antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. It may have some health benefits, such as reducing acid reflux.
Licorice root comes from the root of the licorice plant, Glycyrrhiza glabra, which  grows in  Asia, Southern Europe, and the Middle East.
Medicinal use of licorice dates back to ancient Egypt, where the root was made into a sweet drink for pharaohs. Now, it’s used to help treat various ailments and flavor candies, drinks, and medicines.
Licorice root contains nearly  300 compounds , but its primary active compound is glycyrrhizin. This is responsible for the root’s sweet taste, as well as its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties.
That said, glycyrrhizin is also  linked  to some adverse effects. As a result, some products use deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL), which has had the glycyrrhizin removed.
Keep reading to learn more about the potential benefits, side effects, and recommended dosage of licorice root.

Potential benefits
Current research shows promise for several of licorice root’s medicinal uses, but it’s important to note that more research is needed to fully support these potential benefits.
Research  suggests licorice root extract may help treat a variety of skin conditions, such as  acne  and  eczema .
What’s more, a  2019 study  found that a cream containing licorice root, gentian root, and willow bark extract was as effective as a 1%  hydrocortisone  cream in treating eczema symptoms.
Licorice root extract may be used to help relieve symptoms of  gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) , such as  acid reflux ,  heartburn , and  indigestion .
A  2017 study  in 58 adults with GERD found that taking licorice root daily was more effective at reducing symptoms over a 2-year period than commonly used  antacids .

Licorice root extract and its glycyrrhizin may help treat  peptic ulcers . These painful sores develop in your stomach, lower esophagus, or small intestine as a result of H. pylori bacteria.
A  2023 animal study  found that licorice flavonoid could help relieve peptic ulcers by increasing mucus production, reducing inflammation, and improving gut microbiome.
A  2016 study  in 120 adults found that consuming licorice extract in addition to a standard treatment significantly reduced the presence of  H. pylori  after 2 weeks.
Licorice root extract is being studied for its protective effects against certain types of cancer, according to the  National Cancer Institute .
Animal studies have found that licorice root helped slow or prevent cell growth in  skin ,  colorectal , and  breast  cancer.
As research is limited to test tubes and animals, its effects on human cancers are unknown.
However,  research  suggests that licorice root extract may be as effective as the standard treatment for  oral mucositis , a side effect of  chemotherapy .
A  2019 review  found that glycyrrhizin extract from licorice root may help relieve  asthma  due to its anti-inflammatory properties. The authors also suggest it may be the asthma treatment with the fewest potential side effects.
Another  2019 study  found licorice root tea and extract may protect against  strep throat .
However, further research is needed.
Research  suggests that licorice root may help protect against cavities and treat the following oral health conditions:
oral thrush
canker sores
tooth decay
periodontitis
However, more research is needed on the optimal dose and form of licorice root for oral health.
Licorice root extract is tied to several other potential benefits, such as:
aiding  diabetes
reducing  menopause symptoms
boosting  weight loss
treating  hepatitis C
However, more research is needed to fully support these benefits.

Potential side effects and precautions
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has deemed licorice root generally  safe  for use in foods.
However, the FDA does not monitor supplements for purity, effectiveness, or accuracy of ingredient labeling.
As such, it’s important to speak with a healthcare professional before taking licorice root to help treat health conditions.
Both chronic use and large doses of licorice root products may lead to glycyrrhizin accumulation in your body.  Research  suggests that in rare cases, this may cause:
high blood pressure
low potassium levels
arrhythmia
kidney failure
congestive heart failure
pulmonary edema
The  National Center for Complementary and Integrative Care (NCCIC)  notes that chronic use of licorice root may pose a risk for people with hypertension, heart disease, or kidney disease, as well as people who are  pregnant  or nursing.
Licorice root has been shown to  interact with  several medications, including:
blood pressure medications
blood thinners
cholesterol-lowering medications
diuretics
estrogen-based contraceptives
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
If you’re taking any of these medications, it’s best to avoid licorice root products unless a doctor tells you otherwise.

Dosage and forms of licorice root
Licorice root can be purchased fresh or dried. As a supplement, licorice root extract comes in several forms, including:
capsules
powders
tinctures
topical gels
teas
There’s currently no standard dosage recommendation.
A  2021 review  suggests doses vary depending on the form of licorice root and the health condition being treated. For example, two 380-milligram (mg)  DGL  tablets before eating are recommended for GERD.
For asthma, there are three options:
1–5 grams of dried licorice root powder, three times daily
2–5 milliliters of licorice tincture, three times daily
250–300 mg of licorice extract, three times daily
That said, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Scientific Committee of Food (SCF) both recommend limiting glycyrrhizin intake to no more than  100 mg  per day.
Another option is to look for DGL powders or capsules, as these are free of glycyrrhizin, the compound responsible for most of licorice’s side effects. However, it’s unclear whether DGL products have the same health effects.
It’s best to speak with a healthcare professional before trying any licorice products.

Frequently asked questions
Some  research  suggests that licorice root may have benefits for the gut microbiome in mice. However, more research in humans is needed.
One cup of licorice tea is unlikely to cause side effects. However, in  rare cases , drinking high amounts of licorice root tea every day could cause hypertension and low potassium levels, which may require hospitalization.

Takeaway
Licorice root has been used for thousands of years to help treat a variety of ailments, including respiratory conditions and  digestive distress .
Its plant compounds demonstrate potent antioxidant,  anti-inflammatory , and antimicrobial effects.
Though it may relieve acid reflux, eczema, peptic ulcers, and other health issues, more comprehensive human studies are needed.
