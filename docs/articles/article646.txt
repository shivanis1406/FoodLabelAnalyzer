Title: Celiac Disease Diet: Food Lists, Sample Menu, and Tips

Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition that causes severe damage to the lining of the small intestine. Gluten — a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye — triggers its symptoms.
There’s currently no cure for celiac disease. A strict gluten-free diet — also known as the celiac disease diet — must be followed to allow your body to heal.
If you have celiac disease and consume even small amounts of gluten, damage to your intestines will continue, regardless of the absence of symptoms ( 1 ).
For those with celiac disease, avoiding gluten is essential but can be harder than it seems.
This article reviews the benefits of the celiac disease diet and provides lists of foods to eat and avoid, as well as a sample menu and helpful tips.

What Is the Celiac Disease Diet?
Anyone diagnosed with  celiac disease  must follow the celiac disease diet.
It requires avoiding gluten, a naturally occurring protein found in several grains, including wheat, barley, and rye ( 2 ).
When someone with celiac disease eats gluten, it causes an autoimmune response in their body that damages the lining of the small intestine.
As a result, the small intestine cannot properly absorb nutrients from food, creating symptoms like diarrhea, unexplained weight loss, and  malnutrition  ( 3 ).
The only way to prevent this damage is to strictly follow the gluten-free celiac disease diet.
The celiac disease diet avoids gluten-containing foods to prevent autoimmune intestinal damage in people with celiac disease.

Potential Benefits
The celiac disease diet is required for anyone diagnosed with celiac disease and has many benefits.
Many people with celiac disease experience uncomfortable symptoms, such as diarrhea, indigestion, abdominal pain,  fatigue , and headaches ( 4 ).
Following a gluten-free diet for at least one year has been shown to improve these symptoms in more than 90% of people with celiac disease, significantly improving quality of life ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
Intestinal symptoms like diarrhea tend to be the quickest to resolve — with some people experiencing relief after just two days on a gluten-free diet.
Overall, it takes an average of one month to see significant improvements in bowel movements,  bloating , and abdominal pain ( 8 ).
For people with celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an autoimmune response that damages the small intestine, where nutrients are absorbed.
Avoiding gluten prevents this autoimmune process, and the small intestine can heal and return to normal function.
This process takes time — so the earlier a gluten-free diet is started, the better.
In one study, up to 95% of children with celiac disease who followed a  gluten-free diet  for two years no longer showed signs of intestinal damage ( 9 ).
Recovery tends to be slower in adults — with 34–65% achieving gut healing in two years.
However, this number jumps to at least 66% — and up to 90% — after five or more years on a gluten-free diet ( 9 ,  10 ).
Being vigilant about avoiding gluten is crucial. Exposure to even tiny amounts can hinder the healing of your intestines ( 11 ).
Nutrient deficiencies are prevalent in people with celiac disease due to poor absorption in the damaged small intestine.
Deficiencies in iron, calcium, magnesium, zinc, vitamin B12, niacin, riboflavin, and folate, as well as vitamins A, D, E, and K, are the most common ( 12 ,  13 ).
In fact, unexplained  iron deficiency  anemia is one of the most recognized signs of celiac disease in adults ( 14 ).
Yet, supplementing will not always correct deficiencies in people with celiac disease if their intestines are still damaged and unable to absorb nutrients ( 15 ).
Following a gluten-free diet has been shown to repair the intestines enough to correct iron deficiency anemia within six to twelve months, even without taking a supplement ( 16 ).
Women with celiac disease have higher rates of infertility and may be at a greater risk of miscarriage than women without this condition ( 17 ,  18 ).
Research suggests that the autoimmune response that gluten triggers in people with celiac disease may be to blame ( 19 ).
However, following a strict gluten-free diet has been found to  improve fertility  and reduce miscarriage rates ( 19 ,  20 ).
Celiac disease is associated with a three-times greater risk of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma — an aggressive form of  cancer  that occurs in the lymph system ( 21 ).
Several studies have found that diagnosing celiac disease early and following a gluten-free diet can reduce this risk — but more research is needed ( 22 ,  23 ,  24 ).
Up to 75% of people with untreated celiac disease have lower bone density and a higher risk of osteoporosis ( 25 ).
This may be due to poor calcium and vitamin D absorption, as well as increased inflammation that interferes with the bone-building process ( 26 ).
Research shows that diagnosing celiac disease early and starting a gluten-free diet can help stop bone loss and reduce the risk of developing  osteoporosis  ( 26 ,  27 ).
Following a gluten-free diet has many benefits for people with celiac disease, including reducing symptoms, allowing the small intestine to heal and properly absorb nutrients, and decreasing the risk of infertility, cancer, and osteoporosis.

Foods to Eat
There are many naturally  gluten-free foods  to enjoy on the celiac disease diet, including ( 13 ):
Animal proteins:  Beef, chicken, dairy products, eggs, game meat, lamb, pork, seafood, and turkey.

Potential Pitfalls and Helpful Tips
Following a gluten-free diet is relatively simple, but there are a few common pitfalls to avoid.
In the US, products made with refined flour like bread, crackers, and pasta are required to be fortified with the B vitamins niacin, thiamine, riboflavin, and folic acid ( 28 ).
However, gluten-free versions of these foods are not required to be fortified. This may increase your risk of  nutrient deficiencies  if you eat a lot of these products ( 29 ,  30 ).
Additionally, whole-grain wheat, barley, and rye are good sources of fiber, so it’s important to consume other fiber-rich foods, like oats, beans, and legumes when you have to avoid gluten ( 31 ).
Gluten-free products like bread, baked goods, crackers, and  pasta  can cost more than double the price of traditional wheat-based items ( 32 ).
However, these specialty items aren’t required on the celiac disease diet. You can easily meet your nutrient needs by eating less expensive, naturally gluten-free foods.
If you lack inspiration for what to cook on the celiac disease diet, browse the web for gluten-free recipes or look for a gluten-free cookbook  online  or at your local library or bookstore.
While gluten-free items are becoming more widely available in stores and restaurants, the celiac disease diet can sometimes feel limiting and isolating ( 33 ).
This is especially true in social situations that involve food, such as weddings, parties, or dining out with friends ( 34 ,  35 ).
However, following a gluten-free diet gets easier with time and experience. Research shows that most people are accustomed to the diet after five years ( 36 ).
Some tips to make eating out a better experience include reading menus online beforehand, calling restaurants to verify gluten-free options, or bringing at least one gluten-free item to a party.
Staying positive and focusing on the foods you can eat, rather than those you can’t, helps make the celiac disease diet more enjoyable.
Potential pitfalls of the celiac disease diet include nutrient deficiencies, higher costs, and less flexibility when dining out. Eating a balanced diet of naturally gluten-free foods and planning ahead can help you avoid these drawbacks.

The Bottom Line
The celiac disease diet is a gluten-free diet that reduces symptoms of the condition, allows your gut to heal, improves nutrient absorption, and decreases your risk of infertility, cancer, and osteoporosis.
Avoid wheat, barley, rye, and anything made with these grains, and focus on naturally gluten-free foods and grains.
While the celiac disease diet can seem expensive and limiting at first, planning ahead and learning to enjoy new foods can make the transition easier.
