Though you can eat butternut squash raw, this winter squash is commonly roasted or baked.
One cup (205 grams) of cooked butternut squash provides ( 1 ):
Calories:  82
Carbs:  22 grams
Protein:  2 grams
Fiber:  7 grams
Vitamin A:  457% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI)
Vitamin C:  52% of the RDI
Vitamin E:  13% of the RDI
Thiamine (B1):  10% of the RDI
Niacin (B3):  10% of the RDI
Pyridoxine (B6):  13% of the RDI
Folate (B9):  10% of the RDI
Magnesium:  15% of the RDI
Potassium:  17% of the RDI
Manganese:  18% of the RDI
As you can see, butternut squash is  low in calories  but loaded with important nutrients.
Aside from the vitamins and minerals listed above, it’s also a good source of calcium, iron, phosphorus, and copper.
Butternut squash is low in calories but high in many nutrients, including vitamin A, vitamin C, magnesium, and potassium.

Packed With Vitamins and Minerals
Butternut squash is an excellent source of many vitamins and minerals.
A one-cup (205-gram) serving of cooked butternut squash provides more than 450% of the RDI for  vitamin A  and over 50% of the RDI for vitamin C ( 1 ).
It’s also rich in carotenoids — including beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and alpha-carotene — which are plant pigments that give butternut squash its bright color.
These compounds are provitamin A carotenoids, meaning your body converts them into retinal and retinoic acid — the active forms of vitamin A ( 2 ).
Vitamin A is essential for regulating cell growth,  eye health , bone health, and immune function ( 3 ).
Additionally, it’s vital for fetal growth and development, making it an important vitamin for mothers-to-be.
Butternut squash is also rich in vitamin C — a water-soluble nutrient needed for immune function, collagen synthesis, wound healing, and tissue repair ( 4 ).
Both vitamins A and C work as potent antioxidants in your body, protecting your cells from damage caused by unstable molecules called free radicals.
Vitamin E is another antioxidant in butternut squash that helps protect against free radical damage and may reduce your risk of age-related conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease ( 5 ).
This winter squash is also packed with B vitamins — including folate and B6 — which your body needs for energy and red blood cell formation.
What’s more, it’s high in  magnesium , potassium, and manganese — all of which play important roles in bone health ( 6 ).
For example, manganese acts as a co-factor in bone mineralization, the process of building bone tissue ( 7 ).
Butternut squash is an excellent source of provitamin A carotenoids, vitamin C, B vitamins, potassium, magnesium, and manganese.

High Antioxidant Content May Decrease Disease Risk
Butternut squash is an abundant source of powerful antioxidants, including vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene.
Antioxidants help prevent or slow cellular damage and reduce inflammation, which may reduce your risk of several chronic diseases.
Research has shown that diets high in certain antioxidants found in butternut squash — such as carotenoid antioxidants and vitamin C — can reduce your risk of certain cancers.
For example, studies have demonstrated that a higher dietary intake of beta-carotene and vitamin C may reduce lung cancer risk.
A review of 18 studies found that people with the highest beta-carotene intake had a 24% lower risk of lung cancer compared to those with the lowest intake ( 8 ).
Another review of 21 studies found that lung cancer risk decreased by 7% for every additional 100 mg of vitamin C per day ( 9 ).
What’s more, a review of 13 studies indicated that higher blood levels of beta-carotene were related to a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality, including death from  cancer  ( 10 ).
Eating produce has long been associated with a lower risk of heart disease ( 11 ).
However, yellow and orange vegetables and fruits — including butternut squash — have been shown to be particularly effective at protecting against heart disease.
The antioxidants found in these brightly colored vegetables have a powerful impact on  heart health .
A study in 2,445 people demonstrated that heart disease risk fell 23% for every additional daily serving of yellow-orange vegetables ( 12 ).
It’s thought that the carotenoids found in these vegetables protect heart health by lowering blood pressure, reducing inflammation, and controlling the expression of specific genes related to heart disease ( 13 ).
Certain dietary practices, such as eating more antioxidant-rich foods, may protect against mental decline.
A 13-year study in 2,983 people associated a carotenoid-rich dietary pattern with enhanced  memory recall , visual attention, and verbal fluency during aging ( 14 ).
What’s more, higher dietary intake of vitamin E may have a protective effect against Alzheimer’s disease.
An 8-year study in 140 older adults found that those with the highest blood levels of vitamin E had a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease compared to those with the lowest levels of this vitamin ( 15 ).
The high antioxidant content of butternut squash may reduce your risk of certain conditions, including heart disease, lung cancer, and mental decline.

May Aid Weight Loss
One cup (205 grams) of cooked butternut squash has only 83 calories and provides 7 grams of filling fiber — making it an excellent choice if you want to lose excess weight and body fat.
It contains both insoluble and soluble fiber. In particular, soluble fiber has been associated with  fat loss  and been shown to reduce appetite, which is important when you’re trying to control your calorie intake ( 16 ).
Many studies have found that a higher dietary fiber intake promotes weight loss and reduces body fat.
A study in 4,667 children and teens showed that obesity risk decreased by 21% in those with the highest fiber intake compared to those who consumed the least fiber ( 17 ).
Additionally, a study in 252 women demonstrated that for every one gram increase in total dietary fiber, weight decreased by 0.55 pounds (0.25 kg) and fat decreased by 0.25 of a percentage point ( 18 ).
Plus, high-fiber diets may help keep weight off over time. An 18-month study in women found that those with the highest intake of fiber lost more weight than those with the lowest intake — showing that fiber is important for  long-term weight loss  ( 19 ).
Adding butternut squash to your meals is an excellent way of decreasing hunger and boosting your fiber intake.
Butternut squash is low in calories and packed with fiber — making it a great choice for any healthy weight loss plan.
