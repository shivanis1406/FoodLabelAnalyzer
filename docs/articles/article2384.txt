Title: A 2,000-Calorie Diet: Food Lists and Meal Plan

A 2,000-calorie diet meets the needs of most adults. But your needs may vary depending on age, gender, weight, height, activity level, and weight goals.
2,000-calorie diets are considered standard for most adults, as this number is considered adequate to meet most people’s energy and nutrient needs.
This article tells you everything you need to know about 2,000-calorie diets, including foods to include and avoid, as well as a sample meal plan.

Why 2,000 calories are often considered standard
Though nutritional requirements vary by individual, 2,000 calories are often considered standard.
This number is based on the estimated nutritional needs of most adults and used for  meal-planning purposes  according to the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines ( 1 ).
Additionally, it’s used as a benchmark to create recommendations on nutrition labels ( 2 ).
In fact, all nutrition  labels  contain the phrase: “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000-calorie diet. Your Daily Values may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs” ( 3 ).
Due to these daily values, consumers can compare, for example, amounts of sodium and saturated fat in a given food to the maximum daily recommended levels.
Calories supply your body with the energy it needs to sustain life ( 4 ).
Because everyone’s body and lifestyle is different, people have different  calorie needs .
Depending on activity level, it’s estimated that adult women require 1,600–2,400 calories per day, compared with 2,000–3,000 calories for adult men ( 1 ).
However, calorie needs vary drastically, with some people requiring more or fewer than 2,000 calories per day.
Additionally, individuals who are in periods of growth, such as pregnant women and teenagers, often need more than the standard 2,000 calories per day.
When the number of calories you burn is greater than the number you consume, a  calorie deficit  occurs, potentially resulting in weight loss.
Conversely, you may  gain weight  when you consume more calories than you burn. Weight maintenance occurs when both numbers are equal.
Therefore, depending on your weight goals and activity level, the appropriate number of calories you should consume differs.
The average adult needs approximately 2,000 calories per day. Yet, individual calorie recommendations depend on many factors, such as your size, gender, exercise level, weight goals, and overall health.

Can a 2,000-calorie diet aid weight loss?
Following a 2,000-calorie diet may help some people  lose weight . Its effectiveness for this purpose depends on your age, gender, height, weight, activity level, and weight loss goals.
It’s important to note that weight loss is much more complicated than simply reducing your calorie intake. Other factors that affect weight loss include your environment, socioeconomic factors, and even your  gut bacteria  ( 5 ,  6 ).
That said, calorie restriction is one of the main targets in obesity prevention and management ( 7 ,  8 ).
For example, if you reduce your daily calorie intake from 2,500 to 2,000, you should lose 1 pound (0.45 kg) in 1 week, as 3,500 calories (500 calories saved over 7 days) is the approximate number of calories in 1 pound of body fat ( 9 ,  10 ).
On the other hand, a 2,000-calorie diet would exceed the calorie needs of some people, likely resulting in weight gain.
Though 2,000-calorie diets have the potential to aid weight loss, it’s important to tailor your intake to your individual needs, as calorie needs vary based on many factors.

Foods to eat
A well-balanced, healthy diet includes plenty of whole, unprocessed foods.
Where your calories come from is just as important as how many calories you consume.
While it’s vital to ensure that you’re getting enough carbs, protein, and fat, a focus on foods rather than  macronutrients  may be more helpful to create a healthy diet ( 11 ).
At each meal, you should focus on high-quality protein and fiber-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
While you can indulge on occasion, your diet should mainly consist of the following types of foods:
Whole grains:  brown rice, oats, bulgur, quinoa, farro, millet, etc.
Fruits:  berries, peaches, apples, pears, melons, bananas, grapes, etc.
Non-starchy vegetables:  kale, spinach, peppers, zucchini, broccoli, bok choy, Swiss chard, tomatoes, cauliflower, etc.
Starchy vegetables:  butternut squash, sweet potatoes, winter squash, potatoes, peas, plantains, etc.
Dairy products:  reduced or full-fat plain yogurt, kefir, and full-fat cheeses.
Lean meats:  turkey, chicken, beef, lamb, bison, veal, etc.
Nuts, nut butters, and seeds:  almonds, cashews, macadamia nuts, hazelnuts, sunflower seeds, pine nuts, and natural nut butters
Fish and seafood:  tuna, salmon, halibut, scallops, mussels, clams, shrimp, etc.
Legumes:  chickpeas, black beans, cannellini beans, kidney beans, lentils, etc.
Eggs:  organic, whole eggs are the healthiest and most nutrient dense
Plant-based protein:  tofu, edamame, tempeh, seitan, plant-based protein powders, etc.
Healthy fats:  avocados,  coconut oil , avocado oil, olive oil, etc.
Spices:  ginger, turmeric, black pepper, red pepper, paprika, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.
Herbs:  parsley, basil, dill, cilantro, oregano, rosemary, tarragon, etc.
Calorie-free beverages:  black coffee, tea, sparkling water, etc.
Studies suggest that adding a  protein source  to meals and snacks can help promote feelings of fullness and aid weight loss and maintenance ( 12 ,  13 ,  14 ).
Additionally, monitoring your carb intake and choosing the right types of carbs can assist with weight maintenance.
It’s important to eat a variety of whole, unprocessed foods — not only to meet your nutritional needs but also to achieve and maintain a healthy weight and promote optimal health.
A balanced, healthy diet should consist of a variety of whole, unprocessed foods, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, legumes, whole grains, and healthy fats.

Foods to avoid
It’s best to avoid foods that provide little to no nutritional value — also known as “empty calories.” These are typically foods that are high in calories and  added sugars  yet low in nutrients ( 15 ).
Here is a list of foods to avoid or limit on any healthy diet, regardless of your calorie needs:
Added sugars:  agave, baked goods, ice cream, candy, etc. — limit added sugars to less than 5–10% of your total calories ( 11 )
Fast food:  French fries, hot dogs, pizza, chicken nuggets, etc.
Processed and refined carbs:  bagels, white bread, crackers, cookies, chips, sugary cereals, boxed pasta, etc.
Fried foods:  French fries, fried chicken, doughnuts, potato chips, fish and chips, etc.
Sodas and sugar-sweetened beverages:  sports drinks, sugary juices, sodas, fruit punch, sweetened tea and coffee drinks, etc.
Diet and low-fat foods:  diet ice cream, diet boxed snacks, diet packaged and frozen meals, and  artificial sweeteners , such as Sweet n’ Low, etc.
Though most of your diet should consist of whole, unprocessed foods, it’s okay to indulge in less healthy foods occasionally.
However, regularly eating the foods on this list may not only be harmful to your health but also delay or hinder weight loss or even disrupt your weight maintenance efforts.
It’s best to avoid or limit foods with little to no nutritional value, such as fried foods, refined carbs, and sugary snacks and beverages.
