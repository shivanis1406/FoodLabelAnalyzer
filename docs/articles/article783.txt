Title: Does Exercise Help You Lose Weight? The Surprising Truth

Resistance training can help with weight loss by maintaining muscle mass and boosting metabolism. Cardio can also help, but it may make you hungrier. Read on to learn which type of exercise is best for you.

Cardio exercise and weight
One of the most popular types of exercise for weight loss is  aerobic exercise , also known as cardio. Examples include:
walking
running
cycling
swimming
Aerobic exercise doesn’t have a major effect on your muscle mass, at least not compared with lifting weights. However, it is very effective at burning calories.
The authors of a  2021 research review  concluded that exercise led to significant weight loss and  visceral fat  loss in adults with overweight or obesity.
That means adding cardio to your lifestyle is likely to help you manage your weight and improve your metabolic health, as long as you keep your calorie intake the same.
Doing aerobic exercise regularly can increase the number of calories you burn and help you lose body fat.

Resistance training and weight
All physical activity can help you burn calories. But resistance training, such as weightlifting, helps increase the strength and amount of muscle you have.
A  2022 study  in adults with obesity examined the effects of cardio, resistance training, or both on body composition and found that those who did both types of exercise preserved more muscle mass than those who did only cardio.
Having more muscle also  increases your metabolism , helping you burn more calories around the clock — even when at rest. Thus, doing some form of resistance training is a crucial addition to an effective long-term weight loss plan.
Lifting weights helps maintain and build muscle, which helps you burn more calories.

High intensity interval training and weight
High intensity interval training (HIIT)  is a type of exercise that involves alternating short bursts of intense exercise and rest periods.
You can do HIIT with cardio or resistance training exercises. Most HIIT workouts are only 10 to 20 minutes long, but this type of exercise can offer some powerful benefits for weight loss.
One  2023 review  found that HIIT reduced visceral fat more than moderate-intensity continuous exercise. HIIT also takes less time to perform.
Because of the intensity of HIIT, you should consult a healthcare professional before starting a new HIIT routine, especially if you have known heart concerns.
HIIT may offer similar benefits to moderate-intensity continuous exercise but with a smaller time commitment.

Exercise and appetite
You’ve probably heard that physical exertion is a good way to work up an appetite, or maybe you’ve even found yourself eating more than usual after a vigorous workout.
But most research suggests that exercise has an appetite-suppressing effect.
In one  small study  involving 20 active, healthy adults, researchers noted that the participants ate more food in the meal before a workout than after a workout. They also found that participants ate less food on the days they exercised than on the days they didn’t.
In another  small study  involving 26 women with obesity who were on low calorie diets, researchers found that short HIIT sessions had a strong appetite-suppressing effect.
Regardless, more research is needed, and hunger responses to exercise are likely highly individual. If you’re trying to lose weight but tend to eat more than usual after long or vigorous exercise sessions, consider shorter workouts (such as HIIT) or less intense exercise.
Exercise may make you feel either more or less hungry. However, research mostly suggests that exercise has an appetite-reducing effect.

Other benefits of exercise
According to a  2020 review , regular exercise may help reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.
Researchers  have also found that exercise can help maintain or increase muscle mass. It also keeps bones strong and dense and helps fight the onset of osteoporosis.
Additionally, exercise offers some mental health benefits, such as  decreasing  symptoms of anxiety. It also  appears to offer  some protection against neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease.
Keep these benefits in mind when you consider the effects of exercise. Even if it doesn’t make a huge difference in weight loss, it has other benefits that are just as (if not more) important.
Exercise is about more than just weight loss. It can reduce your risk of chronic diseases, help you reduce and manage stress, and protect against some neurodegenerative conditions.

Recommendations
Because of its numerous health benefits, exercise should be a part of your routine regardless of your weight goals.
According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , adults should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week, as well as 2 days of muscle-strengthening activity per week.
Additionally, don’t depend only on the scale to track your progress. If you’re gaining muscle while losing fat, your weight may not change as quickly as you’d like it to, but you’ll still be making progress toward your goal.
Consider taking your measurements as well, and keep track of how your clothes fit. These are much better indicators of  fat loss  than weight alone.
Whether you’re trying to lose weight or not, aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise and 2 resistance training sessions per week for optimal health.

Takeaway
Exercise is important for overall health, and different types of exercise may offer different advantages for weight loss.
If you’re trying to lose weight, you may be interested in resistance training, which can preserve muscle and increase calories burned at rest, and HIIT, which is less time consuming than many other forms of exercise.
