Title: The Top Health Benefits of Watermelon

Watermelon is centuries old fruit that is juicy and sweet, and many view it as a perfect treat to quench your thirst during summer heat.
With a bright red flesh and little seeds embedded throughout,  watermelon is packed  with a plethora of nutrients and antioxidants that include vitamins A and C.
Here are some of the top health benefits of watermelon.

Helps you stay hydrated
Staying hydrated is important for your body to function properly.
Body temperature regulation, normal organ function, nutrient delivery to cells, and alertness are only some of the bodily processes that  rely on  adequate hydration.
Eating foods with a  high water content  may help give your body the water it needs to function properly. Since watermelon is  mostly water , it can serve as a good choice for daily water intake.
That water content also means this melon has a low  calorie density  — in other words, very few calories for its total weight. Eating foods with low calorie densities like watermelon  may help  with weight management by keeping you feeling full for longer.

Packed with nutrients and beneficial plant compounds
Watermelon  contains  a variety of nutrients, including potassium, magnesium, and vitamins A and C. It’s also relatively low in calories.
Here are the nutrients in 1 cup (152 grams) of raw, diced watermelon:
Calories:  46
Carbs:  11.5 grams
Fiber:  0.6 grams
Sugar:  9.4 grams
Protein:  0.9 grams
Fat:  0.2 grams
Vitamin A:  5% of the Daily Value (DV)
Vitamin C:  14% of the DV
Potassium:  4% of the DV
Magnesium:  4% of the DV
Watermelon is also a rich source of  citrulline , an amino acid that  may improve  exercise performance.
Plus, it boasts  antioxidants , including vitamin C, carotenoids, lycopene, and cucurbitacin E, all of which are  beneficial  for your health in watermelon as well as other food sources.
These compounds  help combat  free radicals, which are unstable molecules that may damage your cells if they accumulate in your body. Over time, this damage may lead to conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.

May have anti-cancer effects
Several plant compounds found in watermelon, including lycopene and cucurbitacin E, may have possible anticancer effects.
While study results are mixed,  lycopene intake  may be associated with a lower risk of some types of cancer, such as  prostate  and  colorectal  cancers.
Lycopene is believed to work by  lowering  blood levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), a hormone that promotes cell division. Notably, cancer forms when cell division becomes uncontrollable.
Additionally, cucurbitacin E  may inhibit  tumor growth by promoting your body’s process of destroying and removing  cancer cells .
All the same, further human research is necessary.

May improve heart health
Several nutrients in watermelon  may support  heart health.
Heart disease is a  leading cause  of death worldwide. Lifestyle factors, including the foods you eat, may  lower your risk  of heart attack and stroke by reducing your blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
Research suggests that lycopene  may help  lower cholesterol and blood pressure, both key in cardiovascular health.
Watermelon also contains citrulline, an amino acid that  may increase  nitric oxide levels in your body and help your blood vessels expand to lower blood pressure.
Other vitamins and minerals in watermelon include  magnesium , potassium, and vitamins A, B6, and C — all of which are healthy and can help your heart and overall health.

May reduce inflammation and oxidative stress
Inflammation is a key driver of many chronic diseases.
The combination of antioxidants, lycopene, and vitamin C in watermelon  may help lower  inflammation and oxidative damage.
This  animal study  noted that watermelon powder given to rats to supplement an unhealthy diet developed less oxidative stress and lower levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein than those in the control group.
Additionally, an  8-week study  gave 31 people with obesity and high inflammatory markers 500 mg of  vitamin C  twice daily. They showed a significant decrease in inflammatory markers compared with the control group.
As an antioxidant, lycopene may also  delay  the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease. But more research is needed on that topic.

Benefits for bones and joints
Somewhat connected to the effects on inflammation in your body, watermelon  may also benefit  your bones and joint health.
The fruit contains a natural pigment called beta-cryptoxanthin, which may protect your joints from inflammation. Though it’s limited, research even indicates that over time, less inflammation  could help protect  you from developing conditions such as osteoporosis or rheumatoid arthritis.
More research is needed.

May help prevent macular degeneration
The watermelon compound lycopene may have  benefits for your eyes .
Age-related macular degeneration  (AMD) is a common eye problem that can cause blindness in older adults.
Lycopene’s role as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound  may help prevent and inhibit  AMD, though research is limited.  This study  that treated eye cells with lycopene found that it decreased the capacity of inflammatory markers to damage cells.
Keep in mind that more research is necessary.

May relieve muscle soreness
Citrulline, an amino acid found in watermelon,  may have benefits  that include improving exercise performance and reducing muscle soreness.
It’s also available as a  supplement .
One  review  found that regular intake of citrulline for at least 7 days improved aerobic performance by increasing the body’s production of  nitric oxide , which helps expand blood vessels so that your heart doesn’t need to work as hard to pump blood through your body.
What’s more, some evidence suggests that watermelon itself — not just citrulline — may  aid your body after exercise .
Still, more research is needed.

May aid skin health
Vitamins A and C, which are found in watermelon, are important for  skin health .
Vitamin C — either when eaten or applied topically —  helps your body  make collagen, a protein that keeps your skin supple and your hair strong.
A higher intake of vitamin C from food or supplements  may decrease  your chances of developing wrinkles and dry skin.
Vitamin A is also important for healthy skin since it  helps  create and repair skin cells.
Bear in mind that further studies on watermelon specifically are needed.

Helping digestion
Watermelon contains plenty of water and a small amount of  fiber , both of which are necessary for healthy digestion.
Fiber  helps  keep your bowels regular, while water  more efficiently  moves waste through your digestive tract.

Frequently asked questions
Watermelon does contain natural sugar, though it has less than other fruits. A medium-sized wedge (286g or roughly one-six of a watermelon) has about  17.7g of total sugars  in it. This is a healthy fruit or people with diabetes and those monitoring their blood sugar levels, though portion size and how much watermelon you eat are all important to keep in mind. The  American Diabetes Association  recommends eating fresh, frozen, or canned fruit without added sugars.
Yes, watermelon is considered a superfood. The term “superfood” was created for marketing purposes to help sell certain healthy foods, and it’s generally used for foods that have a lot of nutritional benefit while only having minimal calories. There is no hard or fast rule as to what foods meet that criteria, but they’re generally packed full of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. That  certainly applies  to watermelon.
Since watermelon is mostly water and can help hydrate your body, you can eat this fruit before bed.

Takeaway
Watermelon is a tasty, thirst-quenching  fruit  that many people enjoy in the heat of summer.
It has a very high water content and provides nutrients like lycopene, citrulline, and vitamins A and C.
Studies suggest that this sweet, red melon may even boost heart health, reduce muscle soreness, and decrease inflammation, though more research is needed.
