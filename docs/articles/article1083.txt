Title: Fibromyalgia Diet: 10 Tasty Recipes

Fibromyalgia is a chronic disease that affects around 4 million adults in the United States ( 1 ).
Though research is limited, scientific evidence shows that some diets reduce pain and symptoms related to fibromyalgia.
This article reviews which foods to eat and avoid to help manage fibromyalgia, along with 10 tasty recipes.

Fibromyalgia and diet
Fibromyalgia  is a chronic condition that’s characterized by widespread muscle pain. Due to chronic pain, many people with fibromyalgia also have sleep disorders, chronic fatigue, and depression ( 1 ).
The cause of fibromyalgia isn’t yet known, and the condition cannot be cured. People with fibromyalgia must manage their symptoms through medical treatment and lifestyle changes ( 1 ).
One way to help symptoms is by following a certain diet.
Though little research has been done, some evidence points to certain dietary approaches that may help manage fibromyalgia symptoms. These include ( 2 ):
Low calorie diets.  Weight loss may help with fibromyalgia symptoms, so a low calorie diet may be a good approach.
Vegetarian diets.  These diets are rich in anti-inflammatory fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes. The strongest evidence is for raw vegetarian diets.
Low FODMAP diets . FODMAPS are types of carbs that some people can’t digest.  Low FODMAP diets  exclude most dairy products, grains, fruits, and vegetables. It’s a very restrictive, highly anti-inflammatory way of eating.
A diet high in anti-inflammatory foods may also help manage fibromyalgia symptoms, as chronic inflammation is one of the suspected causes of the disease ( 3 ).
Regardless, this disease and its symptoms are highly individualized. Different diets may work better or worse depending on the individual.
You may benefit from working with a registered dietitian if you’re following a more complex eating pattern, such as a raw vegetarian or low FODMAP diet, to manage your fibromyalgia symptoms.
Types of foods that are typically part of dietary approaches for fibromyalgia include ( 2 ):
Low calorie:  low calorie,  high protein , high fiber, or filling foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains
Vegetarian:  fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and seeds; some vegetarians may include eggs or dairy products while raw vegetarians eat only uncooked plant foods
Low FODMAP:  only foods that are low in FODMAPs, including most meats, rice, some fruits and vegetables, and limited dairy products
You should also add a variety of anti-inflammatory foods that fit into your preferred eating pattern, as they may help alleviate symptoms. Examples of anti-inflammatory foods include ( 4 ,  5 ):
Protein:  salmon, eggs, chickpeas, Greek yogurt
Fruits:  bananas, oranges, apples, grapes, blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, tomatoes, avocado
Vegetables:  spinach, kale, zucchini, cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, bell peppers, cucumber, carrots
Carbs:  sweet potatoes, brown rice, honey
Fats:  olive oil, coconut oil
Herbs and spices:  turmeric , ginger, cinnamon, rosemary, garlic, cloves
Note that some of these foods, such as honey and chickpeas, are higher in FODMAPs. As such, avoid them if you’re strictly following a low FODMAP diet.
On the other hand, foods that are typically avoided in the dietary approaches to fibromyalgia are ( 2 ):
Low calorie.  Exclude empty calories like chips, cookies, cakes, ice cream, sugary drinks, added sugars, and added fats.
Vegetarian.  All vegetarians exclude meat from their diet. However, raw vegetarians will also exclude cooked foods.
Low FODMAP.  On the low FODMAP diet, you need to exclude all foods that are  high in FODMAPs . This includes wheat, dairy products, beans, garlic, and onions.
Anti-inflammatory.  To decrease inflammation you should also avoid pro-inflammatory foods, which include highly processed foods, refined carbs, fast food, and processed vegetable oils like soybean oil or corn oil ( 6 ).
Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by muscle pain. Some dietary approaches may help manage its symptoms, including anti-inflammatory, low calorie, raw vegetarian, or low FODMAP diets.
