Sport modes   50+, including hiking, climbing, cycling, and strength training
Price   $699.99
*Price may vary.
The  Garmin Fenix 7  is our top choice.
It provides detailed data on your run metrics, including:
distance
time
pace
cadence

It also tracks your daily activity and estimates your VO 2  max — the maximum amount of oxygen your body can use during exercise.
What’s more, the watch provides suggested  running  workouts based on your training performance for the week.
Another helpful feature for runners is the built-in GPS, which tracks your speed, distance, and elevation in real time.

The watch’s maps are clear and easy to read. It also has a “back to start” feature that guides you back to your starting point, which is super helpful if you’re running somewhere new.
The Fenix 7 offers a massively improved battery life of up to 18 days with regular use and 136 hours using GPS. The Solar and Sapphire Solar models add solar charging for even longer battery life.
It has a water rating of 10 ATM, which means it can withstand pressure equivalents of up to 328 feet (ft), or 100 meters (m). While you can take it swimming or snorkeling, the company doesn’t recommend wearing it for scuba diving.
Additional features include:
heart rate and sleep tracking
weight and calorie intake tracking
stress management tools
music apps
more than 20 supported exercise activities
hands-free communication via Bluetooth to answer incoming calls from a paired phone

Solo runners will appreciate the incident detection, which detects falls and sends an automated text to your designated emergency contact to let them know where you are.
The Garmin Fenix 7 series is a solid choice for smaller wrists. The Fenix 7 models vary in band size, wrist circumference, case diameter, and screen size, so anyone should be able to find a size that suits their wrist.
Those with menstrual cycles will appreciate the option to use Garmin Connect to track periods. Y0u can log physical and emotional symptoms each day, which can help you see patterns of hormonal fluctuations each month that may be affecting your sleep or stress levels.
One thing that sets Garmin apart is that the cycle tracking can also be used by those transitioning into menopause.

While this product from Amazfit may be one of the most affordable options on the market, it boasts an impressive selection of fitness-related features.
Compared with the Band 5 (Band 6 was skipped), the Amazfit Band 7 has a bigger and brighter screen, a bigger battery, 100 new sport modes, and an always-on display (AOD) for only a slightly higher price and weight.
The device keeps tabs on your:
heart rate
sleep quality
blood oxygen saturation levels

It’s also equipped with a crisp AMOLED (active-matrix organic light-emitting diode) display and long battery life of up to 18 days.
It even has 120 sport modes, four smart sport modes, and stress management tools such as breathing exercises. Its ExerSense software recognizes when you’re walking, running, rowing, or using an elliptical machine.
Additionally, with the use of the Cycle Tracking widget, the device offers menstrual tracking and will alert you when you’re ovulating or about to start your period.
The Amazfit Band 7 has Alexa built in and can connect with your smartphone to:
alert you of new calls and texts
control your music
send you reminders to keep moving throughout the day

The Band 7 has a water rating of 5 ATM, which means it can withstand pressures equivalent to a depth of 50 m (164 ft).
It also calculates your Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) score, which takes into account all activity that affects your heart rate (even playing with your pet!) and gives you an average score for the day. PAI wasn’t created by Amazfit — it’s an algorithm developed and used in  cardiac research and rehabilitation .
Available colors:  black or beige bands by default; orange, blue, pink, and green straps available as $10 add-on from Amazfit website

Packed with features and available in a range of colors and sizes, the Apple Watch Series 8 is a high tech fitness tracker worth the splurge. It has added health and safety options since Series 7 that make it an even more impressive wellness device.
Series 8 watches have the Apple Watch’s first temperature sensors — two of them — that record your body’s temperature throughout the day and night and track them in the Apple Health app.
Car crash detection is also new, alerting emergency responders and your emergency contacts if you’re unresponsive after 10 seconds.
Series 8 also has updated to the always-on display, which is slightly larger thanks to thinner bezels.
The watch tracks your daily activity and offers a variety of exercise modes, including:
cycling
dance
yoga
You can also create group exercise challenges to do with your friends and family.
It has a waterproof rating of up to 164 ft (50 m), so it can also be used in the pool.
Additional metrics tracked include:
heart rhythm
blood oxygen levels
sleep cycles
The newest version has the ability to take an  electrocardiogram (ECG)  with the built-in ECG app to measure heart health and can give you insights into how your body is responding to stress.
But it  doesn’t detect heart attacks . If users experience any symptoms, such as chest pain, pressure, or tightness, the company urges users to call emergency services immediately.
People who have periods will appreciate the updated suite of menstrual tracking features. The new temperature sensors allow the watch to deliver ovulation estimates and more detailed period predictions. The watch can also track your menstrual cycle, fertile windows, and symptoms, such as cramps and fatigue.
Two communication models are available: GPS and GPS + Cellular. Both let you take advantage of GPS features. But with the cellular version, as long as you’re in cellular range, you can leave your iPhone at home and still:
make and receive calls
send and receive messages
stream music
access the Internet

With the GPS model, you can do these things only if your iPhone is nearby or your watch is connected to a Wi-Fi network.
You can enable Apple Pay on your watch, which allows you to use your stored card wherever contactless payments are accepted.
While the watch’s battery life in regular mode is only 18 hours, the charging speed of the Series 8 matches that of the Series 7. According to Apple’s website, the battery can reach an 80% charge in about 45 minutes and a 100% charge in 75 minutes using a fast-charging cable.

Walking the tightrope between fitness tracker and sports watch can be challenging, and the Fitbit Sense 2 gets the balance just right.
For the fitness enthusiast, it offers a whole suite of health and workout features to monitor stress, heart rate, fitness, and sleep, plus sensors including heart rate, ECG, electrodermal activity (EDA), blood oxygen, and temperature.
For the smartphone fan, it adds Google Maps, Google Wallet, built-in Alexa, built-in GPS, and on-wrist Bluetooth calls, texts, and phone notifications. Everything works seamlessly in the refreshed FitbitOS, thanks to parent Google.
The EDA scan app is a stress management tool that tracks your heart rate and tiny electric changes on your skin to show how your body responds during mindfulness sessions and how well you handle stress.
By adding the menstrual health tile in the Today tab of the Fitbit app, you can track your menstrual cycle, log your periods, and record any monthly symptoms. You can also set notifications to be reminded of when your period is supposed to start.
The Fitbit ECG app on the Fitbit wrist device combines with the Heart Rhythm Assessment in the Fitbit app on a phone or tablet to create and record an ECG on the wrist device. You can view results on your wrist device, phone, or tablet and export a PDF from the Fitbit app to your doctor.

The Garmin Swim 2 offers plenty of features to help maximize your performance next time you hit the pool.
In addition to your heart rate, it tracks your:
pace
stroke count
swimming  efficiency
distance
There’s even an option to put it in “open water” mode, which uses GPS and tracks your performance while you’re swimming in an ocean or river.
Like the Fenix 7, the Garmin Swim 2 can track your menstrual cycle via Garmin Connect, if you wish.
It also provides pacing alerts to help you stay on track and includes modes designed for both pool and open-water swimming.
Plus, the Garmin Swim 2 features:
smartphone notifications
fitness tracking
stress tracking
built-in sport apps for other activities, such as jogging and cycling
The Garmin Swim 2 doesn’t support Garmin Pay, which may be a downside for some. It also lacks a built-in music player, though you can control music with it when you’re near your phone.
The Swim 2 is water-resistant up to 164 ft (50 m) and offers a battery life of up to 7 days with regular use or 13 hours with continuous GPS.

If you don’t like the bulkiness of most smartwatches, you’ll love the minimalist design of the WHOOP 4.0.
Unlike other devices on this list, the WHOOP doesn’t receive smartphone or other app notifications.
Instead, it’s entirely focused on collecting your data, including:
activity
sleep
blood oxygen levels
heart rate
body temperature

It’s especially beneficial for weightlifting and  cross-training  activities such as CrossFit, which incorporate a wide variety of movements. It measures your daily recovery level, which estimates how well your body is adapting to stress.
The strap tracks the strain on your body as you work out and the intensity of the workout itself. It suggests a target daily exertion level to prevent overtraining and injury.
The strap is included with your monthly WHOOP membership, which comes with:
personalized sleep and training recommendations
daily performance reports
access to the online WHOOP community

The paid monthly membership costs $30 per month.
Just keep in mind that you can’t play music directly from the band, so you’ll need to keep your phone with you if you want to listen.
Both the WHOOP 4.0 and the battery pack are water-resistant up to 32.8 ft (10 m) for 2 hours.
Menstrual Cycle Coaching is a newer feature of the WHOOP that’s intended to help members who menstruate optimize their sleep and training for different phases of their cycle.
This feature is not intended for those who use hormonal birth control, which eliminates natural monthly hormonal fluctuations (though the original WHOOP sleep and strain recommendations are accurate for those using hormonal birth control).
Available colors:  onyx band free with membership; other colors available to purchase on WHOOP website

The  Oura Ring Gen 3  is an innovative fitness tracker designed for comfort and convenience.
Unlike others on this list, the Oura Ring is worn on your finger and easily doubles as a piece of jewelry.
Thanks to tiny sensors, the device collects detailed information about your activity and  sleep habits  to help you manage your health.
It measures metrics such as:
resting heart rate
heart rate variability
body temperature
step count
calories burned

It’s also one of the best sleep trackers, as it’s comfortable to wear at night and collects data on your sleep quality, including the  stages  and duration of your sleep. The Oura app offers an individualized sleep report every morning.
However, because the device doesn’t include a screen, you can’t control music or receive smartphone notifications with the Oura Ring.
The Oura is water-resistant up to 328 ft (100 m) and boasts a battery life of up to 7 days, making it a very practical product.
In addition to a period prediction feature, which uses biosignals such as temperature and data from past cycles to predict your period start date, the Oura uses temperature tracking to provide insight into your fertility.
Typically, a slight rise in temperature indicates that ovulation has occurred, and a sustained temperature increase may mean pregnancy.
The Oura ring comes with a free 1-month free membership to the Oura app for new members. You’ll need the app to access your data (the app costs $6 per month after the free trial ends).
Nonmembers can still use the Oura app to access the personalized sleep, readiness, and activity scores that the app prepares daily using the ring’s input from 20 biometric signals in your body.
The sizing of the Oura Ring is different from standard U.S. ring sizes. Therefore, it’s important to take advantage of the sizing kit that comes with every order.

In addition to tracking metrics like your  daily steps , distance, calories burned, and heart rate, the Fitbit Charge 5 has a built-in EDA Scan app for  stress management , which takes just 2 minutes and measures small electrical changes in your sweat.
Plus, the device provides a Daily Readiness score using your heart rate variability, sleep, and recent activity level.
The Daily Readiness score tells you whether your body is up for a high intensity workout or you need to take a break and opt for a yoga or  meditation session  instead.
You can also enable Fitbit Pay, log your food and water intake, and receive alerts on your menstrual cycle, including your fertile windows and the expected date of your next period.
Plus, the tracker has:
built-in GPS
an ECG app
robust sleep tracking
up to 7 days of battery life

It’s also waterproof up to 164 ft (50 m).
The only downside is you can pair the Charge 5 with music streaming apps only if you have a Fitbit Premium account.

Product comparison
All the fitness trackers on our list have heart rate tracking and sleep tracking, but each one has additional characteristics that you may find helpful.
Here’s a quick comparison of our top picks:
Keep in mind that the prices listed above are based on the current list price and may vary by retailer.

How to choose the best activity tracker for your needs
When picking a fitness tracker that suits your needs, be sure to consider which features and functions are important to you.
For example, some products are specifically designed for certain sports and activities, such as:
running
biking
swimming
Others offer a variety of sport-specific modes.
Certain devices may include additional features such as:
GPS navigation
sleep tracking
menstrual cycle tracking
smartphone integration
heart rate monitoring
There are also many types of fitness trackers available, including:
smartwatches
armbands
rings
chest straps
clip-on trackers
Price is another key factor to keep in mind, as fitness trackers can vary quite a bit in terms of price.
Look for a product that’s within your budget and remember to account for additional costs, including any required accessories or subscriptions.

What are the benefits of wearing a fitness tracker?
Wearing a fitness tracker is a motivating way to monitor different aspects of your health all in one place and to find out how your body is responding to your workouts. Plus, most trackers now monitor:
sleep (both duration and quality)
menstrual cycles
stress
Some wearables can even remind you to take a few deep breaths when stress is running high.
If you’re working toward a particular fitness goal, just wearing a device can be motivating. In fact, research has shown that regularly wearing a fitness tracker can  help with weight loss  and  increase motivation to move .
One  small study observed that women , in particular, find wearable devices that offer the following helpful:
challenges
leaderboards
information on general health
helpful and motivating notifications

Frequently asked questions about fitness trackers
A fitness tracker will help you keep track of your health and exercise via workout tracking and biometric sensors. A fitness watch does all this but also has connectivity so that it can deliver notifications and updates from your paired smartphone.
Advanced fitness watches even have microphones and speakers that let you take calls and access the Internet directly from the watch.
Research suggests  that fitness trackers can increase your motivation to exercise and progress toward your fitness goals.
They can also help you monitor your health and engage in wellness practices. High end models help you navigate and stay safe on long treks or expeditions.
But fitness trackers can have downsides. They can be costly in terms of both money and time. Some people lament that they now have one more screen to check and are developing a preoccupation with numbers and sensor readings.
There are also privacy concerns over the large amounts of personal data gathered and health concerns over the extremely low radiation (ELF) that the devices emit. But the radiation from fitness trackers is less than that of most smartphones, and companies are going to great lengths to keep gathered health information secure.
If you can support the costs and discipline yourself to use your tracker as a tool and not a distraction, a fitness tracker may be a good way to advance both your physical and your mental health.
If you’re looking for the Fitbit with the most robust features, the Fitbit Sense 2 and Charge 5 are solid choices because they both have stress management and ECG capability plus more standard offerings that track:
menstrual cycle
activity
sleep
heart rate
Some studies  have found the Apple Watch and Garmin watches to be more accurate for measuring heart rate than Fitbit trackers, although this varies depending on the device. The  step counts  provided by the Apple Watch, Garmin watches, and Fitbit devices are  generally considered accurate .
Many fitness trackers tend to  overestimate daily energy expenditure  and may not accurately assess different stages of sleep, but they can  help give you an idea  of your overall activity levels and total sleep and wake times.
Garmin is known for making sport-specific watches and fitness trackers that are well liked by runners, swimmers, and cyclists.
Fitbit’s devices tend to focus more on tracking everyday activity levels, health metrics, and a wider variety of exercise types.
Whether Garmin or Fitbit is a better fit for you may depend on:
what kind of tracker you like to wear
the types of exercise you enjoy
which health metrics you want to track
The Fitbit Sense 2 and Charge 5 models are good options for an older woman. Both are comfortable and easy to use, and they offer similar health-tracking options. Where they differ is in their communication capabilities.
The Sense 2 has a built-in microphone and speaker, which means it’s possible to answer phone calls directly on the fitness tracker. The Charge 5 will notify you of the call, but you need to have your smartphone nearby to answer.
Also, the Sense 2 has an altimeter sensor that can track the number of floors you walk and built-in GPS that can track your workouts without a phone.
In general, the Sense 2 may be a better choice for an older woman who wants an advanced fitness tracker, whereas the Charge 5 is a more basic model for about half the price.

The bottom line
Fitness trackers can be a reliable tool to upgrade your workout and enhance your health.
A variety of options are available, and each one includes a unique set of features and functions.
When picking a product that’s right for you, be sure to consider factors such as the type of fitness tracker, sports modes, additional features, and price.
