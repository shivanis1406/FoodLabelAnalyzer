Title: 10 Benefits of Grape Seed Extract, Based on Science

Grape seed extract (GSE) is a dietary supplement made from the seeds of grapes. It has beneficial antioxidants that may help relieve stress, inflammation, and tissue damage that can occur alongside chronic diseases.
Grape seed extract (GSE) is a dietary supplement made by removing, drying, and pulverizing the bitter-tasting seeds of grapes.
Grape seeds are rich in antioxidants, including phenolic acids, anthocyanins, flavonoids, and oligomeric proanthocyanidin complexes (OPCs).
In fact, GSE is one of the best-known  sources of proanthocyanidins .
Due to its high antioxidant content, GSE can help prevent disease and protect against oxidative stress, tissue damage, and inflammation.
Note that grape seed extract and grapefruit seed extract are both marketed as supplements and abbreviated by the acronym GSE. This article discusses grape seed extract.
Here are 10 health benefits of grape seed extract, all based on science.

1. Can reduce blood pressure
Several studies have researched the effects of GSE on  high blood pressure .
A  review of 16 studies  in 810 people with high blood pressure or an elevated risk of it found that taking 100–2,000 mg of GSE daily significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure (the top and bottom number) by an average of 6.08 mmHg and 2.8 mmHg, respectively.
Those under the age of 50 with obesity or a metabolic disorder showed the greatest improvements.
The most promising results came from lower doses of 100–800 mg daily for 8–16 weeks, rather than a single dose of 800 mg or more.
Another study  in 29 adults with high blood pressure found that taking 300 mg of GSE daily lowered systolic blood pressure by 5.6% and diastolic blood pressure by 4.7% after 6 weeks.

2. Can improve blood flow
Some studies suggest that GSE may improve blood flow.
In an  8-week study  in 17 healthy postmenopausal women, taking 400 mg of GSE had blood-thinning effects, potentially reducing the risk of blood clots.
An  additional study  in 8 healthy young women assessed the effects of a single 400-mg dose of proanthocyanidin from GSE immediately followed by 6 hours of sitting. It was shown to reduce leg swelling and  edema  by 70%, compared with not taking GSE.
In the same study, 8 other healthy young women who took a daily 133-mg dose of proanthocyanidins from GSE for 14 days experienced 40% less leg swelling after 6 hours of sitting.

3. Could reduce oxidative damage
An elevated blood level of LDL (bad) cholesterol is a known risk factor for  heart disease .
The oxidation of LDL cholesterol significantly increases this risk and plays a central role in atherosclerosis, or the buildup of fatty plaque in your arteries.
GSE supplements have been found to reduce LDL oxidation triggered by high fat diets in several  animal studies .
Some  research in humans  shows similar results.
When 8 healthy people ate a  high fat  meal, taking  300 mg  of GSE inhibited the oxidation of fats in the blood, compared with a 150% increase seen in those who did not take GSE.
In  another study , 61 healthy adults saw a 13.9% reduction in oxidized LDL after taking 400 mg of GSE. However, a  similar study  was unable to replicate these results.
Additionally,  a study  in 87 people undergoing heart surgery found that taking 400 mg of GSE the day before surgery significantly reduced oxidative stress. Therefore, GSE likely protected against further heart damage.

4. May improve collagen levels and bone strength
Increasing flavonoid consumption may improve  collagen  synthesis and bone formation.
As a rich source of flavonoids, GSE may thus help increase your bone density and strength.
In fact,  animal studies  have found that adding GSE to either a low calcium, standard, or high calcium diet can increase bone density, mineral content, and  bone strength .
Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition that results in severe inflammation and the destruction of bone and joints.
Animal studies  have shown that GSE may suppress bone destruction in inflammatory autoimmune  arthritis .
GSE also significantly reduced pain, bony spurs, and joint damage in osteoarthritic mice, improving collagen levels and reducing cartilage loss.
Despite promising results from animal research, human studies are lacking.

5. Supports your brain as it ages
Flavonoids’ combination of antioxidant and  anti-inflammatory  properties are thought to delay or reduce the onset of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease.
One of the components of GSE is gallic acid, which animal and lab  studies  have shown can inhibit the formation of fibrils by beta-amyloid peptides.
Clusters of beta-amyloid proteins in the brain are characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease.
Animal studies have found that GSE may prevent  memory loss , improve cognitive status and  brain antioxidant levels , and reduce brain lesions and  amyloid clusters .
One  12-week study  in 111 healthy older adults found that taking 250 mg of GSE daily improved attention, language, and both immediate and delayed memory.
However, human studies on the use of GSE in adults with preexisting memory or cognitive deficits are lacking.

6. Can improve kidney function
Your kidneys are particularly susceptible to oxidative damage, which is often irreversible.
Animal studies  have shown that GSE may reduce  kidney damage  and improve function by reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory damage.
In  one study , 23 people diagnosed with chronic renal failure were given 2 grams of GSE daily for 6 months and then compared with a placebo group. Urinary protein decreased by 3% and kidney filtration improved by 9%.
This means that the kidneys of those in the test group were much better able to filter urine than the kidneys of those in the placebo group.

7. Can inhibit infectious growth
GSE displays promising antibacterial and antifungal properties.
Studies have shown that GSE inhibits the growth of common foodborne bacteria, including  Campylobacter  and  E. coli , both of which are often responsible for severe  food poisoning  and abdominal upset.
In  lab studies , GSE has been found to inhibit 43 strains of antibiotic-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  bacteria.
Candida is a common yeast-like fungus that can sometimes result in  candida overgrowth , or thrush. GSE is widely used in traditional medicine as a remedy for candida.
In  one study , mice with vaginal candidiasis were given an intravaginal GSE solution every 2 days for 8 days. The infection was inhibited after 5 days and gone after 8.
Unfortunately, human studies on GSE’s ability to help treat infections are still lacking.

8. May reduce cancer risk
The causes of cancer are complex, though DNA damage is a central characteristic.
A high intake of antioxidants, such as flavonoids and  proanthocyanidins , are associated with a  reduced risk  of various cancers.
The antioxidant activity of GSE has shown potential to inhibit human breast, lung, gastric, oral squamous cell, liver, prostate, and pancreatic cell lines in lab settings.
In  animal studies , GSE has been shown to enhance the effect of different types of chemotherapy.
GSE appears to protect against  oxidative stress  and  liver toxicity  while targeting chemotherapy action on the cancerous cells.
A  review of 41 animal studies  found that either GSE or proanthocyanidins reduced cancer-induced toxicity and damage in all but one of the studies.
Keep in mind that the anticancer and chemopreventive potential of GSE and its proanthocyanidins may not be directly transferable to people with cancer. More studies in humans are needed.

9. May protect your liver
Your liver plays an important role in detoxifying harmful substances introduced to your body through drugs, viral infections, pollutants, alcohol, and more.
GSE appears to have a protective effect on your liver.
In  test-tube studies , GSE reduced inflammation, recycled antioxidants, and protected against free radical damage during toxin exposure.
The liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is a key indicator of liver toxicity, meaning that its levels rise when the liver has sustained damage.
In  one study , 15 people with non-alcoholic  fatty liver  disease and subsequent high ALT levels were given GSE for 3 months. Liver enzymes were monitored monthly, and results were compared with taking 2 grams of vitamin C per day.
After 3 months, the GSE group experienced a 46% reduction in ALT, while the vitamin C group showed little change.

10. Enhances wound healing and appearance
Several  animal studies  have found GSE can aid wound healing.
Human studies show promise as well.
In  one such study , 35 healthy adults who had undergone minor surgery were given either a 2% GSE cream or placebo. Those using the GSE cream experienced full wound healing after 8 days, while the placebo group took 14 days to heal.
These results are most likely due to high levels of proanthocyanidins in GSE triggering the release of growth factors in the skin.
In another  8-week study  in 110 healthy young men, a 2% GSE cream improved  skin appearance , elasticity, and sebum content, which can help reduce the signs of aging.

Possible side effects
GSE is generally considered safe with few side effects.
Dosages of around 300–800 mg per day for 8–16 weeks have been found to be safe and well tolerated in humans.
Those who are pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid it, as there is insufficient data on its effects in these populations.
GSE may lower blood pressure, thin your blood, and increase blood flow, so caution is advised for those taking blood-thinning or blood pressure medications.
Furthermore, it  may reduce iron absorption , as well as improve liver function and drug metabolism. Consult your healthcare provider before taking GSE supplements.

The bottom line
Grape seed extract (GSE) is a dietary supplement made from the seeds of grapes.
It’s a potent source of antioxidants, particularly proanthocyanidins.
The antioxidants in GSE may help alleviate the oxidative stress, inflammation, and tissue damage that can occur alongside chronic diseases.
By supplementing with GSE, you’ll reap the benefits of better heart, brain, kidney, liver, and skin health.
