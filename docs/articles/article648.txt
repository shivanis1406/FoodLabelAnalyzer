Title: 6 Surprising Health Benefits of Sweet Potatoes

Sweet potatoes are nutritious, packing a good amount of vitamin A, vitamin C, and manganese into each serving. They also have anticancer properties and may promote immune function and other health benefits.
Sweet potatoes are sweet, starchy root vegetables that are grown worldwide ( 1 ).
They come in a variety of sizes and colors — including orange, white, and purple — and are rich in vitamins, minerals,  antioxidants , and fiber.
Not to mention, they provide a number of health benefits and are easy to add to your diet.
Here are 6 surprising health benefits of sweet potatoes.

1. Highly nutritious
Sweet potatoes are a great source of  fiber , vitamins, and minerals.
One cup, or 200 grams (g), of baked sweet potato with skin provides ( 2 ):
Calories:  180
Carbs:  41 g
Protein:  4 g
Fat:  0.3 g
Fiber:  6.6 g
Vitamin A:  213% of the Daily Value (DV)
Vitamin C:  44% of the DV
Manganese:  43% of the DV
Copper:  36% of the DV
Pantothenic acid:  35% of the DV
Vitamin B6:  34% of the DV
Potassium:  20% of the DV
Niacin:  19% of the DV
In addition, sweet potatoes — especially the orange and purple varieties — are rich in antioxidants that protect your body from free radicals ( 3 ).
Free radicals are unstable molecules that can damage DNA and trigger inflammation.
Free radical damage has been linked to chronic illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and aging. Therefore, eating  antioxidant-rich foods  is good for your health ( 4 ).

2. Promote gut health
The fiber and antioxidants in sweet potatoes can be beneficial for  gut health .
Sweet potatoes contain two types of fiber: soluble and insoluble ( 5 ).
Your body cannot digest either type. Therefore, fiber stays within your digestive tract and provides a variety of gut-related health benefits.
Certain types of  soluble fiber  — known as viscous fibers — absorb water and soften your stool. On the other hand, non-viscous, insoluble fibers don’t absorb water and add bulk ( 6 ).
Some soluble and insoluble fibers can also be fermented by the bacteria in your colon, creating compounds called  short-chain fatty acids  that fuel the cells of your intestinal lining and keep them healthy and strong ( 7 ).
Fiber-rich diets containing 20–33 g of fiber per day have been linked to a lower risk of colon cancer and more regular bowel movements ( 8 ,  9 ,  10 ).
The antioxidants in sweet potatoes may provide gut benefits as well.
Test-tube studies have found that antioxidants in purple sweet potatoes promote the growth of  healthy gut bacteria , including certain  Bifidobacterium  and  Lactobacillus  species ( 11 ,  12 ).
Greater amounts of these types of bacteria within the intestines are associated with better gut health and a lower risk of conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and infectious diarrhea ( 13 ,  14 ,  15 ).

3. May have cancer-fighting properties
Sweet potatoes offer various antioxidants, which may help protect against certain types of  cancers .
Anthocyanins — a group of antioxidants found in purple sweet potatoes — have been found to slow the growth of certain types of cancer cells in test-tube studies, including those of the bladder, colon, stomach, and breast ( 16 ,  17 ).
Similarly, mice fed diets rich in purple sweet potatoes showed lower rates of early-stage colon cancer — suggesting that the  anthocyanins  in the potatoes may have a protective effect ( 18 ).
Extracts of sweet potato peels have also been found to have anti-cancer properties in test-tube and animal studies ( 19 ,  20 ).
However, studies have yet to test these effects in humans.

4. Support healthy vision
Sweet potatoes are incredibly rich in  beta carotene , the antioxidant responsible for the vegetable’s bright orange color.
In fact, one cup (200 g) of baked orange sweet potato with skin provides more than double the amount of beta carotene that the average adult needs per day ( 2 ).
Beta carotene is converted to vitamin A in your body and used to form light-detecting receptors inside your eyes ( 21 ).
Severe  vitamin A deficiency  is a concern in developing countries and can lead to a special type of blindness known as xerophthalmia. Eating foods rich in beta carotene, such as orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, may help prevent this condition ( 22 ).
Purple sweet potatoes also seem to have vision benefits.
Older test-tube studies have found that the anthocyanins they provide can protect eye cells from damage, which may be significant to overall  eye health  ( 23 ).

5. May enhance brain function
Consuming purple sweet potatoes may  improve brain function .
One animal study found that the anthocyanins in purple sweet potatoes could help protect the brain by reducing inflammation and preventing free radical damage ( 24 ).
Another study found that supplementing with anthocyanin-rich sweet potato extract could reduce markers of inflammation and improve spatial working  memory  in mice, possibly due to its antioxidant properties ( 25 ).
No studies have been done to test these effects in humans, but in general, diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants are associated with a 13% lower risk of mental decline and dementia ( 26 ,  27 ).

6. May support your immune system
Orange-fleshed sweet potatoes are one of the richest natural sources of beta carotene, a plant-based compound that is converted to  vitamin A  in your body ( 28 ).
Vitamin A is critical to a healthy immune system, and low blood levels have been linked to reduced immunity ( 29 ).
It’s also key for maintaining healthy mucous membranes, especially in the lining of your gut.
The gut is where your body is exposed to many potential disease-causing pathogens. Therefore, a  healthy gut  is an important part of a healthy immune system.
Studies have shown that vitamin A deficiency increases  gut inflammation  and reduces the ability of your immune system to respond properly to potential threats ( 30 ).
No studies have been conducted to determine whether sweet potatoes, in particular, have an effect on immunity, but eating them regularly can help prevent vitamin A deficiency ( 31 ).

How to add them to your diet
Sweet potatoes are very easy to add to your diet.
They can be enjoyed with or without the skin and can be baked, boiled, roasted, steamed, or pan-cooked.
Their natural sweetness pairs well with many different seasonings, and they can be enjoyed in both savory and sweet dishes.
Some popular ways to enjoy sweet potatoes include:
Sweet potato chips:  Peeled, thinly sliced, and baked.
Sweet potato fries:  Peeled, cut into wedges or matchsticks, and baked.
Sweet potato toast:  Cut into thin slices, toasted, and topped with ingredients like nut butter or  avocado .
Mashed sweet potatoes:  Peeled, boiled, and mashed with milk and seasoning.
Baked sweet potatoes:  Baked whole in the oven until fork-tender.
Sweet potato hash:  Peeled, diced, and cooked with  onion  and peppers in a pan.
Spiralized sweet potatoes:  Cut into spirals, sautéed, and sauced.
In baked goods:  Sweet potato puree adds moisture without fat.
Preparing sweet potatoes with a little fat — such as  coconut oil , olive oil, or avocado — can help boost the absorption of beta carotene since it’s a fat-soluble nutrient ( 32 ).
Although cooking sweet potatoes slightly reduces their beta carotene content according to some older studies, they still retain at least 70% of this nutrient and are considered an excellent source ( 33 ,  34 ).

The bottom line
Sweet potatoes are nutrient-dense  root vegetables  that come in a variety of colors.
They’re high in fiber and antioxidants, which protect your body from free radical damage and promote a healthy gut and brain.
They’re also incredibly rich in beta carotene, which is converted to vitamin A to support good vision and your  immune system .
Sweet potatoes are versatile and can be prepared in both sweet and savory dishes, making them an exceptional carb option for most people.
