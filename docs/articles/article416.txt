Diet friendliness
Both Splendid Spoon and Daily Harvest are plant-based, vegan-friendly, and gluten-free. They also offer products that are suitable for other dietary needs.
When selecting your meals, both companies allow you to filter by diet type, such as  keto , low carb, and high protein. However, options for more restricted diets may be limited.
Additionally, many of Splendid Spoon’s items include  WW  (formerly Weight Watchers) points, and the company’s Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section provides a list of Whole30-compliant products.
Finally, neither company is a good fit if you have severe food allergies, as all of the items are prepared in facilities where cross contamination could occur.

Ingredients, taste, and freshness
Both companies prioritize the use of organic ingredients whenever possible, especially those on the “ Dirty Dozen ” list, which is a list of fruits and vegetables that are most likely to contain higher levels of pesticide residue.
Furthermore, all Splendid Spoon meals are made without the use of  genetically modified organisms (GMOs) .
To ensure optimal freshness and quality, all of Daily Harvest’s items arrive frozen.
Similarly, Splendid Spoon’s soups, noodles, and grain bowls are flash-frozen before shipping. Meanwhile, the smoothies and wellness shots are refrigerated.
Regardless of how they arrive, all of the meals and snacks from both companies can be frozen for longer storage.
Both companies regularly receive positive reviews for quality, with customers generally viewing the products as fresh and wholesome due to the quality of the ingredients used.

Effectiveness for weight loss
Although neither service is  explicitly designed to promote weight loss , you may lose weight if you include Splendid Spoon or Daily Harvest as part of a balanced,  reduced calorie diet .
In particular, both services make calorie counting easy, as they include nutrition information for all of their preportioned products.
What’s more, given that the meals are made with whole, minimally processed ingredients, they may be  more supportive of weight loss  than highly processed foods, which tend to be higher in calories and may promote weight gain ( 1 ).
Just keep in mind that each of Splendid Spoon’s items provides two snack-sized servings.
Therefore, if you consume the whole container, you’ll need to double the calories and other nutrients on the label to accurately track your intake.

Additional benefits
If you dislike cooking or have a busy lifestyle, using Splendid Spoon or Daily Harvest can make it significantly easier to stick to your dietary needs or preferences.
Given that convenient food options are especially limited for those following a vegan, gluten-free diet, these services will save you time by eliminating the need to cook and shop for every meal.
Additionally, as both meal deliveries incorporate a wide variety of ingredients, they can add some diversity to your meals.

Potential downsides
The major downside of these services is the price, as you’ll be paying at least $53–$65 per week.
Still, you may find that the convenience and quality of the food outweigh the cost.
A good way to try out these services without investing too much money is by trying an on-demand box from Splendid Spoon or 1 week of Daily Harvest.

Recommendation
Both Daily Harvest and Splendid Spoon are good options if you’re looking to eat more plant-based meals and can afford the service.
While Daily Harvest offers a broader selection of products, many of the items require additional prep work, including the smoothies, soups, Mylk products,  chia bowls , and lattes.
On the other hand, Splendid Spoon offers a smaller selection of foods, but they’re all ready to eat or drink cold or after a brief reheating.
In terms of cost, Daily Harvest is less expensive, with prices ranging from $5.99–$8.99 per item, compared with $9–$13 per Splendid Spoon meal.

The bottom line
Daily Harvest and Splendid Spoon are  plant-based meal delivery services  that provide high quality meals and snacks, including smoothies, grain bowls, and soups.
While Splendid Spoon’s meals require less prep work, Daily Harvest offers a larger selection of foods and is less expensive.
Regardless of which service you choose, you can be assured that you’ll be eating tasty meals made with high quality ingredients.
