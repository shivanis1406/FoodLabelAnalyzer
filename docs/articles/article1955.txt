Title: What Is Thai Tea? Everything You Need to Know About This Sweet, Spiced Delight

Thai tea is an iced and spiced black tea drink that can contain cardamom and star anise. Because of added sugar, it has a sweet taste, so it’s best to enjoy thai tea in moderation.
Thai tea is a worldwide favorite beverage at Thai restaurants, including those in the United States. It’s a culinary combo of Thai street tea and the Western love for sweetened and strongly flavored iced beverages.
Thai tea is iced black tea with milk and spices. It has a unique flavor profile that’s distinct from other teas: pleasant and earthy, enjoyed for its rich, sweet taste.
Since black tea contains strong groups of polyphenols with disease-fighting potential, Thai tea may offer some health advantages.
Plus, the spices in Thai tea are abundant in powerful antioxidants and plant compounds that have been shown to promote health and fight disease.
Thai tea can, however, be heavily sweetened with added sugar.
Read on to discover what Thai tea is and why people rave about it, as well as the science behind its ingredients and their potential health benefits.

What is Thai tea?
Thai tea, also known as Thai iced tea, is a spiced and iced black tea drink popular in Thailand and surrounding countries.
It has a distinctive orange-red color due to its spices — such as  star anise , cardamom, and tamarind seed — and red food coloring.
Thai tea can be prepared from loose black tea leaves or Thai tea bags, and it may be served hot instead of iced.
Sweetened condensed milk, or  evaporated milk  mixed with sugar, is added to Thai tea before chilling it. This gives it a creamy layer on top. Generally, you’ll detect earthy undertones, nutty overtones, and a punch of sweetness.
The ingredients can vary, but typically the tea is made with a Thai tea mix, which can be made at home or purchased from a Thai restaurant.

Thai tea nutrition
According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), an 8-ounce (240-mL) serving of Thai tea provides 154 calories and consists of a considerable amount of sugar ( 1 ).
Other nutrients include:
Protein:  1 gram
Carbohydrates:  31 grams
Fat:  2.8 grams
Fiber:  1 gram
Sodium:  64.8 milligrams
Sugar:  24 grams
Calcium:  6% of the recommended daily intake (RDI)
Iron:  2% of the RDI
Thai tea also contains  caffeine . Tea bags contain an estimated caffeine concentration of 218 mg/L ( 2 ).
The amount of caffeine in different brewed teas may vary, though. Caffeine content is determined by a variety of factors, including where and how the tea leaves were grown and processed and how the beverage is prepared.
Caffeine is a naturally occurring, brain-boosting stimulant that people all over the world consume. Although there is evidence that caffeine improves performance, it may have numerous side effects, including sleeplessness and  anxiety  ( 3 ,  4 ).
Thai tea contains a considerable amount of sugar. The amount of caffeine in a cup of brewed black tea varies, depending on how the tea is made. Caffeine is a stimulant that can improve performance but has side effects.

Thai tea health benefits
Thai tea may offer some health benefits, including anti-inflammatory potential, prebiotic functions, and more. These benefits can be attributed to the following components of Thai tea.
Black tea contains antioxidants and chemical compounds that may help decrease inflammation in the body. For this reason, it may provide a bunch of health benefits, including chronic disease prevention.
Clinical studies suggest that drinking black tea may  protect against diabetes  and heart disease and may support weight loss efforts ( 5 ).
In fact, black tea polyphenols (powerful, naturally occurring antioxidants) may aid in weight loss more effectively than green tea polyphenols, although green tea is more often lauded as a metabolism booster ( 6 ).

Lisa Andrews, a registered dietitian at  Sound Bites Nutrition , said black tea contains significant antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties.
“Black tea contains polyphenolic compounds, such as theaflavins and thearubigins, that may help protect against cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease,” Andrews told Healthline via email.
One review suggests that back tea polyphenols have a beneficial effect on obesity management ( 7 ).
However, more studies are necessary before a firm conclusion can be drawn regarding the impact of black tea consumption on weight.
The benefits of black tea extend further.
Based on recent research in rodents, the  gut microbiome  may benefit from black tea, according to Andrews.
“It’s been found to increase short-chain fatty acid production and the diversity of the gut microbiome, but reduce Lactobacillus bacteria in the gut of healthy rats,” she said.
The gut microbiome is made up of approximately 100 trillion microorganisms living in our bodies, and they all have different purposes. Some help fight disease, while others keep you healthy ( 8 ).
A diverse gut microbiome is more robust and resilient than having just one or two kinds of bacteria. And it may help you fight disease and stay healthier ( 8 ).
Tea has also been linked to other advantages, such as  brain health .
In fact, the antioxidant activity of tea polyphenols may reduce oxidative stress, which might aid in preventing Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease ( 9 ).
Oxidative stress occurs when cell-damaging, unstable oxygen atoms (commonly known as free radicals) interact with other cells in the body. People with accelerated free radical production may be at a higher risk of developing certain chronic health conditions ( 10 ).
Black tea contains antioxidants that help lower inflammation in the body, preventing chronic diseases and promoting brain health. The gut microbiome may also benefit from consuming black tea.
Cardamom  has a strong flavor and aroma. It can be used fresh or ground to give Thai tea its distinctive flavor.
“According to phytochemical analyses, cardamom contains several chemical compounds, including carbohydrates, proteins, minerals, lipids, essential oils, flavonoids, terpenoids, and carotenoids,” said Andrews.
Cardamom has been linked to improved diabetes management and  lower triglyceride  levels.
“A small study in subjects with diabetes found that cardamom supplementation aids in reducing Hba1c [average blood sugar level], insulin, and triglycerides,” Andrews explained ( 11 ).
Cardamom contains numerous chemical compounds, which may help with diabetes management and lowering triglycerides.
Star anise adds a  licorice  flavor to Thai tea, which cuts through the creamy sweetness.
Aside from its use as a spice, star anise is popularly used in traditional Chinese medicine for its antiviral properties ( 12 ).
“It’s a medicinal herb,” Andrews said, “with several health properties such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory.”
What’s more, star anise is also used in Western medicine to help combat influenza, Andrews explained.
“Star anise is the major source of shikimic acid, a main ingredient in the antiflu drug (Tamiflu),” she said.
More research is needed into star anise’s effects, though. It’s a good idea to talk with a medical professional if you’re not feeling well.
Star anise is a medicinal herb with antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties.
Fruit seeds, such as  tamarind  seeds, are high in biologically active phytochemicals (plant compounds with antioxidant properties) — especially flavonoids, anthocyanins, vitamin C, and carotenoids ( 13 ).
According to Andrews, tamarind seed polysaccharide (TSP) may have beneficial effects on bowel bacteria.
“TSP promotes beneficial bacterial growth,” she told Healthline, “which researchers believe may have prebiotic functions, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, and maintenance of the intestinal gut barrier” ( 14 ).
Prebiotics are a type of  dietary fiber  that nourishes the friendly bacteria in your gut, which may improve not only your digestive system but also your general health.
TSP may also be used as a thickening agent in food and medicinal products, Andrews explained.
“It’s been found in some studies to be a good substitute [for] or used in conjunction with hyaluronic acid for injection compounds for arthritis,” she said.
The tamarind seed has numerous biologically active compounds, which have been shown to have antioxidant properties and may also promote beneficial gut bacteria.

Potential downsides of Thai tea
Thai tea contains considerable amounts of  added sugar  — about six teaspoons — which may be harmful to your health if consumed regularly.
The 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans call for individuals to limit their intake of added sugars to less than 10% of their total daily calories. That means limiting added sugars to no more than 200 calories (approximately 12 teaspoons) in a 2,000-calorie diet ( 15 ).
Thai tea contains 50% of the daily recommended sugar intake in a single serving.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that Americans consume excessive added sugars, which may result in a number of health issues, such as increased weight,  heart disease , and type 2 diabetes ( 16 ).
Thai tea contains a high amount of sugar, which may lead to health concerns if consumed often.
Food dyes are color pigments developed to improve the appearance of food by giving it an artificial hue. They are produced using petroleum.
According to one older review, there are health issues associated with coloring Red 3. It has been shown to induce cancer in animals, and several other dyes have also been linked with cancer ( 17 ).
It’s worth noting that the presence of benzidine and other carcinogens (agents with the potential to cause cancer in humans) has been detected in three dyes:  Red 40 , Yellow 5, and Yellow 6 ( 17 ).
At least four colors (Blue 1, Red 40, Yellow 5, and Yellow 6) may cause hypersensitivity reactions ( 17 ).
Based on research in flies and test tubes, substantial chronic exposure to food dyes is not recommended throughout a person’s lifetime ( 18 ).
While the safety of food coloring is  still debatable , current usage in the United States appears to be safe ( 19 ).
Food dyes are artificial colors developed to make food more appealing, but some may cause cancer.

The bottom line
Thai tea is a spiced black tea beverage with a unique orange-red color, owing to a mixture of spices and artificial coloring.
It’s a sweet and creamy beverage made with milk and sugar.
Black tea has a variety of potent antioxidants and plant chemicals that may support health and help fight disease.
Nevertheless, Thai tea contains a significant amount of added sugar. One serving has 6 teaspoons, which is 50% of your daily added sugar intake.
That means you may want to enjoy Thai tea in moderation.
Try this today:  You can enjoy Thai tea in moderation as part of a healthy, balanced diet. I like to modify the traditional recipe by eliminating food coloring, and reducing added sugar by using  dates  instead — they’re great for sweetening it up!
Here’s  one modified Thai tea recipe  if you want to try making your own.
