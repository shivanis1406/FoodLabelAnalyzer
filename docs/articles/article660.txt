Title: What Is Bone Broth, and What Are the Benefits?

A healthy stock, bone broth contains nutrients like calcium. But nutritional value depends on factors like how it’s prepared and which bones you use.
Bone broth is one of the most popular trends in health and fitness right now.
Some people are drinking it to  lose weight , improve their skin, and nourish their joints.
This article takes a detailed look at bone broth and its health benefits.

What is bone broth?
Bone broth  is a highly nutritious stock that can be made by simmering animal bones and connective tissue.
Recipes for bone broth often include an acid-based product, such as vinegar or lemon juice.
This breaks down the collagen and connective tissue, and leaves you with a tasty, nutritious liquid commonly used in soups and sauces.
Bone broth has been getting a lot of buzz for the last few years among the health conscious. In fact, there are people who swear by drinking a cup each day.
You can make bone broth from any animal bones, but a few popular sources include:
chicken
turkey
lamb
pig
beef
wild game
fish
Any marrow or connective tissue can be used, including feet, beaks, gizzards, spines, legs, hooves, hocks, whole carcasses, or fins.
Bone broth is made by simmering animal bones and connective tissue. The resulting nutrient-dense liquid is used for soups, sauces, and health drinks.

What nutrients does bone broth contain?
The nutrient content of bone broth depends on the ingredients and their quality:
Bone.  The bone itself yields minerals like calcium and phosphorus.  Sodium , magnesium, and potassium may also be present.
Marrow.  Bone marrow gives you vitamins A, B2, B12, and E, plus  omega-3s , omega-6s, and minerals like calcium, iron, selenium, and zinc ( 1 ,  2 ).
Connective tissue.  This tissue provides glucosamine and chondroitin, which are popular dietary supplements for arthritis and joint pain.
Bones, marrow, and connective tissue are all largely made up of the protein collagen, which turns into gelatin when cooked.
Gelatin has a unique profile of amino acids and is particularly high in the amino acid  glycine  ( 3 ).
Bone broth contains many vitamins and minerals, which can be an important part of your diet.

How to make bone broth
Making bone broth is easy, and many people don’t even use a recipe.
All you really need are bones, vinegar, water, and a pot.
But if you’re not sure where to start, here’s a simple recipe you can follow:
Start to finish:  4 hours (or up to 24 hours)
2–3 lb. (1–1.5 kg.) chicken bones
1  onion  (optional)
4  garlic  cloves (optional)
4 liters (1 gallon)  water
2 tbsp.  apple cider vinegar
1 tsp.  salt  (optional)
1 tsp. pepper (optional)
Put bones and any vegetables into a large stock pot.
Pour water into pot so it covers bones and vegetables. Add vinegar, then bring to a boil over high heat.
Reduce heat, add salt and pepper, and let simmer 4–24 hours. The longer it simmers, the tastier and more  nutrient dense  it will be.
Allow broth to cool, then strain out the solids. Now it’s ready.
You can also add other meat, veggies, or spices to your broth. Popular additions include:
bay leaves
carrots
celery
ginger
lemon  rinds
liver
parsley
After it’s done, you can store the broth in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
Instead of a pot, you may want to use a pressure cooker, slow cooker, or Crockpot.
Bone broth is very easy to make, and all you need are a few simple ingredients.

Health benefits of bone broth
Bone broth is high in many different nutrients, which may provide some impressive health benefits.
For example, it contains:
high amounts of various minerals
the protein collagen
the amino acid glycine
the joint-improving nutrients glucosamine and chondroitin
Keep in mind that there aren’t any scientific studies that have looked at the benefits of bone broth directly.
However, based on its ingredients, bone broth may have the following potential health benefits:
Anti-inflammatory effects.  The glycine in bone broth may have some anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects ( 4 ,  5 ).
Weight management.  Bone broth is usually very low in  calories  but can still help you feel  full . This may be due to its gelatin content, which can promote satiety, or fullness ( 6 ,  7 ).
Joint health.  Glucosamine and chondroitin, found in the broth, may help to improve joint health and reduce symptoms of osteoarthritis ( 8 ,  9 ,  10 ).
Bone health.  Bone broth contains nutrients that are important for bone health, such as calcium.
Sleep and brain function.  Glycine has been shown to help improve sleep ( 11 ,  12 ,  13 ).
Bone broth contains a number of healthy and beneficial nutrients. It may have anti-inflammatory effects, can help improve bone and joint health, and may improve sleep quality.

Frequently asked questions
Here are answers to the most commonly asked questions about bone broth.
You can use bones from the previous night’s dinner or get them from your local butcher.
The best thing is that bones are cheap and sometimes free. You may be able to find butchers who will give them to you at no cost instead of throwing them away.
Not really. These are essentially the same thing — the terms are used interchangeably. However, bone broth can sometimes be thicker.
Ultimately, the nutrient content of bone broth depends on the quantity and quality of the ingredients. It also depends on the following factors:
which animal the bones come from and what that animal ate
how much bone is in the recipe you’re using
the length of time the broth cooks for
if the meat on the bone you’re using was previously cooked

The bottom line
Bone broth is high in many nutrients, some of which have health benefits.
