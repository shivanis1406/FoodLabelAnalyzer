Title: 4 Science-Based Benefits of Niacin (Vitamin B3)

Niacin is a type of B vitamin that offers benefits for you whole body, from your brain to your skin. You can get it from meat, fish, and nuts, or in supplement form.
Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is an important nutrient. In fact, every part of your body needs it to function properly.
As a supplement, niacin may help lower cholesterol, ease arthritis, and boost brain function, among other benefits.
However, it can also cause serious side effects if you take large doses.

What is niacin?
Niacin is one of the eight B vitamins, and it’s also called vitamin B3.
There are two main chemical forms of niacin:
nicotinic acid
niacinamide (sometimes called nicotinamide)
Both forms are found in foods as well as supplements.
The key role of niacin in your body is to synthesize the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which are involved in over 400 biochemical reactions in your body — mainly related to obtaining energy from the food you eat.
Niacin is  water-soluble , so your body does not store it. This also means that your body can excrete excess amounts of the vitamin through urine if they are not needed.
Your body gets niacin through food, but it also makes small amounts from the amino acid tryptophan, which can be found in protein sources like turkey and other animal foods.

How does it work?
As with all B vitamins, niacin helps convert food into energy by aiding enzymes.
Specifically, niacin is a major component of NAD and NADP, two coenzymes involved in cellular metabolism.
Furthermore, it plays a role in cell signaling and making and repairing DNA, in addition to acting as an  antioxidant .
These are  some of the symptoms  of niacin deficiency:
skin rash or discoloration upon exposure to the sun
bright red tongue
vomiting
constipation or diarrhea
depression
fatigue
headache
memory loss
loss of appetite
That said, deficiency is very rare in most Western countries. People who are malnourished — which may stem from HIV/, anorexia, liver failure, alcohol abuse, or other medical problems, or poverty — are most at risk.
Severe niacin deficiency, or pellagra, mostly occurs in developing countries, where diets are not as varied. It can be treated with niacinamide supplementation.

How much do you need?
The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for niacin depends on your age and gender. For ages 7 months and older, it is expressed as mg niacin equivalents (NE). One NE is equal to  1 mg  of niacin or  60 mg  of tryptophan.
0–6 months: 2 mg/day*
7–12 months: 4 mg NE/day*
*These figures represent the Adequate Intake (AI), similar to RDA, but it relies more on observation and approximations of healthy populations and less on scientific evidence.
1–3 years: 6 mg NE/day
4–8 years: 8 mg NE/day
9–13 years: 12 mg NE/day
Men ages 14 years and older: 16 mg NE/day
Women ages 14 years and older: 14 mg NE/day
Pregnant women : 18 mg NE/day
Breastfeeding women: 17 mg NE/day

4 health benefits of niacin
Niacin may help to improve your blood fat levels by:
increasing your HDL (good) cholesterol
reducing your LDL (bad) LDL cholesterol
reducing your triglyceride levels
This may translate to a decrease in heart disease risk, although  several   studies  have found no link between niacin supplementation and a decrease in heart disease risk or deaths.
It also takes high doses of niacin, typically  1500 mg or greater , to achieve blood fat level improvements, which increases the risk of experiencing unpleasant or potentially harmful side effects.
For these reasons, niacin is not a primary treatment for high cholesterol. It’s primarily used to help improve blood fat levels in people who cannot tolerate statin drugs.
One role of niacin is to release prostaglandins, or chemicals that help your blood vessels widen — improving blood flow and reducing blood pressure. For this reason, niacin may play a role in the prevention or treatment of high blood pressure.
In one  observational study  of over 12,000 adults, researchers found that each 1 mg increase in daily niacin intake was associated with a 2% decrease in high blood pressure risk — with the lowest overall high blood pressure risk seen at a daily niacin intake of 14.3 to 16.7 mg per day.
An older  high quality study  also noted that single doses of 100 mg and 500 mg of niacin slightly reduced right ventricular systolic pressure.
However, more research is needed to confirm these effects.
Your  brain  needs niacin — as a part of the coenzymes NAD and NADP — to get energy and function properly.
In fact, brain fog and even psychiatric symptoms are  associated with  niacin deficiency.
Some types of schizophrenia can be treated with niacin, as it helps undo damage to brain cells that’s caused by a niacin deficiency.
Preliminary research  shows that it could also help keep the brain healthy in cases of Alzheimer’s disease. However,  results are mixed .
Niacin helps  protect skin cells  from sun damage, whether it’s used orally or applied as a lotion.
It may help prevent certain types of skin cancer as well. One  high quality study  in over 300 people at high risk of skin cancer found that taking 500 mg of nicotinamide twice daily reduced rates of nonmelanoma skin cancer compared to a control.

Top food sources
Niacin is found in a variety of foods, especially meat, poultry,  fish , nuts, and legumes. Some foods may also be fortified with niacin and other vitamins, like breakfast cereals.
Some  energy drinks  also list doses — sometimes high — of B vitamins.
Here are some common food sources of niacin, along with  how much  of the Daily Value (DV) they provide:
grilled chicken breast, 3 ounces:  64% of the DV
roasted turkey breast, 3 ounces:  63% of the DV
cooked brown rice, 1 cup:  33% of the DV
dry roasted peanuts, 1 ounce:  26% of the DV
medium baked potato:  14% of the DV

Safety and side effects
There’s no danger in consuming niacin in the amounts found naturally in food.
However, supplemental doses can have various side effects, including nausea, vomiting, and liver toxicity.
Of particular note is one side effect known as niacin flush. This can occur when taking 30–50 mg or more of supplemental niacin in a single dose. It causes a reddening of the skin along with burning or itching sensations.
While niacin flush in and of itself isn’t typically harmful, it may be accompanied by other unpleasant side effects like headache or low blood pressure.
Even higher doses may cause liver damage or other severe side effects.
Before starting a niacin supplement, you should speak with a trusted healthcare professional.

Should you supplement?
Everyone needs niacin, but most people can get enough from their diet alone.
However, if you are deficient or have another condition that may benefit from higher doses, your doctor may recommend a supplement.
In particular, niacin supplements may be recommended for people with high cholesterol and heart disease risk factors but cannot take statins.
Supplemental forms are prescribed in doses that are much higher than the amounts found in food.
Since large amounts have many possible side effects, consult with a healthcare professional before taking niacin as part of any supplement. Also, keep in mind that the  FDA  does not regulate supplements in the same way it does drugs.

The bottom line
Niacin is one of eight  B vitamins  that are important for every part of your body.
Luckily, you can get all the niacin you need through your diet.  Foods that provide niacin  include meat, fish, and nuts.
However, supplemental forms are sometimes recommended to treat certain medical conditions, including high cholesterol.
If you think you may need to take niacin, it’s always best to consult with a healthcare professional first.
Try this today:  Concerned you may not be getting enough niacin? Keep a log of your food intake for a day or two. If you regularly eat animal protein, nuts, seeds, or niacin-fortified foods, you are probably getting enough. If not, you may want to speak with a healthcare professional about supplementation.
