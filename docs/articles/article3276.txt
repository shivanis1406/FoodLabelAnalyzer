Title: What Foods Cause Inflammation?

High intake of foods like refined carbohydrates, processed meats, and alcohol can lead to inflammation. Chronic inflammation increases your risk of metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease.
Inflammation is your body’s natural way of responding to injury. A diet high in certain foods can cause long-term inflammation, which contributes to some chronic health conditions.

Sugar-sweetened foods
A high intake of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages  can impair immune function , leading to chronic inflammation.
Over time, excess sugar intake can also lead to conditions like obesity and metabolic syndrome.
A  2024 study  suggests  a bidirectional relationship between inflammation and  metabolic disorders . Conditions  like obesity or  insulin resistance  may also contribute to inflammation, reinforcing the cycle.
Foods and beverages  high in added sugar  include:
sodas
sweetened fruit and coffee drinks
desserts like cookies, brownies, ice cream, and pastries
candy
sugary breakfast cereals

Refined carbohydrates
Refined carbohydrates  are foods that have had most of their fiber removed.
Fiber helps promote fullness, improves  blood sugar management , and feeds beneficial bacteria in your gut.
Refined carbs digest more quickly and are easier to overeat. As a result, they  can contribute  to excess body fat and metabolic issues, causing inflammation.
Foods high in refined carbohydrates include:
white bread
white rice
pasta
cereals
pastries

Red and processed meats
Red and processed meats are higher in saturated fats than other animal food sources. These include foods like:
beef
pork
hot dogs
deli meats
sausages
Because these foods are higher in fat, consuming a lot of them may cause weight gain.
Previous studies  suggest that compounds produced when cooking meats at high temperatures lead to inflammation. However, a recent  cross-sectional study  found that the link between consuming processed meats and inflammation may be due to excess body weight.
Although a diet high in red and processed meats may contribute to inflammation through weight gain, more research is needed to understand their impact on inflammatory markers.

Fried foods
When food is fried, some of the water it contains is replaced with fat. This increases its calorie content, which can contribute to inflammation.
Many  fried foods  are cooked with vegetable oils containing omega-6 fatty acids, like canola, corn, and soybean oils.
Omega-6s  are essential fatty acids that you can only get through your diet. They are different from omega-3s, which occur naturally in some plant oils and fatty fish like salmon. Consuming high amounts of omega-6s and low amounts of omega-3s may contribute to inflammation.
However,  research from 2021  indicates that omega-6 fats may have a protective effect when consumed in moderation.
Consuming fried meats may contribute to inflammation by influencing the gut microbiome.
A  2021 randomized controlled trial  found that consuming fried meats can lead to changes in gut microbiota associated with increased levels of systemic inflammation.
Frying plant-based foods leads to the formation of acrylamide, a substance  linked to  increased cancer risk. However, the relationship between dietary acrylamide and cancer risk is  still unclear .

Alcohol
Excess alcohol intake  can cause  cell damage that disrupts your body’s immune response, leading to chronic inflammation.
While the  Dietary Guidelines for Americans  doesn’t recommend consuming alcohol in any amount, limiting your intake to the following amounts may help reduce your risks:
two drinks or less per day for men
one drink or less per day for women
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides more information on  standard drink sizes  for men and women.

The bottom line
Diets high in processed foods, fats, and alcohol can contribute to chronic inflammation.
Short-term inflammation is your body’s natural response to injury. However, chronic inflammation contributes to conditions like metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.
