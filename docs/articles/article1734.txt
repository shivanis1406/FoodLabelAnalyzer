Title: Is Pizza Safe to Eat with Diabetes?

If you have diabetes, you’ve probably heard that you should avoid or reduce certain foods and drinks from your diet, including sugary beverages, refined grains, and candy. But what about pizza? Is it safe to eat?
It’s best for everyone, not just those with diabetes, to follow a nutrient-dense diet that prioritizes whole foods and contains plenty of protein, healthy fat, and fiber.
That said, on occasion, people with diabetes can enjoy foods that are often viewed as “unhealthy,” including pizza.
This article explains how people with diabetes can safely eat pizza and provides tips for healthy eating habits for those with diabetes.

Is pizza safe for people with diabetes?
The short answer: Yes, people with diabetes can enjoy all types of  pizza .
However, it’s a good idea for all people, not just those with  diabetes , to limit their intake of pizza. Here’s why.
Regardless of whether you have diabetes, healthcare professionals generally recommend limiting your intake of refined carbs, including the white flour used to make pizza crust.
But people with blood sugar management issues, such as those with diabetes, need to be particularly mindful of the amounts of refined and total carbs they’re consuming.
Refined grains are stripped of certain nutrients like protein and fiber, and they have a greater effect on blood sugar levels.
On the other hand, whole, unrefined grains or other nutrient-dense carb sources, such as fiber-rich fruits and starchy vegetables,  tend  to affect blood sugar levels less.
What’s more,  research  has linked diets high in refined carbs and  ultra-processed foods  like frozen pizzas with the following:
an increased risk of type 2 diabetes
higher fasting blood sugar levels
higher hemoglobin A1c, which is a marker of long-term blood sugar management
In general, if you have diabetes, it’s a good idea to monitor your total carb intake, including the types of carbs you’re consuming. This is because carbs are the macronutrient that has the greatest effect on your blood sugar levels.
Depending on the type, one slice of cheese pizza, which is around 100 grams (g), can have around  30 g , or two servings, of carbs while providing a moderate amount of protein and minimal fiber.
Keep in mind that the carb content of a pizza slice can be much higher depending on the thickness of the crust, the size of the slice, and the toppings.
So, if you were to eat two slices of cheese pizza, you could be consuming around four servings, or 60 g, of carbs, which can be a significant amount of refined carbs in one sitting.
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends getting  45–65%  of total daily calories from carbohydrates. For someone who eats 2,000 calories, this calculates out to 225–325 g carbs daily.
Pizza can be very high in sodium, which can be an issue for some people, especially those with diabetes.
For example, two slices (200 g) of Pizza Hut cheese pizza contain  1,248 milligrams (mg)  of sodium, which is more than 50% of the recommended daily sodium limit of  2,300 mg .
This is a concern because people with type 2 diabetes are more likely to have high blood pressure, which high salt intake  can affect .
The same two slices (200 g) of Pizza Hut cheese pizza deliver  10 g  of  saturated fat , or half of the  daily recommended limit  for someone following a 2,000-calorie diet.
A diet high in saturated fat  may also worsen  diabetes by contributing to  insulin resistance , which impairs blood sugar management.
However, this doesn’t mean people with diabetes have to avoid pizza altogether.
It simply means you should consider moderating your intake of pizza, as well as other foods rich in refined carbs, and that the majority of your diet should comprise whole,  nutrient-dense foods .
People with diabetes don’t have to avoid pizza. However, it’s a good idea to moderate your pizza intake as part of a nutrient-dense, balanced diet.

What are the best types of pizza for people with diabetes?
To be clear, a person with diabetes can safely have any type of pizza they want on occasion, even if it’s not the most “nutritious” option.
However, in general, it’s best for people with diabetes (and everyone else) to consume mostly whole, nutrient-dense foods, including vegetables, fruits, and lean protein sources, like fish and chicken as well as beans, nuts, and seeds.
When choosing carbs, it’s best to go for nutrient-dense carb sources most of the time. These include fruits, non-starchy vegetables, and whole grains, such as oats, brown rice, and buckwheat.
If you order pizza, there are some ways to make your slice a bit more nutritious and blood sugar–friendly.
When deciding on a slice, opt for toppings like these:
For fiber:  grilled veggies, including zucchini, peppers, olives, artichokes, and sun-dried tomatoes
For protein:  roasted chicken, fresh mozzarella
For healthy fats:  olives, pine nuts
Choosing a whole grain crust or a crust made with almond flour or  cauliflower  can also boost your fiber intake.
Plus, a crust made with  almond flour  or vegetables like cauliflower tends to be much lower in carbs than regular pizza. It will affect your blood sugar less significantly than crusts made with white or whole wheat flour.
Choosing a thin crust option over a regular pan/thick crust can also help slightly reduce carb intake as well.
Just keep in mind that certain low carb pizzas, such as those advertised to people on keto diets, can be very high in calories because they’re typically much higher in fat than regular pizza.
It’s perfectly healthy to enjoy a slice of your favorite pizza on occasion, even if it contains ingredients like extra cheese or pepperoni.
That said, if you want to make your slice healthier, it’s best to limit certain ingredients.
Here are some ingredients to consider watching out for:
processed meats  like bacon, ham, and sausage
fried chicken and fried vegetables, like fried eggplant
extra cheese topping and cheese-stuffed pizza crusts
sweet toppings like barbecue sauce and sweetened pineapple chunks
extra-thick crusts and deep dish–style pizzas
creamy, high calorie sauces like Alfredo sauce and ranch dressing
Many specialty pizzas contain one or more of these ingredients, which can significantly increase the carb content and overall calorie load of your slice.
For example, two large slices of Papa John’s The Works Pizza contain roughly  80 g  of carbs and 730 calories. Plus, at 1,744 mg of sodium, this meal has 75% of the recommended daily sodium limit.
Also, be mindful of the size of your pizza slice. Even though frozen pizzas and chain restaurants have set slice sizes, independently owned pizzerias may cut very large slices, which contain more carbs and calories per slice.
To make your slice a bit more nutritious, limit ingredients like processed meats, stuffed crusts, and creamy sauces. Instead, add nutrient-dense toppings like vegetables and grilled chicken.

Healthy tips for pizza lovers
If you’re a pizza lover and have diabetes, you don’t have to give up your favorite cheesy food.
