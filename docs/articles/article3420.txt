Title: What Is Mulberry Leaf? All You Need to Know

Mulberry trees produce flavorful berries that are enjoyed around the world. For centuries, its leaves have been used in traditional medicine as a natural treatment for a variety of conditions.
Mulberry levels are rich in plant compounds like polyphenol antioxidants, as well as vitamin C, zinc, calcium, iron, potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium.
This article reviews mulberry leaf, examining its uses, benefits, and potential side effects.

How is mulberry leaf used?
Mulberry (Morus) belongs to the Moraceae plant family and includes several species, such as the black mulberry (M. nigra), red mulberry (M. rubra), and white mulberry (M. alba).
Many people consume mulberry leaves without experiencing adverse effects.
They’re commonly used to make  tinctures  and  herbal teas , which are a common health beverage in Asian countries. Young leaves can be eaten after cooking.
You can also take mulberry leaf supplements, which have become increasingly popular for their potential health benefits.

Potential health benefits of mulberry leaf
A  2023 review  found reports that compounds found in mulberry leaves may help lower blood sugar, cholesterol, and inflammation levels. However, more research is necessary to assess the efficacy of mulberry leaf and its extracts in treating these conditions fully.
While some people may find benefits from using herbal remedies alongside doctor-recommended treatments, their use should never replace medical therapies.
Mulberry leaves provide several compounds that may help combat diabetes. These include 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), which prevents the absorption of carbs in your gut.
In one  2017 placebo-controlled study , 37 adults ingested maltodextrin, a starchy powder that rapidly boosts blood sugar levels. They were then given mulberry leaf extract containing 5% DNJ. Those who took either 250 or 500 mg of the extract experienced a significantly lower rise in blood sugar and insulin levels than the placebo group.
Another  study from 2017  reported that over a 3-month period, people with type 2 diabetes who took 1,000 mg of mulberry leaf extract 3 times daily with meals experienced significant reductions in post-meal  blood sugar levels , compared with a placebo group.
However, it is important to note that further study is necessary to fully assess the efficacy of mulberry leaf and its extracts as a complementary diabetes treatment.
Some research suggests that mulberry leaf extract may improve  heart health  by reducing cholesterol and blood pressure levels, decreasing inflammation, and preventing atherosclerosis — a buildup of plaque in your arteries that can lead to heart disease.
For example, a  2018 review  reports that compounds found in the mulberry leaf may have several different positive effects, including:
aiding blood sugar management
managing cholesterol levels
reducing  oxidative stress
reducing  inflammation
lowering blood pressure
However, it is important to note that many of the studies cited in the review are older and may include test tube and animal studies rather than controlled human trials. As a result, while this potential therapy area may be promising, there is a current lack of high-quality clinical evidence supporting the use of mulberry leaf and its compounds for these means.
For example,  animal studies  indicate that this leaf may prevent atherosclerosis, reduce cellular damage, and lower blood pressure, all of which are risk factors for heart disease. However, these effects have not been appropriately replicated in controlled human studies.
Mulberry leaves contain numerous anti-inflammatory compounds, including  flavonoid antioxidants .  Some research suggests that mulberry leaf may combat inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which are linked to chronic disease.
For example, a  2018 study in mice on high fat diets  demonstrated that supplements from this leaf  reduced inflammatory markers  like C-reactive protein, as well as oxidative stress markers like superoxide dismutase.
Although these results are encouraging, human studies are needed.
Although research is limited, mulberry leaf may offer several other health benefits. These include:
Anticancer effects:  Some  test-tube research  links this leaf to  anticancer activity  against human cervical and liver cancer cells.
Liver health:  Test-tube and animal studies have determined that mulberry leaf extract may protect liver cells from damage and reduce liver inflammation.
Weight loss:   Rodent studies  note that these leaves may increase fat burning and promote  weight loss .
Consistent skin tone:   Test-tube research from 2016  suggests that mulberry leaf extract may prevent hyperpigmentation — or patches of dark skin — and naturally lighten skin tone.

Mulberry leaf precautions
Although mulberry leaf has largely been shown to be safe in both human and animal studies, it may lead to side effects in some people. For example, some  people have reported  adverse effects, such as diarrhea, nausea, dizziness,  bloating , and constipation, when taking supplements.
Additionally, individuals taking diabetes medications should consult a health professional before trying mulberry leaf due to its  effects on blood sugar .
It’s always a good idea to consult your healthcare professional before using any herbal supplement, especially if you take medications or have a health condition.

The bottom line
Mulberry leaves have long been used in traditional medicine and people often associate it with several health benefits. However, high quality research assessing these benefits is limited.
It is important to always speak with a doctor before taking herbal remedies. In addition, these remedies should never take the place of traditional medical treatments.
