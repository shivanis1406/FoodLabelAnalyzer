Title: 11 High Cholesterol Foods: Which to Eat, Which to Avoid, and More

Certain high cholesterol foods, including eggs and full-fat yogurt, can benefit your overall health. But others, such as processed meats, may raise your risk for heart disease and other serious health conditions.
Cholesterol in food is often misunderstood. Eating healthy high cholesterol foods is actually not harmful to most people. Some of these foods are even loaded with important nutrients.
This article explains why you should not fear cholesterol and lists 7 healthy food options, as well as 4 to avoid.

1–7: Healthy foods that are high in cholesterol
Here are 7 high cholesterol foods that are incredibly nutritious.
Eggs  are one of the most nutritious foods you can eat, especially as a source of protein. They also happen to be high in cholesterol, with 1 large egg (50 grams [g]) delivering  207 milligrams (mg)  of cholesterol.
Research  suggests that eggs don’t raise cholesterol levels and that eating whole eggs may boost heart-protective high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, also known as “good” cholesterol.
There is also some  research  to suggest that levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (also known as “bad” cholesterol) may increase as egg consumption increases. However, eating 1–2  eggs per day  is perfectly  safe  for generally healthy people.
A single slice (22 g) of Swiss cheese provides around  20 mg  of cholesterol and is a good source of calcium and other nutrients.
One  12-week study  in 139 people found that eating 3 ounces (oz), or 80 g, of full-fat cheese per day, which is considered a high intake, didn’t raise LDL cholesterol when compared with the same amount of low fat cheese or an equal number of calories from bread and jam.
Shellfish — including  clams ,  crab , and shrimp — are excellent sources of protein, B vitamins, iron, and selenium.
A 3-oz (85-g) serving of canned shrimp provides  214 mg  of cholesterol. However,  research  indicates that people who eat more seafood may experience improved cognitive, visual, and cardiovascular health.
Pasture-raised steak  is packed with protein and important vitamins and minerals.
It’s lower in cholesterol than feedlot beef and  contains  significantly more  omega-3 fatty acids , which have anti-inflammatory properties.
A 4-oz (113-g) serving of pasture-raised steak has about  62 mg  of cholesterol.
Cholesterol-rich  organ meats  — such as heart, kidney, and liver — are highly nutritious.
For example, chicken heart is an excellent source of the powerful antioxidant  CoQ10 , as well as vitamin B12, iron, and zinc. A 1-cup (145-g) serving provides  351 mg  of cholesterol.
A  2017 study  of more than 9,000 Korean adults found that those with a moderate intake of unprocessed meat, including organ meats, had a lower risk of heart disease than those with the lowest consumption.
In addition to being loaded with nutrients, sardines are a convenient protein source.
One 3.75-oz (92-g) serving of these tiny fish contains  131 mg  of cholesterol. It also provides 63% of the Daily Value (DV) for vitamin D, 137% of the DV for vitamin B12, and 35% of the DV for  calcium .
Full-fat  yogurt  is a cholesterol-rich food packed with nutrients. One cup (245 g) of full-fat yogurt contains  31.8 mg  of cholesterol.
Research  associates increased intake of full-fat fermented dairy products with reduced LDL cholesterol and blood pressure and a lower risk of stroke, heart disease, and diabetes.

8–11: High cholesterol foods you should avoid
While certain cholesterol-rich foods are highly nutritious and can be beneficial to your health, others can be harmful. Here are 4 high cholesterol foods that are best to limit or avoid.
Fried foods , such as deep-fried meats and cheese sticks, are high in cholesterol and worth avoiding whenever possible.
That’s because they’re high in calories and may contain trans fats, which can increase heart disease risk and be  detrimental to your health  in many other ways. High intake of fried foods  has also been linked  to an increased risk of heart disease.
Fast food intake is a major risk factor for numerous chronic conditions, including heart disease,  diabetes , and obesity.
People who frequently eat fast food  tend to have  higher cholesterol, more belly fat, higher levels of inflammation, higher blood pressure, and impaired  blood sugar  regulation.
Processed meats , such as sausages, bacon, and hot dogs, are high cholesterol foods that you should limit in your diet.
A large review involving more than 614,000 participants associated each additional 2-oz (50-g) serving of processed meat per day with a  42% higher chance  of heart disease.
Cookies, cakes, ice cream, pastries, and other sweets tend to be high in cholesterol,  added sugars , unhealthy fats, and calories.
Research  has linked high added sugar intake to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, mental decline, and certain cancers. Plus, these foods often lack nutrients your body needs to thrive, such as vitamins, minerals, protein, and healthy fats.

What is cholesterol, and is it unhealthy?
Cholesterol is a waxy substance found in our bodies and in animal products such as meat, eggs, and dairy. It’s  important  for hormone production,  vitamin D  absorption, and production of bile to digest fats.
Your liver produces cholesterol, but you can also get it from eating animal-based foods. HDL (“good”) cholesterol helps your body excrete excess cholesterol, while LDL (“bad”) cholesterol is associated with plaque buildup in arteries.
When you consume extra cholesterol, your body  compensates by reducing  the amount it naturally makes. In contrast, when dietary cholesterol intake is low, your body increases cholesterol production to ensure that there’s always enough of this vital substance.
Research  suggests that  dietary cholesterol  doesn’t significantly affect cholesterol levels in your body. And research does not support an association between dietary cholesterol and heart disease in the general population.
Though dietary cholesterol may slightly affect cholesterol levels, this isn’t an issue for most people.
In fact,  two-thirds of the world’s population  experience little or no increase in cholesterol levels after eating cholesterol-rich foods — even in large amounts. A small number of people who are considered cholesterol non-compensators or hyper-responders appear to be more vulnerable to high cholesterol foods.
Dietary cholesterol  has also been shown  to beneficially affect the LDL-to-HDL ratio, which is considered the best indicator of  heart disease  risk.
While research shows that it’s unnecessary for most people to avoid dietary cholesterol, keep in mind that not all cholesterol-containing foods are healthy.

Healthy ways to lower your cholesterol levels
Having high levels of LDL cholesterol  may lead  to cholesterol buildup in your blood vessels, which may increase your risk of heart disease.
Certain lifestyle and dietary changes can lower your LDL levels and create a more favorable LDL-to-HDL ratio.
Here are healthy, evidence-based ways to lower your cholesterol levels:
Eat more fiber:   Research  shows that eating more  fiber  may help lower LDL cholesterol levels.
Increase physical activity:  Becoming more  physically active  is an excellent way to  lower  your cholesterol levels.
Try to lose weight:  Losing excess body weight  can help lower  your LDL levels.
Consider quitting smoking, if you smoke:  Smoking  raises  LDL cholesterol levels.
Eat more produce:  P eople who eat more fruits and vegetables  tend to have  lower LDL cholesterol levels .

Frequently asked questions
There is some  evidence  that dehydration may increase cholesterol levels, so making sure you drink enough water daily can certainly help.
There is some  evidence  that consuming caffeine can help your body clear out LDL cholesterol. You can learn more about the  link between coffee and cholesterol .
One banana contains about  5.3 g  of fiber, and eating more fiber has been shown to  help reduce  levels of LDL in the blood.
It will likely take 3–6 months for your cholesterol to go down after you make appropriate diet and lifestyle changes. You can learn more about the  time it takes to bring down your cholesterol .

The bottom line
Not all cholesterol-rich foods are created equal. While some, such as eggs and full-fat yogurt, are nutritious, others may harm your health.
Though it’s safe for most people to enjoy the healthy cholesterol-rich foods listed above, everyone should try to limit unhealthy high cholesterol foods such as fried foods, desserts, and processed meats.
Remember, just because a food is high in cholesterol doesn’t mean it can’t fit into a  balanced diet .
