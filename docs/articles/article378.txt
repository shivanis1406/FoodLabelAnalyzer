Title: 7 Surprising Benefits of Taro Root



Taro root tastes mildly sweet and is chock-full of nutrients. You can find fiber, potassium, magnesium, and many other vitamins and minerals in this vegetable.
Taro root is a starchy root vegetable originally cultivated in Asia but now enjoyed around the world.
It has a brown outer skin and white flesh with purple specks throughout. When cooked, it has a mildly sweet taste and a texture similar to potato.
Taro root is a great source of fiber and other nutrients and offers a variety of potential health benefits, including improved blood sugar management, gut and heart health.
Here are 7 health benefits of taro root.

1. Rich in Fiber and Other Important Nutrients
One cup (132 grams) of cooked taro has 187 calories — mostly from carbs — and fewer than one gram each of protein and fat ( 1 ).
It also contains the following:
Fiber:  6.7 grams
Manganese:  30% of the daily  value (DV)
Vitamin B6:  22% of the DV
Vitamin E:  19% of the DV
Potassium:  18% of the DV
Copper:  13% of the DV
Vitamin C:  11% of the DV
Phosphorus:  10% of the DV
Magnesium:  10% of the DV
Thus, taro root has good amounts of various nutrients that people often don’t get enough of, such as fiber, potassium,  magnesium  and vitamins C and E ( 2 ).
Summary  Taro  root is a good source of fiber and many vitamins and minerals that the standard  American diet frequently lacks.

2. May Help Control Blood Sugar
Although taro root is a starchy vegetable, it contains two types of carbohydrates that are beneficial for blood sugar management: fiber and  resistant starch .
Fiber is a carbohydrate that humans can’t digest. Since it’s not absorbed, it has no impact on blood sugar levels.
It also helps slow down the digestion and absorption of other carbs, preventing large  blood sugar spikes  after meals ( 3 ).
Studies have found that high-fiber diets — containing up to 42 grams per day — can reduce blood sugar levels by roughly 10 mg/dl in people with type 2 diabetes ( 4 ).
Taro also contains a special type of starch, known as resistant starch, that humans cannot digest and thus does not raise blood sugar levels. Roughly 12% of the starch in cooked taro root is resistant starch, making it one of the better sources of this nutrient ( 5 ).
This combination of resistant starch and fiber makes taro root a good carb option — especially for people with diabetes ( 6 ,  7 ).
Summary  Taro  root contains fiber and resistant starch, which both slow digestion and reduce  blood sugar spikes after meals.

3. May Reduce Your Risk of Heart Disease
The fiber and resistant starch in taro root may also help reduce your risk of heart disease.
Substantial research has found that people who  eat more fiber  tend to have lower rates of heart disease ( 8 ).
One study found that for every additional 10 grams of fiber consumed per day, the risk of dying from heart disease decreased by 17% ( 9 ).
This is believed to be due in part to fiber’s  cholesterol-lowering effects , but research is ongoing ( 10 ).
Taro root contains more than 6 grams of fiber per cup (132 grams) — more than twice the amount found in a comparable 138-gram serving of potatoes — making it an excellent source of fiber ( 1 ,  11 ).
Taro root also provides resistant starch, which lowers cholesterol and has been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease ( 7 ,  12 ).
Summary  Taro  root is high in fiber and resistant starch, which help lower cholesterol and  reduce your risk of heart disease.

4. May Offer Anticancer Properties
Taro root contains plant-based compounds called polyphenols that have various health benefits, including the potential to reduce cancer risk.
The main polyphenol found in taro root is quercetin, which also exists in large amounts in onions,  apples  and tea ( 13 ,  14 ).
Test-tube and animal studies have found that quercetin can trigger cancer cell death and slow the growth of several types of cancers ( 15 ).
It’s also a powerful antioxidant that protects your body from excessive free radical damage that has been linked to  cancer  ( 16 ).
One test-tube study found that taro extract was able to stop the spread of some types of breast and prostate cancer cells, but no human research has been conducted ( 17 ).
While early studies are promising, more research is needed to better understand the anticancer properties of taro.
Summary  Taro  root contains polyphenols and antioxidants that may combat cancer growth and  protect your body from oxidative stress. Yet, more research in this area is  needed.

5. May Help You Lose Weight
Taro root is a good source of fiber, containing 6.7 grams per cup (132 grams) ( 1 ).
Research has found that people who eat more fiber tend to have lower body weight and less body fat ( 18 ).
This may be because fiber slows stomach emptying, which keeps you fuller longer and reduces the number of calories you eat throughout the day. Over time, this may  lead to weight loss  ( 19 ).
The resistant starch in taro root may have similar effects.
One study found that men who took a supplement containing 24 grams of resistant starch before meals consumed roughly 6% fewer calories and had lower insulin levels after the meal, compared to the control group ( 20 ).
Animal studies have also shown that rats fed diets high in resistant starch had less total body fat and  belly fat . It’s hypothesized that this is partially due to resistant starch increasing fat-burning in your body, but further research is needed ( 21 ).
Summary  Due to  its high fiber and resistant starch content, taro root may increase feelings of  fullness, reduce overall calorie intake and increase fat burning, potentially  leading to weight loss and reduced body fat.

6. Good for Your Gut
Since taro root contains plenty of fiber and resistant starch, it may be beneficial to gut health.
Your body does not digest or absorb fiber and resistant starch, so they remain in your intestines. When they reach your colon, they become food for the  microbes in your gut  and promote the growth of good bacteria ( 22 ).
When your  gut bacteria  ferment these fibers, they create short-chain fatty acids that nourish the cells that line your intestines and keep them healthy and strong ( 23 ).
One study in pigs found that diets rich in resistant starch improved colon health by boosting short-chain fatty acid production and decreasing damage to colon cells ( 24 ).
Interestingly, human studies have found that people with inflammatory intestinal disorders, such as ulcerative colitis, tend to have lower levels of short-chain fatty acids in their guts ( 25 ).
Some research suggests that consuming fiber and resistant starch can boost these levels and help protect against inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer ( 26 ).
Summary  The  fiber and resistant starch in taro root are fermented by gut bacteria to form  short-chain fatty acids, which may protect against colon cancer and  inflammatory bowel disease.

7. Versatile and Easy to Add to Your Diet
Taro root has a starchy texture and mild, slightly sweet taste, similar to  sweet potato . It can be used in both sweet and savory dishes.
Some popular ways to enjoy it include:
Taro chips:  Thinly slice  taro and bake or fry into chips.
Hawaiian poi:  Steam and mash  taro into a purple-hued puree.
Taro tea:  Blend taro or  use taro powder in boba tea for a beautiful purple drink.
Taro buns:  Bake sweetened  taro paste inside buttery pastry dough for dessert.
Taro cakes:  Mix cooked taro  with seasonings and pan fry until crispy.
In soups and stews:  Cut taro into chunks and use in  brothy dishes.
It’s important to note that taro root should only be eaten cooked.
Raw taro contains proteases and oxalates that can cause a stinging or burning sensation in your mouth. Cooking deactivates these compounds ( 27 ,  28 ).
Summary  Taro  root has a smooth, starchy texture and mildly sweet taste. It can be cooked and  enjoyed in both sweet and savory dishes. You should not eat raw taro root as it  contains compounds that may cause a stinging or burning sensation in your  mouth.

The Bottom Line
Taro root is a starchy root vegetable with a mildly sweet taste.
It’s a great source of various nutrients that many people don’t get enough of, including fiber, potassium, magnesium and vitamins C and E.
Taro is also an excellent source of fiber and resistant starch, which account for many of its health benefits, such as improved heart health, blood sugar levels, body weight and gut health.
Taro also contains a variety of antioxidants and polyphenols that protect against free radical damage and potentially cancer.
Always cook the root before eating it to neutralize compounds that can cause unpleasant stinging sensations in the mouth.
When cooked, taro is a nutritious addition to both sweet and savory meals.
