Title: What Is the Glycemic Index of Sweet Potatoes?

The glycemic index (GI) of sweet potatoes varies depending on the cooking method used. Boiled sweet potatoes have a much lower GI than fried, roasted, or baked versions. The longer it is boiled, the lower its GI will be.
Sweet potatoes are a popular food enjoyed for their flavor, versatility, and potential health benefits.
Notably, cooking methods have a big effect on the way your body digests and absorbs them.
While certain techniques may have minimal impact on blood sugar levels, others can lead to dramatic spikes and crashes in blood sugar.
This article reveals how the glycemic index of sweet potatoes differs depending on how they’re cooked.

What is the glycemic index?
The  glycemic index  (GI) is a measure of how much certain foods increase blood sugar levels.
It scores foods on a 0–100 scale and ranks them as low, medium, or high ( 1 ).
Here are the score ranges for the three GI values:
Low:  55 or less
Medium:  56–69
High:  70 or above
Foods high in simple carbs or  added sugar  are broken down more quickly in the bloodstream and tend to have a higher GI.
Meanwhile, foods high in protein, fat, or fiber have less of an effect on blood sugar levels and typically a lower GI.
Several other factors may also influence GI value, including food particle size, processing techniques, and cooking methods ( 2 ).
The glycemic index (GI) measures the effects that certain foods have on blood sugar levels. Foods can have a low, medium, or high GI value depending on various factors.

Glycemic index of sweet potatoes
The way that foods are cooked can have a major impact on the glycemic index of the final product. This is particularly true of  sweet potatoes .
Boiling is thought to alter the chemical structure of the sweet potato, preventing spikes in blood sugar levels by allowing the starch to be more easily digested by enzymes in your body ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
When boiled, they’re also thought to retain more  resistant starch , a type of fiber that resists digestion and has a low impact on blood sugar levels ( 3 ,  6 ).
Boiled sweet potatoes have a low to medium GI value, with a greater boiling time lowering the GI.
For example, when boiled for 30 minutes, sweet potatoes have a low GI value of about 46, but when boiled for just 8 minutes, they have a medium GI of 61 ( 7 ,  8 ).
The roasting and baking processes destroy resistant starch, giving roasted or baked sweet potatoes a much higher glycemic index ( 3 ).
Sweet potatoes that have been peeled and roasted have a GI of 82, which is classified as high ( 9 ).
Other foods with a similar GI value include rice cakes and  instant oat porridge  ( 10 ,  11 ,  12 ).
Baked sweet potatoes have a significantly higher glycemic index than any other form.
In fact, sweet potatoes that have been peeled and baked for 45 minutes have a GI of 94, making them a high-GI food ( 13 ).
This puts them on par with other high-GI foods, including  white rice , baguettes, and instant mashed potatoes ( 14 ,  15 ,  16 ).
Compared with roasted or baked versions, fried sweet potatoes have a slightly lower glycemic index due to the presence of fat. This is because fat can delay the emptying of the stomach and slow the absorption of sugar in the bloodstream ( 3 ).
Still, when they’re fried they have a relatively high GI.
Although the GI value can vary, sweet potatoes that have been peeled and fried in  vegetable oil  typically have a GI of around 76 ( 17 ).
This puts them on par with cake, doughnuts, jelly beans, and waffles ( 18 ,  19 ,  20 ).
The GI of sweet potatoes varies based on the cooking method. While boiling gives a low to medium GI value, roasting, baking, and frying all give high GI values.

The bottom line
Sweet potatoes can have a low, medium, or high glycemic index depending on how they’re cooked and prepared.
Boiled sweet potatoes affect blood sugar levels far less than other varieties, such as fried, roasted, or baked versions. Longer boiling times reduce the GI further.
To support better  blood sugar control , it’s best to select healthy cooking methods and enjoy sweet potatoes in moderation.
