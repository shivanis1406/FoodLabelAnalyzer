Title: What Is Feverfew, and Does It Work for Migraine Attacks?

Feverfew is a plant known for naturally treating migraine. But research on whether it really works is mixed.
Feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) is a flowering plant of the Asteraceae family.
Its name comes from the Latin word “febrifugia,” meaning “fever reducer.” Traditionally, feverfew was used to treat fevers and other inflammatory conditions.
In fact, some people call it the “medieval aspirin” ( 1 ).
Feverfew contains various active compounds, such as flavonoids and volatile oils. However, its main compound of interest is parthenolide, which is found in the plant’s leaves.
Studies show that parthenolide may be behind most of the potential health benefits of feverfew ( 1 ).

The relationship between feverfew and migraine
For centuries, people have been taking feverfew to treat migraine.
Migraine attacks are moderate to severe  headaches  that affect one side of the head. They’re typically accompanied by throbbing, pulsating, or pounding pain ( 2 ).
In test-tube studies, compounds in feverfew, such as parthenolide and tanetin, helped stop the production of prostaglandins, which are molecules that promote inflammation ( 1 ).
Other test-tube studies show that parthenolide may inhibit serotonin receptors, prevent blood platelets from releasing inflammatory molecules, stop blood vessels in the brain from widening (vasodilation), and stop smooth muscle spasms ( 1 ,  3 ).
All of these factors have been linked to migraine ( 4 ,  5 ).
However, human studies on feverfew and migraine show mixed results.
In a review of six studies involving 561 people, four studies found that feverfew helped reduce the frequency and intensity of  migraine attacks , while two studies found no effect.
Additionally, the four studies that reported a beneficial effect showed that it was only slightly more effective than a placebo ( 6 ).
For instance, in a study with 170 participants, those taking feverfew experienced only 0.6 fewer migraine attacks per month than people in the placebo group ( 7 ).
Based on current research, feverfew appears to be only slightly effective against migraine attacks. More human studies are needed to draw solid conclusions.
Current research finds that feverfew is only slightly more effective than a placebo at treating and preventing migraine attacks. More studies are needed.

Other potential benefits
Aside from treating migraine attacks, feverfew may have other potential health benefits:
Anticancer effects:  Test-tube studies show that compounds in feverfew may inhibit certain cancer cells ( 8 ,  9 ,  10 ,  11 ).
Pain relief:   Anti-inflammatory  properties of feverfew may help relieve pain ( 12 ).
Elevated mood:  In studies in mice, feverfew helped reduce symptoms of  anxiety  and depression. However, there are no human studies on this topic ( 13 ).
Treating rosacea:  Topical creams containing parthenolide-free feverfew extract may help treat acne rosacea by reducing inflammation. Parthenolide can irritate the skin, which is why it’s removed from topical creams ( 14 ,  15 ).
Feverfew may offer several other potential health benefits. It’s associated with pain relief, elevated mood, improved rosacea, and anticancer effects.

Possible side effects
Feverfew is generally considered safe with few reported side effects ( 6 ).
However, studies have only looked into its short-term effects on the body. Long-term effects (longer than 4 months) have not been studied.
In some cases, feverfew may cause side effects like stomachaches, heartburn, diarrhea, constipation,  nausea , dizziness, tiredness, and menstrual changes ( 1 ).
Pregnant people should avoid taking feverfew, as it may cause early contractions. What’s more, research to ensure it’s safe to take while breastfeeding is insufficient ( 1 ).
People with allergies to ragweed or related plants from the Asteraceae or Compositae plant families, such as daisies, marigolds, and chrysanthemums, should also avoid it.
It’s best to consult a doctor first, as the supplement may interact with certain medications, particularly blood thinners and liver medications.
Feverfew is generally safe with few side effects, but some people should avoid it. If you have any concerns, it’s best to speak with your doctor or a pharmacist.

Dosage and recommendations
As of now, there’s no official recommended dosage for feverfew.
However, studies find that taking 100 to 300 milligrams (mg) of a feverfew supplement containing 0.2% to 0.4% parthenolide between one and four times daily may treat  migraine headaches  ( 1 ).
Feverfew is also available as fluid extracts or tinctures, which are typically used to  relieve arthritis . However, evidence to recommend it for this purpose is insufficient ( 16 ).
You can also try it as a tea, which is available in health food stores or online.
Keep in mind that feverfew is unsuitable for some people and those taking certain medications. If you have any concerns, speak with a doctor or pharmacist.
Though an official recommended dosage for feverfew is unavailable, taking 100 to 300 mg of a supplement containing 0.2% to 0.4% parthenolide one to four times daily appears to be most effective at treating or preventing migraine attacks.

The bottom line
Feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) is commonly used as a natural treatment for migraine.
However, current research shows it’s only slightly more effective than a placebo. More human studies are needed.
Feverfew has also been linked to pain relief,  anticancer properties , improved mood, and reduced acne rosacea.
This supplement is generally safe for most people, but if you have any concerns, it’s best to speak with a qualified healthcare professional, like your doctor or a pharmacist, before trying it.
