Title: 15 Healthy Dips and Spreads

Dips and spreads make excellent condiments, snacks, and party food.
However, they’re sometimes loaded with high calorie ingredients, salt, sugar, and other additives.
All the same, you don’t have to rely on store-bought products. At home, you can use whole foods to make your own varieties that are just as tasty but much more nutritious.
Here are 15 healthy dips and spreads — with recipes.
