Title: Calibrate Metabolic Reset: A Dietitian’s Expert Review


Healthline diet score: 4.2 out of 5
Dubbed “the metabolic approach to sustainable weight loss,” Calibrate is a new diet program designed to improve your metabolism for long lasting results.
Calibrate claims that it can help you lose weight using a combination of doctor-prescribed medications, individual video sessions with a health coach, and diet and lifestyle changes.
According to the company’s website, members lose an average of 15% of their body weight in 1 year. Members can get a refund if they do not lose 10% of their body weight after completing the program.
This article will take an in-depth look at Calibrate, including what it is, how it works, and whether it’s safe and effective.
Overall score:  4.2

BOTTOM LINE:  Calibrate offers a flexible weight loss solution for people who meet its strict list of eligibility criteria. It does not exclude any foods from your diet, includes personal coaching, and promotes healthy lifestyle habits. However, some may find it difficult to adhere to because it requires a long-term commitment, involves taking an injectable medication, and can be quite expensive.

What is Calibrate?
Calibrate was founded by former investment banker Isabelle Kenyon in 2020.
The company says that it aims to change the way the world treats weight management and claims that it can help boost weight loss by improving metabolic health.
Calibrate’s Metabolic Reset program features a curriculum focused on enhancing the “four pillars of metabolic health”: food, sleep, exercise, and emotional health.
Notably, the program stands out because it prescribes members  glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) medications , a type of medication that is used to treat diabetes and has been shown to suppress appetite ( 1 ).
The program also offers biweekly video calls with a health coach to help members make gradual lifestyle changes and support sustainable weight loss.

How does it work?
Metabolic Reset is a yearlong program that is divided into four levels: Learning, Practicing, Setting, and Sustaining.
Each level covers information on the “Four Pillars of Metabolic Health”: food, sleep, exercise, and emotional health.
Members have a biweekly video call with their personal Calibrate coach that is focused on one of these pillars and involves setting goals designed to foster long-term  healthy habits .
Members also fill out regular medical checkups throughout the program and can request a follow-up call with the medical team if needed.
The Learning level of Metabolic Reset lasts for the first 3 months of the program.
It involves meeting with a Calibrate coach every other week, setting goals, and reading 1–2 lessons per week on the app.
This level is intended to establish a foundation for the program and help you learn and understand the basics of  metabolic health .
During months 3–6, you will continue talking with a personal coach every other week to discuss your goals and progress.
This level also involves reading two lessons per week, which cover skills that were established during the Learning level of the program.
As you progress, the curriculum allows you to select “focus classes” in specific areas that interest you.
The next level is Setting, which takes place during months 6–9 of the program.
During this level, you will continue to have biweekly video calls with your Calibrate coach and read 1–2 lessons per week.
You can still select focus classes and set your own schedule regarding which pillars you’d like to work on.
Sustaining is the last level of the program, which occurs during months 9–12.
This level is intended to help you maintain the healthy habits you’ve worked on throughout the program by continuing to work with your coach and read weekly lessons.
As in the other levels of the program, you can still select focus classes to strengthen skills as needed.

What are GLP-1 medications?
Calibrate prescribes injectable GLP-1 medications to its members. These medications were originally developed to treat diabetes by altering the activity of GLP-1, a hormone that regulates the release of insulin and maintains blood sugar levels after eating ( 2 ).
Some GLP-1 medications, including semaglutide (Wegovy or Ozempic) and liraglutide (Victoza or Saxenda), have also been shown to  assist with weight loss .
When combined with dietary changes and physical activity, research suggests that these medications may promote weight loss in people with obesity by decreasing appetite, resulting in decreased food intake ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved both Saxenda and Wegovy for weight management in adults with obesity and adults with overweight who have at least one weight-related condition ( 8 ,  9 ).
While Saxenda has been approved since 2014, Wegovy was approved more recently, in June 2021 ( 8 ,  9 ).

Who is Calibrate for?
To be eligible for Calibrate, you must live in the United States, have commercial or employer insurance, and be 18–64 years old.
You must also have a body mass index (BMI) above 30, with or without other conditions, or have a BMI above 27 and one or more of the following conditions:
type 2 diabetes
prediabetes
high cholesterol
high blood pressure
heart disease
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
obstructive sleep apnea
polycystic ovary syndrome
Additionally, the program is not recommended for people who:
are nursing
are pregnant or planning to become pregnant within the next year
have an active eating disorder
have type 1 diabetes
have active gallbladder disease
are being treated for cancer
have a history of  medullary thyroid cancer  or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome
have undergone bariatric surgery in the past 18 months
have substance use disorder
have had pancreatitis in the past 6 months or have a history of pancreatitis caused by taking GLP-1 medications

How much does it cost?
Pricing for the Metabolic Reset program starts at $138 per month for 1 year, or $1,649 up front.
Your membership includes:
one-on-one biweekly video calls with a Calibrate coach
access to curriculum focused on food, sleep, exercise, and emotional health
ongoing access to Medical and Support teams
tracking tools and online resources on the Calibrate app
a welcome kit, which includes a smart scale and orientation tools
a 30-minute virtual visit with a doctor to review lab results
It’s important to note that the cost of the GLP-1 medication is not included.
The medication is often covered by insurance and typically costs around $25 per month with most commercial insurance plans after any deductible is met. However, some members may be responsible for paying a larger portion of the prescription cost.
Calibrate provides support in navigating your insurance coverage.

How to get started
Before signing up for Calibrate, you must complete a 2-minute quiz on the website to determine whether you are eligible.
The quiz collects basic information about you, including your location, date of birth, and sex assigned at birth.
It also asks questions about your body weight and medical history to help determine whether the program is a good fit.
If you’re eligible, you can sign up by entering your payment information and selecting whether you’d like to pay the full amount up front or pay in monthly installments.

What can you eat?
Unlike some other diet programs, Calibrate uses a flexible approach and does not restrict or eliminate any specific foods or food groups.
According to the website, the program can work with almost any dietary restrictions, including vegan, kosher, and gluten-free diets.
The company also notes that it aims to help users reduce their intake of  fast-digesting carbohydrates  — such as refined grains and foods high in added sugar — and enjoy a variety of foods rich in protein, fiber, and heart-healthy fats.
This may include nutrient-dense foods such as:
fruits
vegetables
whole grains
legumes
nuts and seeds
lean proteins
Calibrate does not require you to count calories or track macronutrients, which may be appealing in comparison to other diet plans.

Is it effective for weight loss?
According to Calibrate, members lose an average of 11% of their body weight after 6 months and 15% of their body weight upon completion of the 1-year program ( 10 ).
What’s more, the company recently published clinically validated results that show an average weight loss of 16.5% after 18 months for those who continued into a second program year ( 11 ).
Calibrate prescribes medications such as Saxenda and  Wegovy , which work by reducing appetite and food cravings, leading to decreased energy intake and weight loss over time ( 6 ,  7 ).
Furthermore, Calibrate encourages several diet and lifestyle habits that can support weight loss.
For instance, the program emphasizes the importance of eating  plenty of fiber  and protein, both of which have been shown to support weight loss efforts ( 12 ,  13 ).
The program also sets goals to help incorporate exercise into your daily routine, which may be beneficial for weight management ( 14 ).
Additionally, members are encouraged to aim for 7–9 hours of sleep each night during the Metabolic Reset program.
In one study published in 2021, better sleep health was associated with greater weight loss and fat loss during a 12-month weight loss intervention ( 15 ).
However, while certain components of the program may support weight loss, the only research on the effectiveness of the diet itself is Calibrate’s First Annual Results Report and the company’s updated report, which was clinically validated and presented at the Obesity Society’s annual ObesityWeek conference in 2022.
According to the company’s reports, after 1 year, members had lost an average of 15% of their body weight and an average of 6.4 inches from their waistlines. Other reported benefits include improvements in  A1C , fasting insulin, LDL (bad) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels ( 10 ,  11 ).
What’s more, the company’s most recent report shows that approximately 81% of members completed the 1-year program and 70% enrolled in a second year of the program ( 11 ).

Other potential benefits
In addition to supporting weight loss, Calibrate has a few other possible benefits.
Calibrate does not exclude any foods from your diet and can be used with a variety of dietary patterns.
This may make it a good option for people with food allergies or dietary restrictions, who may have difficulty finding other programs to accommodate their needs.
Plus, because the program does not require you to  track your calorie  or macronutrient intake, it might be a good option for those who prefer a less tedious and time consuming approach to weight loss.
During the Metabolic Reset program, members meet with their Calibrate coach every other week for additional support and guidance.
Coaches can provide personalized feedback and help you set goals as you progress through the program.
Some people might find that this can provide support and increase accountability to ensure long-term success.
Metabolic Reset is a 1-year program that introduces changes to your diet and lifestyle gradually through weekly lessons and biweekly goals.
For some people, this approach might be more manageable than making multiple changes to their daily routine all at once.
Some might also find that this can lead to more sustainable results in the long run, as behaviors and skills are strengthened, revisited, and reinforced throughout the program.

Potential downsides
Though Calibrate may offer several benefits, there are also a few downsides to consider.
Calibrate starts at $138 per month, which is significantly more expensive than some similar weight loss programs.
This does not include price of your prescription medications.
Though you might be able to use funds from your FSA or  HSA  to cover the cost of the program, this may not be an option for everyone.
The Metabolic Reset program is a 1-year program, with each level lasting about 3 months.
Based on the company’s most recent report, once members are enrolled in the program, the majority seem to complete it ( 11 ).
However, the long-term commitment, which requires ongoing payment for and administration of an injectable medication, may be too costly or uncomfortable for some.
The medications Calibrate uses are injectable, and members must self-administer them on either a daily or a weekly basis.
According to the company’s website, these injections are quick, easy, and painless. The company also states that the medications may be associated with fewer side effects than other types of medications.
However, some people may dislike the idea of injecting a medication into their skin rather than simply taking a pill or tablet.
More research is needed on the long-term effects of the GLP-1 medications Calibrate uses, especially when it comes to maintaining weight loss once the program is complete.
For instance, one study in 327 people taking semaglutide found that participants lost an average of 17.3% of body weight after 68 weeks (a little over 15.5 months) of treatment ( 16 ).
However, after discontinuing the treatment, participants regained two-thirds of prior weight loss on average over the next year ( 16 ).
Similarly, a 68-week study in 803 people found that people taking semaglutide who switched to a placebo at 20 weeks gradually regained weight they had lost. Those who continued taking the medication continued to lose weight throughout the remainder of the study ( 17 ).

Safety and side effects
The GLP-1 medications Calibrate prescribes may be associated with several side effects, including ( 8 ,  9 ):
nausea
diarrhea or constipation
vomiting
stomach pain or distension
headache
fatigue
indigestion
dizziness
belching
low blood sugar levels
gas
gastroenteritis
gastroesophageal reflux disease
Wegovy and Saxenda may also be associated with an increased risk of  pancreatitis , or inflammation of the pancreas ( 18 ,  19 ).
Furthermore, they have been shown to cause thyroid C‐cell tumors in some animal studies. Therefore, Wegovy and Saxenda are not recommended for people with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or MEN syndrome ( 18 ,  19 ).

Customer reviews and brand reputation
As of the time of publication, Calibrate is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and currently holds an F rating, which is based on factors such as the company’s complaint history and business practices ( 20 ).
Calibrate also has an average rating of 1.23 out of 5 stars on the BBB website, which is based on 26 customer reviews ( 20 ).
Some reviewers report issues with filling prescriptions, which the company states is largely due to a drug shortage that Calibrate has no control over.
A few customers also note frustration with the lack of responsiveness and communication from the company, including difficulties with receiving refunds from customer service.
On the other hand, some online reviewers say that Calibrate offers a simple and effective alternative to other options for weight management. Many report that they experienced successful weight loss after completing the program.

How it compares with other weight loss programs
Here is a closer look at how Calibrate compares with some other weight loss programs:

Is Calibrate worth it?
Calibrate may be worth considering for people who have had  difficulty losing weight  and are looking for a long-term program to help them reach their goals.
The program combines diet and lifestyle changes with the use of medications that are FDA-approved for weight management. This may be appealing to those who have tried other approaches in the past without success.
Calibrate might also be a good option for those who find other programs too restrictive, as Calibrate uses a more flexible approach and does not exclude any foods from your diet.
However, the program has a high price tag and is not suitable for everyone, including those who do not meet the eligibility criteria.
Additionally, it might not be a good fit for those who are unsure about committing to a long-term program or hesitant about self-administering daily or weekly injections.
Furthermore, additional studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of the GLP-1 medications the program uses, particularly when it comes to maintaining weight loss once the program is complete.

Frequently asked questions
Calibrate offers doctor-prescribed GLP-1, a medication that is used to treat diabetes and has been shown to reduce appetite ( 1 ).
You can cancel your Calibrate subscription at any time by emailing the company with the subject line “Cancellation Request.” However, keep in mind that you are eligible for a full refund only if you cancel before your first doctor visit.
Insurance may cover your lab work and prescription medications. You can also use funds from your FSA or HSA to cover the Metabolic Reset program if you decide to pay the full amount up front.

The bottom line
Calibrate is a yearlong program that combines diet and lifestyle changes with prescription medications to support weight loss.
The program also provides regular support from a health coach and uses a more flexible, less restrictive approach to dieting than some other programs, which some people may prefer.
On the other hand, it requires a long-term commitment, can be quite expensive, and may not be suitable for everyone, including those who do not meet the eligibility criteria for the program.
Before signing up for Calibrate, it’s a good idea to consult a doctor, a registered dietitian, or another trusted healthcare professional to find out whether it’s the right fit for you.
