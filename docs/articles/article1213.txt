Stasher offers a full line of reusable silicone bags in a wide range of sizes and colors, from snack-sized baggies to half-gallon (2-L) bags. They also offer stand-up and lay-flat options to suit a variety of needs.
In addition, the bags are  BPA-free  and can even be used for cooking. They’re safe for use in the microwave, boiling water, and oven — just keep the temperature below 425°F (218°C).
Many customers also appreciate that the bags are dishwasher safe.
If you’re committed to using more reusable bags, the Stasher Starter Kit is a great option, as it includes five lay-flat bags of various sizes and two stand-up bags.

For  bulk food storage  — like flour, cereal, coffee beans, oats, pasta, or more — these bags from (re)zip are a solid choice.
In addition to a leakproof double zipper seal, they also feature a stand-up base, so they may be easier to spot in your pantry.
The bags are BPA-free and made from a food-safe vinyl known as polyethylene vinyl acetate (PEVA).
While PEVA is dishwasher and freezer safe, it’s not as heat resistant as silicone. As a result, these bags shouldn’t be used for cooking or reheating leftovers in the microwave.
Reviewers also note that the mouth of each bag is on the small side, so it can be difficult to get larger items in the container.
The company also offers a full line of reusable bags in addition to these large standing ones.

If you frequently find yourself freezing leftovers, sauces, or stocks, then you may want to invest in a set of reusable freezer-safe storage bags.
These extra-thick bags from Skque are made from extra-thick, food-grade PEVA, which helps protect your food from  freezer burn .
Just keep in mind that while they’re freezer safe, these bags can’t be heated. As a result, you’ll want to keep them out of the microwave and dishwasher.
Still, customers note that the bags are easy to hand-wash using cold or warm water.
Skque’s flat or standing bags come in 12-piece starter kits, each of which contains 4 small, 4 medium, and 4 large bags.
As with many of the brands mentioned above, Zip Top offers a full line of reusable bags. However, the brand stands out for including products that are specifically designed for infants, kids, and parents.
Price:  $$
These lidless containers from Zip Top are a good option for on-the-go  snacks for toddlers and kids .
In addition to being small enough for young children to hold, the containers are dishwasher safe, made of BPA-free silicone, and fit neatly into cupholders.
They also have a zipper seal, so you don’t have to worry about misplacing a lid.
As a bonus, the containers come in kid-friendly shapes and colors, including a blue bear, an orange cat, a brown dog, and a pink pig.
Price:  $$
As with Zip Top’s other products, these  breast milk storage  bags are BPA-free, made from pure silicone, and dishwasher and freezer-safe.
Each bag is designed to hold up to 6 ounces (177 mL) of breast milk and can be labeled using a dry erase marker so you know how long the milk is good for.
Plus, as these bags are made of a single piece of nontoxic silicone, they’re easier to keep clean.
However, some reviewers report that these bags are more prone to leaks than single-use breast milk storage bags. So, we recommend buying the six-piece set, as it includes a storage tray for keeping the bags upright.

Unlike the other products on this list, which are better suited for leftovers and sandwiches, Earthwise Reusable Mesh Produce Bags are designed to replace single-use plastic produce bags from the grocery store.
In addition to bringing these breathable mesh bags to the supermarket with you, they can even be used to  store your produce  in or out of the fridge.
The bags are made from BPA-free polyester mesh and weigh less than a third of an ounce (approximately 9 grams) each. So, they won’t add a significant amount of weight to your shopping basket.
They’re also transparent, making it possible to scan items without taking them out of the bag. Plus, the mesh design allows for moisture to escape when  washing your produce .
The bags measure 11 inches by 14 inches (28 cm by 36 cm) and are sold in sets of 9.

Reusable wraps serve a similar purpose as reusable storage bags, though there’s an important exception: They’re not leakproof or appropriate for cooking. Instead, they’re a great substitute for plastic wrap.
Bee’s Wrap is one of the best reusable food wraps, as it’s made from just four ingredients, including organic cotton, beeswax, jojoba oil, and tree resin.
The wrap comes in three sizes and is great for  storing leftovers , cut produce, and bread.
When placed in the fridge, the wrap stiffens slightly in the shape that you place it in, making it a good option for covering storage containers as well.
If you’re just getting started, the Bee’s Wrap 3-Pack is a great option, though the company also makes bread wraps, sandwich wraps, and large rolls, which can be cut to the size you need.
Price:  $
Food Huggers are silicone lids that come in a variety of sizes, making them a convenient way to store cut produce, along with cans, jars, and small bowls that don’t have lids.
Plus, because they’re made from silicone, they’re flexible and dishwasher safe.
To accommodate a variety of storage needs, we recommend buying the Food Huggers Complete Set, which includes five sizes of lids.
You can also purchase Food Huggers that are specially made for  avocados , larger bowls, and butter.

How to choose
Wondering how to choose the best reusable food storage solution for you? The biggest factor to consider is what you’ll be using it for.
For example, if you want a food storage bag that can “do it all” — meaning that it can be used in the freezer, microwave, and dishwasher — then you’ll want to choose bags or wraps that are made from pure silicone.
On the other hand, products made from PEVA are generally good for the freezer but are not heat-resistant.
Additionally, if you’re primarily looking for a way to store odds and ends, like cut produce, slices of bread, or open cans, you may want to consider a reusable wrap.
In fact, you may find that you need a combination of bags and wraps to cover all the bases.
Finally, you’ll also want to consider your budget. As a general rule, PEVA is less expensive, while products made from pure silicone are pricier.

The bottom line
Replacing single-use plastic bags with reusable options is just one of  many ways to reduce your carbon footprint .
While some are heat resistant and dishwasher safe, others are thicker and better for freezer storage.
Reusable bags and wraps also come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and colors, making it possible to find an option that best fits your needs and preferences.
By considering your storage needs and using this list as a guide, we’re confident that you’ll find the reusable food storage bag or wrap that’s right for you.
