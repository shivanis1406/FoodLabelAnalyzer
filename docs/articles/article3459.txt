Title: What to Know About Apple Cider Vinegar Pills

While apple cider vinegar in liquid form may have health benefits, little research exists on these effects in pill form. These pills contain a powder form of the vinegar in varying amounts, sometimes along with other ingredients.
Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is very popular in natural health and wellness. It’s made by fermenting apples with yeast and bacteria.
Many claim it can help lose weight or lower cholesterol and blood sugar levels. To reap these benefits without having to consume liquid vinegar, especially if you don’t like its strong taste or smell, you may turn to apple cider vinegar pills, which contain a dehydrated form of the vinegar.
This article takes a detailed look at the possible benefits and downsides of apple cider vinegar pills.

What does taking apple cider vinegar pills do?
There is little research on the effects of ACV pills. The supposed benefits are based on studies that examined liquid  ACV  or acetic acid, its main active compound.
These benefits may include:
helping  with weight loss
helping  kill  harmful bacteria
helping  lower  blood sugar
supporting lower blood cholesterol

Do apple cider vinegar pills work the same as drinking them?
While available research is helpful in predicting the possible effects of liquid apple cider vinegar, it’s difficult to assess if the pill form has the same effect.
One  2020 study  compared the effect of vinegar, in general, to vinegar capsules on blood sugar. The researchers found that the tablets may not be as effective as the liquid form in this area.
Most research on the effects of ACV capsules on humans is needed.

What are the side effects of apple cider vinegar pills?
ACV capsules  are unlikely to be harmful  as long as you stick  to the  recommended dose.
That said, consuming apple cider vinegar generally can  have  negative side effects . These may include  erosion  of tooth enamel and  throat or skin burns .
But, these effects most likely occur because of the vinegar’s acidity, which may be less of a factor if you consume it in capsule form rather than liquid form.
Other possible side effects if you take it in large  amounts  include  low potassium. Possible interactions with medications such as diabetes and diuretic drugs are also possible . More research is needed to understand whether these also apply to the capsule form.

How many apple cider vinegar pills can you take?
Due to the minimal research on apple cider vinegar pills, there is no suggested or standard dosage.
The research that currently exists suggests that around  15 ml per day  of liquid apple cider vinegar diluted in water appears to be safe and have health benefits.
Compared to that, the amount of ACV in pills varies by brand. But, typically, one capsule contains about  500 milligrams (mg) , which is equivalent to two liquid teaspoons (tsp) or 10 milliliters (ml).
Most brands of apple cider vinegar pills recommend similar amounts, though few state an equivalent in liquid form, and it’s difficult to verify this information.

How do I choose apple cider vinegar pills?
While the recommended dosages of apple cider vinegar pills may be similar to those that appear to be safe and effective in liquid form, it’s unknown if the pills have the same properties as the liquid.
Some brands also include other ingredients that may not be listed. What’s more, the reported amount of apple cider vinegar in pills may not even be accurate since the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t regulate supplements.
In fact, one  older study  analyzed eight different apple cider vinegar pills and found that their labels and reported ingredients were both inconsistent and inaccurate.
If you’re looking to try apple cider vinegar pills, keep possible risks in mind. You can buy them over the counter or online
It’s best to look for brands that have been tested by a third party and include a logo from NSF International, NSF Certified for Sport, United States Pharmacopeia (USP), Informed-Choice, ConsumerLab or the Banned Substances Control Group (BSCG).
Consuming apple cider vinegar in liquid form diluted with water may be the best way to know exactly what you are ingesting.

The Bottom Line
Apple cider vinegar in liquid form may aid weight loss, blood sugar control and high cholesterol levels.
People who don’t like the strong smell or taste of vinegar may be interested in apple cider vinegar pills.
It’s unclear whether apple cider vinegar pills have the same health benefits as the liquid form or if they’re safe in similar dosages.
These supplements are not regulated by the FDA and may contain varying amounts of apple cider vinegar or unknown ingredients, making it difficult to assess their safety.
If you’re looking to reap the  possible benefits  of apple cider vinegar, consuming the liquid form may be your best bet. You can do this by diluting it with water to drink, adding it to salad dressings, or mixing it into soups.
