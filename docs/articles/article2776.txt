Mindbodygreen probiotics+ contains Bifidobacterium lactis B420, a probiotic strain that is a trademark of the chemical and technological innovation company DuPont.
This strain has been studied specifically for its use in  weight management , though research is limited.
A  2016 study  found that taking 10 billion CFU of Bifidobacterium lactis B420 daily helped regulate body fat mass, reduce waist circumference, and reduce food intake over 6 months.
However, it’s important to note that the study was funded by DuPont.
Mindbodygreen probiotics+ also contains Bifidobacterium lactis HN019. A  2016 study  found that people who took this strain for 45 days lost significantly more weight than those who did not.
This probiotic is gluten-free, vegan, and shelf-stable. Additionally, mindbodygreen states that the product has been third-party tested for purity and potency, though the name of the testing organization isn’t disclosed.

Bariatric Advantage is a shelf-stable supplement that also uses the trademarked probiotic strain Bifidobacterium lactis B420, which has been specifically studied for use in managing  weight  and reducing  body fat mass  and reducing  waist circumference .
While it doesn’t need to be refrigerated, FloraVantage Control does need to be stored below 75°F (24°C). As such, it’s important to purchase the product from a reputable retailer to ensure that it is stored and shipped at a proper temperature.
Bariatric Advantage supplements are manufactured in CGMP compliant facilities. However, products are not third-party tested to confirm purity and potency.
This product also comes at a lower cost than mindbodygreen probiotics+.

Strains:  Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL-60 & CUL-21, Lactobacillus plantarum CUL-66, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CUL-34, Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL-20
Certifications:  NSF certified facilities
The probiotic strains used in Genestra Brands HMF Metabolic were clinically tested in a study funded by Cultech Limited, a supplement ingredient manufacturer.
A  2020 study  found that people with overweight or obesity who took probiotic supplements with 50 billion CFU of a mix of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60 and CUL21, Lactobacillus plantarum CUL66, Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CUL34 had lower weight,  lower body mass index , and smaller waist circumferences after 6 months than people who took a placebo.
The effects were more pronounced in women and people with obesity.
However, it’s important to note that those who took the probiotics only experienced 1.5% weight loss, while  5%  or more is what’s considered clinically meaningful to reduce risk factors for disease.
Unlike the other two supplements above, Genestra Brands HMF Metabolic is vegan-friendly, though it does require refrigeration.

Strains:  Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG 10 billion CFU, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. Lactis CECT 8145 2 billion CFU
Culturelle Metabolism + Weight Management Capsules is the most affordable option on our list.
The supplement contains Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. Lactis CECT 8145, a strain that  one study  found to be effective for reducing waist circumference in adults with obesity after 3 months.
Keep in mind that in the study above, people were given a probiotic supplement with 10 billion CFU, which is more than the 2 billion found in Culturelle Metabolism + Weight Management. Therefore, it’s unknown whether this supplement contains an effective dose.
While Culturelle products are not routinely tested for purity and potency by a third-party lab, the company states that it takes multiple measures to ensure quality and safety.

RenewLife Healthy Weight 2-in-1 Prebiotics + Probiotics contain Lactobacillus gasseri BNR17 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus, two probiotic strains that have been studied for their use in weight management.
A  2018 study  found that adults with overweight or obesity who took 10 billion CFU of L. gasseri BNR17 daily for 12 weeks experienced significant  visceral fat  loss and reduced waist circumference compared with those who did not.
Another study  found that women with obesity who took L. rhamnosus CGMCC1.3724, along with making dietary changes, experienced significant weight and fat loss after 12 weeks. These changes were sustained at 24 weeks. Interestingly, the probiotic did not have a significant effect in men.
It’s important to note that while RenewLife Healthy Weight 2-in-1 Prebiotics + Probiotics contain L. rhamnosus, it does not specify whether it’s the CGMCC strain.
Renew Life Healthy Weight 2-in-1 Prebiotics + Probiotics is dairy-free, but it’s not certified as vegan. Additionally, you’ll need to keep it stored in the refrigerator because it isn’t shelf-stable.

A comparison of the best probiotics for weight loss
Here’s a quick look at how our top picks compare:
* Third-party testing refers to whether products are tested to confirm purity and potency by an independent lab.

Can probiotic supplements help you lose weight?
Only a few probiotic strains have been clinically tested for  effectiveness in weight loss  and management:
B. animalis ssp. lactis 420
B. animalis subsp. lactis CECT 8145
L. rhamnosus CGMCC1.3724
L. gasseri BNR 17
a multi-strain blend of L. acidophilus CUL60, L. acidophilus CUL21, L. plantarum CUL66, B. bifidum CUL20, and B. animalis subsp. lactis CUL34
The methods by which these probiotic strains affect body weight aren’t well understood, but it’s thought that they may reduce  inflammation  by regulating the gut microbiome, reduce  appetite-regulating hormones , or decrease  fat storage .
When shopping for probiotics to assist in your weight loss efforts, it’s important to look for one of the above strains.
Also keep in mind that while they may be appropriate for general  gut health  support, most broad-spectrum probiotics don’t contain the exact strains that have been shown to be effective for weight loss.
For example, a probiotic supplement may list Lactobacillus rhamnosus on the ingredient list. However, there are many types of L. rhamnosus, and only L. rhamnosus CGMCC1.3724 has been shown to be effective for weight loss.
By looking at the label, it’s impossible to know whether the product in question contains the correct strain for weight loss.

How to choose a probiotic
When shopping for a probiotic to support your weight loss efforts, it’s important to consider several factors, including your dietary needs and the product’s probiotic strains, CFU count, storage requirements, third-party testing, and cost.
Make sure to choose a product that contains a probiotic strain that has been shown to be effective for weight management.
The  Clinical Guide to Probiotic Products  is a handy reference that lists brand names of clinically tested probiotic strains and their proposed uses.
In addition to containing an evidence-based strain, probiotics for weight loss should contain an effective dose of that strain.
For example, Bifidobacterium lactis B-420 has been shown to be effective at a dose of 10 billion CFU per day.
Additionally, weight loss studies using a mix of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL-60, Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL-21, Lactobacillus plantarum CUL-66, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CUL-34, and Bifidobacterum bifidum CUL-20 were effective at 50 billion CFU per day.
Look for a product that has  100 million–1 billion CFU , which is the minimum effective daily dose for probiotics.
Probiotics  may be shelf-stable (stored at room temperature), or they may require refrigeration.
If you travel often for work or don’t always have access to a refrigerator, it’s best to go with a shelf-stable product.
Because the FDA does not regulate supplements in the same way as pharmaceuticals, the best way to ensure the safety, purity, and potency of a probiotic supplement is to purchase a product that’s third-party tested by a credible organization.
Some examples of third-party organizations to look for are:
NSF International
USP
UL Solutions
If so, look for products that meet your specific dietary needs, such as vegan, vegetarian, dairy-free, soy-free, or gluten-free.
Probiotics can vary in price, so compare brands and buy based on what you can afford.

Potential side effects of probiotics
Probiotics are  generally considered safe  for healthy adults. However, using an inappropriate strain can upset the balance of your gut microbiome and may cause gastrointestinal side effects such as  gas  and  bloating .
In some cases, probiotics may be harmful, such as for those with  suppressed immune systems .
The  medical literature  also cautions against probiotics for people who:
have autoimmune conditions
have heart conditions
have been diagnosed with HIV
take immune-suppressing drugs
are undergoing chemotherapy or radiation
are pregnant or nursing
have recently had surgery
As with any supplement, it’s important to consult a healthcare professional before adding a probiotic to your wellness routine.

Frequently asked questions
Probiotic supplements  are usually taken once or twice per day or as directed by a healthcare professional. Supplements can be taken at any time of the day, but the best time is  after a meal .
This is because food helps neutralize the acidic environment of your stomach, allowing the probiotic bacteria to survive in your digestive tract.
Just keep in mind that probiotics and antibiotics should be spaced at least  2 hours  apart.

The bottom line
Overall, research on probiotics for weight loss is limited.
However, some studies have found certain strains — including B. animalis ssp. lactis 420 and CECT 8145, L. rhamnosus CGMCC1.3724, L. gasseri BNR17, L. acidophilus CUL-60 and CUL-21, L. plantarum CUL-66, B. animalis subsp. lactis CUL-34, and B. bifidum CUL-20 — to be effective for  weight loss  and appetite regulation.
While it’s important to choose a product containing probiotic strains that have been shown to be effective for weight loss, keep in mind that probiotic supplements are just one tool to assist in your weight loss efforts.
To reach and maintain your weight loss goal, you’ll still need to focus on other healthy habits, including  eating a balanced diet , engaging in regular exercise, and getting enough sleep.
