Title: Milk Thistle Tea: Benefits, Side Effects, and Dosage

Milk thistle tea is made from an herb with milky, white-veined leaves. It has many reported benefits, including liver protection and diabetes management. However, few studies back these claims.
This article provides a detailed overview of milk thistle tea, its compounds, possible benefits and downsides, and how to make it.

What is milk thistle?
The milk thistle plant (Silybum marianum) is part of the Asteraceae family and is native to the Mediterranean. Its name comes from the milky white veins on the leaves and the white sap they produce when broken. The plant’s flowers are purple.
Milk thistle is also known as Saint Mary’s Thistle, holy thistle, variegated thistle, and Scotch thistle.
Throughout history, milk thistle has also been used to treat  liver and gallbladder issues . Research has also explored its potential to protect against neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, diabetes, and heart disease.
Milk thistle is available as capsules, tablets, liquid extracts, and tea. The plant’s seeds and sometimes leaves are used in these preparations.
Milk thistle tea has a mild taste comparable to that of dandelion tea.

Beneficial compounds
The main active compound in milk thistle is silymarin, and silybin is the main component of this group.
Though silymarin is present in the flowers and leaves of the thistle, it’s most concentrated in the seeds.
The purported health benefits of milk thistle are thought to be connected to silymarin’s antioxidant properties.
Silymarin may exhibit antioxidant effects by scavenging and preventing the formation of reactive molecules called free radicals that can contribute to  cell damage  and disease development. It may also decrease inflammatory responses in your body.
Since milk thistle teas are often made with ground or whole seeds, they provide some silymarin, but they’re not as concentrated as extracts.
What’s more, milk thistle is poorly absorbed and  not water-soluble . Thus, drinking this tea is not the best way to absorb any beneficial plant compounds.

Possible benefits
Existing studies on milk thistle have been small, poorly designed, or have produced mixed results. What’s more, the limited research has focused on extracts and pills, both of which are more concentrated than tea.
As such, any promising effects of  milk thistle preparations  noted in existing studies may not apply to diluted milk thistle tea, especially when considering the plant’s low water solubility and poor absorption.
Keep this in mind when reviewing the following possible benefits of milk thistle.
The most studied benefit of milk thistle is its potential to promote liver health. Some studies suggest the plant may help with management and treatment of:
viral hepatitis
alcohol-related liver disease
non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease
liver injuries caused by drugs or toxins
While it remains unclear how milk thistle may affect your liver,  some researchers posit  that silymarin extracted from the plant may have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiviral effects.
For example,  one 2014 review  found that silymarin may extend the life expectancy of people with cirrhosis due to alcohol-related liver disease, possibly by protecting the liver from free radicals produced during alcohol metabolism.
Ultimately, more research is needed to better understand the effectiveness and safety of milk thistle preparations, including teas, in treating liver diseases.
Milk thistle is also being investigated for its potential anti-diabetic effects.
A 2016 review  found that silymarin supplements significantly reduced fasting  blood sugar levels  in people with diabetes. However, the reviewers noted that the available studies were of low quality and that more research is needed.
Milk thistle may help with blood sugar management by improving insulin sensitivity and decreasing inflammation associated with diabetes.
Even though the results from existing research are promising, larger, well-designed studies are needed to investigate the use of these extracts and teas in diabetes management.
Early research  suggests that silymarin extract may have anti-cancer effects, potentially reducing the rate of cell reproduction and division. However, many studies have only observed these anti-cancer effects in test tube models rather than in human tests. As a result, further research is necessary to explore the potential role of silymarin extract as an adjunctive in cancer treatment.

Dosage and side effects
There is no standardized dosage or recommended intake for milk thistle tea, but it’s generally considered safe if consumed in moderation.
Milk Thistle medications are commonly available in strengths ranging of  250 to 750 mg  and intended for taking 2 to 3 times per day.
Due to a lack of research on milk thistle tea use in people who are pregnant or chestfeeding, you should speak with a healthcare professional before trying it if you’re in either of those groups.
People with breast, uterine, or ovarian cancers, endometriosis, or fibroids should avoid milk thistle.
Milk thistle interacts with certain medications, including warfarin, indinavir, or saquinavir for HIV infections, chemotherapy, calcium channel blockers (for hypertension and arrhythmia), and some antibiotics. People taking these medications should also avoid using milk thistle.
Finally, if you have allergies to plants in the same family, such as  ragweed , chrysanthemum, marigold, and daisy, you may be at risk of allergic reactions and should proceed with caution, according to the  National Centre for Complementary and Integrative Health .

The bottom line
Milk thistle tea is an herbal drink touted to promote liver health, stimulate breast milk production, and protect against  diabetes .
However, there have been no studies on milk thistle tea specifically, and research on other preparations — such as isolated forms of the active compound silymarin — is limited. Milk thistle may also be poorly absorbed in tea form.
If you still want to explore the possible benefits of milk thistle tea, it’s easy to make at home. Just keep in mind that more research is needed to understand its effectiveness and safety.
