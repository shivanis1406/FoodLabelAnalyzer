Title: Oil Pulling With Coconut Oil Can Transform Your Dental Health

Oil pulling may reduce the harmful bacteria in your mouth and decrease your risk of some health conditions. But no evidence suggests it draws toxins from the blood or whitens your teeth.
Oil pulling is an ancient Indian folk remedy claimed to whiten your teeth, freshen your breath, and greatly improve your oral health.
Using coconut oil for oil pulling is becoming increasingly popular.
Many people swear by this remedy, and many say it also improves their health in other ways.
This article explores whether there is any truth behind these claims or whether oil pulling is just another ineffective trend.

What is oil pulling, and how does it work?
Oil pulling involves swishing oil around the mouth like a mouthwash. It has been used for thousands of years as an Indian folk remedy.
The main benefit of oil pulling is that it reduces the amount of harmful bacteria in the mouth.
There are hundreds of different types of bacteria in your mouth. While many are friendly, others are not. The bacteria in your mouth create a biofilm on your teeth, a thin layer known as  plaque .
Having some plaque on your teeth is perfectly normal, but if it gets out of hand, it can cause various problems, including:
bad breath
gum inflammation like  gingivitis
cavities
gum disease
The way oil pulling works is simple — when you swish the oil around your mouth, the bacteria get swept away and dissolve in the liquid oil.
Oil pulling should work with almost any oil, but extra-virgin  coconut oil  is a popular choice due to its pleasant taste.
It also has a favorable fatty acid profile, containing  high amounts  of  lauric acid , which has antimicrobial properties.

Oil pulling is an ancient Indian remedy to clean the mouth and teeth. It is claimed to reduce the risk of cavities, gum inflammation, and bad breath.

Coconut oil pulling can reduce harmful bacteria in your mouth
Streptococcus mutans is one of the main bacteria in your mouth and a key player in plaque buildup and tooth decay.
One  2016 study  in 60 adults showed that oil pulling with coconut oil for 10 minutes daily significantly reduced the number of S. mutans in saliva in as little as 2 weeks, compared to distilled water.
An  older study  in children concluded that coconut oil was as effective as a standard  chlorhexidine mouthwash  at reducing S. mutans.
While these results are promising, more studies are needed comparing the effectiveness of coconut oil to other types of oils.
Using coconut oil as a mouthwash can significantly reduce the number of harmful bacteria, such as S. mutans, in your mouth.

Oil pulling can reduce plaque and gingivitis
Gingivitis  is caused by inflammation of the gums and occurs when your immune system starts attacking the bacteria in the plaque.
A  2020 study  of 20 adults determined that virgin  coconut oil  was effective at reducing the accumulation of plaque when used in oil pulling. The authors note that more research is still needed.
One  2017 study  involving 40 dental students compared the effects of coconut oil pulling and a placebo. Researchers found oil pulling effective at reducing plaque.
Oil pulling with coconut oil may help reduce inflammation of the gums, also known as gingivitis.

Oil pulling can reduce bad breath
Bad breath , otherwise known as halitosis,  often occurs  because of the smell of chemicals and gases produced by bacteria in your mouth.
People with halitosis typically have an underlying cause, which can include:
overall poor oral hygiene
gingivitis
cavities
infections
some digestive conditions
It makes sense that if you get rid of some of these bacteria and improve your oral health, you reduce the likelihood of having bad breath.
More studies need to examine whether oil pulling with coconut oil has similar benefits for halitosis. But given that it  may reduce  plaque and gingivitis, it seems likely.
Oil pulling may reduce bad breath.

Unproven benefits and misconceptions
One common claim is that oil pulling can  whiten your teeth . Currently,  no studies  confirm this benefit.
Some people also believe that oil pulling is a type of  detox  that draws toxins from the blood. No evidence supports this idea.
Finally, there is no scientific evidence that this remedy helps treat diseases other than those affecting the mouth.
Currently, no evidence supports claims that oil pulling whitens your teeth or eliminates toxins in your blood.

How to oil pull
To try oil pulling:
Put about 1 tbsp (15 mL) of oil in your mouth
Swish the oil around your mouth for about 15–20 minutes
Spit out the oil, then brush your teeth
It’s best to spit the oil onto a piece of paper and put it in the trash, as it might otherwise clog your pipes over time.
There is no need to use a lot of force. If oil pulling causes pain in your facial muscles, relax a bit. Try using less oil next time, and don’t swish it around too forcefully.
Some people say it’s best to oil pull on an empty stomach before brushing your teeth. Many do it while showering or bathing in the morning.
Oil pulling is simple. Put 1 tbsp (15 mL) of oil in your mouth, swish it around for 15–20 minutes and spit it out. Then rinse with water and brush your teeth.
