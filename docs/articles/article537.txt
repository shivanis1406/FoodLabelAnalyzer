Title: 18 Healthier Options at Taco Bell

If you’re trying to eat healthier or follow a specific eating plan, fast food can quickly throw a wrench in your plans.
Most fast food is loaded with calories, fat, and refined carbs yet short on fruits and vegetables — unless you order a salad.
Fortunately, the food chain Taco Bell offers several options that suit  low calorie , vegetarian, vegan, low carb, keto, or high protein diets.
Here are 18 healthier menu options at Taco Bell, along with ways to make your order a little more nutritious.

Choose two or three of the highest-protein options and request extra lettuce or tomatoes to make this a larger, more complete meal.

Note that while these options are high in protein, they’re also high in calories, fat, refined carbs, and sodium. Ask to receive them fresca-style to reduce the calories and fat content without significantly reducing the protein content.
Each of these menu options contains at least 20 grams of protein per serving with no modifications.

Ordering healthier at Taco Bell
Here are some ways that you can make the menu items at Taco Bell more nutritious:
Ask for extra meat or beans.  This increases the calorie content but also the amount of protein, which makes the meal more filling ( 6 ,  7 ).
Ask for fresca-style.  This replaces the cheese, sour cream, and mayo-based sauces with diced tomatoes, reducing menu items by a few hundred calories each.
Ask for guacamole.  The  avocado  used to make guacamole adds calories but is also an excellent source of healthy plant-based fats ( 8 ).
Choose a zero-calorie drink.  Most soft drinks are loaded with sugar and calories that can contribute to excess weight gain, so choose water, unsweetened tea, or soda instead ( 9 ).
Pass on the sweets.  Taco Bell offers frozen slushies and dessert items, but these get most of their calories from sugar, so it’s best to avoid them ( 10 ).
Use the online calculator.  Taco Bell’s website features a nutrition calculator that lets you plan and customize your meal to view the nutrition information. This can be helpful when planning a fast food meal to suit your eating plan or preferences ( 5 ).
Note that like most fast food, Taco Bell meals may not be suitable if you’re on a sodium-restricted diet. Nearly all the meats, beans, sauces, tortillas, and shells are pre-made or pre-seasoned with large quantities of salt ( 11 ).
Plus, if you’re looking to stay away from food additives or highly processed foods, consider avoiding this food chain. Except for the fresh vegetables, most Taco Bell ingredients are highly processed and contain food additives.
This is worth considering. Emerging research suggests that highly processed foods may contribute to obesity and the development of chronic health condition like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer ( 12 ,  13 ,  14 ).
Highly processed foods are typically also hyperpalatable, meaning that they’re designed to taste extremely good. This makes it easy to keep eating even after you’re full, and it may increase your future cravings for highly processed foods ( 15 ,  16 ,  17 ).

The bottom line
Most  fast food  is loaded with calories, fat, and refined carbs. Taco Bell is no exception, though this food chain also offers low calorie, high protein, and vegetarian options — and with a few modifications, you can even find a keto meal.
If you’re limiting sodium or avoiding highly processed foods, Taco Bell may not be a good choice for you.
To make your Taco Bell meals as nutritious as possible, ask for your meal fresca-style with extra meat or beans, opt for sugar-free drinks, and skip the desserts.
