Title: Is Squash a Fruit or Vegetable?

Squashes are considered to be fruits because they contain seeds and develop from the flower-producing part of a plant. However, because they’re more savory than sweet, most people cook and prepare them like they’re vegetables.
Squash is a family of plants that comes in several different types.
Winter varieties include butternut, acorn, delicata, pumpkin, hubbard, kabocha and spaghetti squashes. Zucchini and yellow squash — either with straight or crooked necks — are considered summer squashes.
However, squash may be confusing to classify.
Most kinds of squash are brightly colored — like fruit — but taste mild or savory — like vegetables.
This article tells you whether squash is a fruit or a vegetable.

Botanically, It’s a Fruit
Fruits contain seeds and develop from the flowers of a plant. On the other hand, vegetables are a plant’s roots, stems or leaves.
Not everyone agrees with these botanical definitions, but they’re used widely to distinguish between fruits and vegetables ( 1 ).
All types of squash have seeds and come from the flowering part of plants. In fact, edible flowers even grow out of squash and are known as squash blossoms.
Therefore, squash is considered a fruit.
Squash isn’t the only plant that gets confused for a vegetable. Other fruits frequently called veggies include  tomatoes , eggplants,  avocados  and  cucumbers  ( 2 ).
Since squash contains seeds and develops from the flower-producing part of a plant, it is botanically a fruit.

Used as a Vegetable in Cooking
Most people think of squash as a vegetable because it is usually prepared like one.
The culinary definition of a  fruit  is the sweet and fleshy part of a plant. While some types of squash are mildly sweet, they’re not as sweet as a typical fruit ( 3 ).
Instead, squash have a predominantly earthy flavor and are prepared and served as a vegetable — except when some types, like pumpkin, are used in desserts, such as pie.
Squash is not usually  eaten raw  as is fruit, though zucchini and yellow summer squash can be.
It is often seen as a savory ingredient and cooked alongside other vegetables.
Even though squash is botanically a fruit, it is predominantly cooked like a vegetable.

How to Add It to Your Diet
Squash can be eaten in a multitude of ways. The entire squash plant is edible, including the flesh, skin, leaves, flowers and  seeds .
You can find squash year-round in most grocery stores and farmers markets.
Winter squashes — such as butternut, acorn, hubbard, delicata, and pumpkin — are abundant from early fall through late spring. They have green, yellow or orange skin and brightly colored flesh in different shades of yellow and orange.
Summer squash, including zucchini and crookneck, are typically in season from June through September. These varieties have yellow or green skin with white flesh.
Winter squash is often roasted, boiled or steamed. It is usually served with butter or  olive oil  and savory seasonings.
You can also add cooked winter squash to salads and soups. Alternatively, try stuffing acorn, delicata or hubbard squashes with meats, beans or other vegetables. The seeds of winter squash can be roasted with oil and salt for a crunchy snack.
Zucchini and yellow crookneck squash are usually sauteed, roasted or grilled with olive oil and  garlic , or added to sweet breads and muffins. As they can be spiralized, they have also become a popular  low-carb substitute for noodles .
All types of squash are very nutritious and can be a healthy addition to your diet. Winter squashes are typically high in fiber, vitamin A and potassium, while summer squashes are rich in B vitamins and vitamin C ( 4 ,  5 ).
Squash is available year-round in most places. Winter squash is often served stuffed with other foods or as an addition to soups and vegetable dishes, whereas summer squash is popular in baked goods and as a low-carb noodle alternative.

The Bottom Line
Botanically speaking, all types of squash are fruits, as they contain seeds and develop from the flower-producing part of a plant.
However — despite notable exceptions, such as  pumpkin  — squashes are not as sweet as other fruits and are usually prepared and served as you would vegetables.
Regardless of how you classify it, squash can be a tasty and nutritious addition to your diet.
