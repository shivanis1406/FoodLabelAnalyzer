Title: 8 Impressive Health Benefits of Gooseberries

Gooseberries are nutritious, low-calorie fruits that are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. These berries may have health benefits that include lower blood sugar, cholesterol and blood pressure.
Gooseberries are small, nutritious fruits that offer many health benefits.
The European and American varieties —  Ribes uva-crispa  and  Ribes hirtellum,  respectively — are the most common types. Both are closely related to black, red, and white currants ( 1 ).
The fruits of the gooseberry bush are small, weighing around 0.1–0.2 ounces (3–6 grams) each. They vary in color and can be green, yellow-white, pink, red, or dark purple. Their flavor ranges from tart to sweet ( 1 ).
Here are 8 reasons why gooseberries are a great addition to a healthy diet.

1. Highly nutritious
Gooseberries are low in calories and fat, yet packed with nutrients.
Just 1 cup (150 grams) of gooseberries contains ( 2 ,  3 ):
Calories:  66
Protein:  1 gram
Fat:  less than 1  gram
Carbs:  15 grams
Fiber:  7 grams
Vitamin C:  46% of the  Daily Value (DV)
Vitamin B5:  9% of the DV
Vitamin B6:  7% of the DV
Copper:  12% of the DV
Manganese:  9% of the DV
Potassium:  6% of the DV
Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant and vital to your nervous system,  immune system , and skin. Vitamin B5 is necessary for creating fatty acids, while vitamin B6, which many enzymes and cells in your body need to function, helps convert food into energy ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
Copper  is important for your heart, blood vessels, immune system, and brain. Meanwhile, manganese supports metabolism, bone formation, reproduction, and immune response, whereas potassium is essential for normal cell function ( 8 ,  9 ,  10 ).
Summary  Gooseberries are low in  calories and fat but rich in dietary fiber, copper, manganese, potassium, and  vitamins C, B5, and B6.

2. High in fiber and low in calories
Gooseberries are  high in fiber  yet low in energy, meaning you can eat a decent portion without consuming too many calories.
In fact, eating 1 cup (150 grams) of gooseberries contributes just over 3% of the average person’s total daily calorie needs, making them a nutritious, low-calorie snack ( 2 ).
In addition, research shows that eating berries may  aid weight loss  and help you eat fewer calories overall ( 11 ,  12 ).
For example, one small study found that those who ate berries as a snack consumed 130 fewer calories at their next meal, compared with those who ate the same number of calories from sweets ( 11 ).
Furthermore, gooseberries are a great source of soluble and insoluble dietary fiber.
One cup (150 grams) of gooseberries provides 26% of the DV of fiber, making it a great way to boost your intake ( 2 ,  3 ).
Insoluble fiber helps add bulk to your stool and improves consistency, whereas  soluble fiber  helps slow the movement of food in your gut, which can reduce hunger and increase feelings of fullness ( 13 ,  14 ).
Additionally, dietary fiber from fruit can help control your blood sugar levels and reduce blood pressure, cholesterol, and your risk of chronic conditions, including certain cancers, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity ( 13 ,  15 ,  16 ).
Summary  Gooseberries are low in calories and high in  fiber, which helps protect against obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and  some types of cancer.

3. Rich in antioxidants
Antioxidants are compounds that help fight the effects of free radicals. These are reactive molecules that cause cellular damage and lead to a process known as oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is associated with many diseases and premature aging ( 4 ,  17 ).
Diets  rich in antioxidants  are thought to reduce your risk of certain types of cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, aging, and protect your brain from degenerative disease ( 4 ,  18 ,  19 ,  20 ,  21 ).
Gooseberries are an excellent source of antioxidants, including vitamin C, small amounts of vitamin E, and phytonutrients ( 22 ,  23 ).
Plants produce phytonutrients to keep healthy and protect against sun damage and insects.
Some of the phytonutrients in gooseberries include ( 1 ,  4 ,  24 ,  25 ):
Flavonols.  These are linked  to heart health and may have stroke-reducing, cancer-fighting, and  antiviral effects. The main types in gooseberries are quercetin,  myricetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin ( 26 ,   27 ,   28 ,   29 ,   30 ).
Anthocyanins.  These compounds  are the colored pigments in fruit, and they’re associated with eye and  urinary tract health , improved memory,  healthy aging, and a lower risk of some cancers ( 31 ,   32 ).
Aromatic acids.  In  gooseberries, these include caffeic, chlorogenic, coumaric,  hydroxybenzoic, and ellagic acid.
Organic acids.  They’re  responsible for the tart taste of fruit and may reduce your risk of stroke  and Alzheimer’s disease ( 1 ,  33 )
Summary  Gooseberries are rich in  antioxidants, such as phytonutrients, and vitamins E and C, which may help  protect your brain and fight aging, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and heart  disease.

4. May help control blood sugar
High blood sugar levels are linked to type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, dementia, and many other illnesses ( 34 ,  35 ,  36 ).
Gooseberries have several properties that may aid  blood sugar control .
First, they’re high in fiber, which slows the absorption of sugar into your bloodstream, preventing  spikes in blood sugar  levels ( 13 ).
Furthermore, test-tube studies reveal that gooseberry extract is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. This means it binds to special enzymes in your small intestine, preventing them from moving sugar from your gut into your bloodstream ( 25 ).
Finally, gooseberries contain chlorogenic acid, which may slow carb absorption and help reduce blood sugar levels after starchy meals ( 25 ).
However, despite promising results, more research on gooseberries’ effect on blood sugar levels is needed.
Summary  Gooseberries are high in  fiber and chlorogenic acid, which may help slow or prevent the absorption of  sugar into your bloodstream, though more research is required.

5. May protect your brain
Certain degenerative brain diseases are linked to an overload of iron in the cells.
Iron levels that are  too high  can spur the creation of free radicals, which are molecules that damage your cells. Your brain cells are particularly high in iron, making them more vulnerable to damage ( 33 ).
Gooseberries are a natural source of organic acids, providing 11–14 mg of citric acid in 100 mg of fruit. Citric acid blocks the accumulation of iron in cells and has been found to reduce the risk of diseases like Alzheimer’s and stroke if consumed regularly ( 1 ,  33 ).
The antioxidants and phytonutrients in gooseberries are also believed to benefit age-related diseases of the  brain  and reduce your risk of stroke. Still, more research is needed ( 37 ,  38 ,  39 ,  40 ).
Summary  Gooseberries are rich in  citric acid, phenols, and antioxidants, which are linked to a reduced risk of  age-related brain diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and stroke.

6. May have anticancer effects
Diets rich in berries, phytonutrients, and antioxidants are linked to a reduced risk of some types of cancers ( 41 ,  42 ,  43 ,  44 ).
Some of the known  anticancer substances  in gooseberries are folate, phenolic compounds, and vitamins C and E ( 4 ).
These nutrients are thought to reduce, counteract, and repair damage from oxidative stress and  inflammation , which can lead to the development of cancer ( 25 ).
For example, test-tube and animal studies indicate that anthocyanins inhibit the growth of cancer cells and may reduce your risk of certain cancers, including of the colon, pancreas, and breast ( 45 ,  46 ).
However, more research is needed to determine gooseberries’ effects on cancer.
Summary  Gooseberries are rich in  antioxidants and polyphenols, such as anthocyanins, that may fight and reduce  your risk of certain types of cancer.

7. Good for your heart
Eating a diet rich in fruits like berries is associated with a lower risk of heart disease ( 47 ).
Gooseberries contain many nutrients that  promote heart health , including antioxidants and potassium.
Antioxidants improve heart health by preventing the oxidation of LDL (bad) cholesterol in your blood, a process that increases your risk for heart disease ( 48 ).
Additionally, phytonutrients like flavonols and anthocyanins help reduce blood pressure and improve blood vessel function, which may lower your risk of heart disease ( 20 ,  49 ,  50 ).
Finally, potassium is essential for good  blood vessel health . It helps maintain a regular heartbeat and blood pressure and is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke ( 51 ).
Summary  Gooseberries contain  heart-healthy antioxidants, polyphenols, and potassium, which help keep your  heart working properly and may reduce your risk of heart disease.

8. Easy to add to your diet
For maximum health benefits, it’s best to enjoy gooseberries raw.
Their flavor ranges from quite sour to relatively sweet, a little bit like slightly underripe  grapes . The riper the fruit, the sweeter it becomes.
Some gooseberries are very tart, so if you want to eat them fresh look for sweeter varieties, such as Whinham’s Industry, Captivator, or Martlet.
Before eating the berries, you should wash and prepare them. Most people prefer to chop the very bottom and top off the berry, as it can taste a little woody.
Once prepared, you can eat gooseberries as a healthy snack on their own. Alternatively, add them to a fruit salad, use them as a topping on cereal or yogurt, or mix them into a fresh summer salad.
Gooseberries are also used in cooked and baked dishes, such as pies, tarts, chutneys, compote, jams, and cordial. However, keep in mind that these dishes often contain  sugar , and cooking destroys a lot of the antioxidants and beneficial phytonutrients.
Summary  Gooseberries are best  enjoyed fresh and can be eaten on their own or added to cereal, yogurt, salads,  or a variety of other dishes. Cooked gooseberries may not have the same health  benefits, as some of the nutrients will be destroyed.

The bottom line
Gooseberries are nutritious, low-calorie fruits that are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
Though research on gooseberries specifically is limited, many of the nutrients in these berries have been linked to significant health benefits.
These include lower blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels, as well as a reduced risk of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and age-related illnesses of the brain.
Gooseberries are a wonderful, healthy fruit to include in your diet as a snack or flavorful addition to meals.
