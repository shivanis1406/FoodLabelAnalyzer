Title: How Many Calories Does Hiking Burn?

Hiking is an excellent way to stay physically active while enjoying the sights and sounds of nature.
Many people take to trails or paths for a few hours, though longer excursions can last days or weeks. The intensity varies based on the ruggedness of the terrain, as well as other factors like temperature and weather.
You may wonder how many calories hiking burns, especially compared with other forms of exercise like walking or running.
This article explains the number of calories that both casual and intense hiking burns.

Calories burned hiking
The number of calories you can expect to burn hiking depends on a variety of factors, particularly your weight and trail grade — or the steepness of the path.
This table estimates the number of calories burned per hour based on weight and trail grade at an  average walking speed  of 2.9–3.5 mph (4.7–5.6 kph) ( 1 ):
A grade of 1–5% is mild, while 6–15% ranges from medium to steep. Some trails may have a grade as high as 35%, which would burn even more calories.
You can get an idea of how different grades feel by gradually raising the incline on a  treadmill .
Other factors that influence the number of calories burned include the weight of your backpack, temperature, and your age and sex ( 2 ).
The total calories you burn hiking depends mainly on your weight and the trail grade. Choosing a trail with a higher grade increases the number of calories burned per hour.

Hiking vs. walking and running
Walking and running are other common forms of outdoor exercise that many people use to stay fit and burn calories.
While some walking terrain may be hilly, it’s generally flat.
Thus, you’re likely to burn fewer  calories when walking  — even at a brisk pace — than when hiking. Nonetheless, other factors like terrain, temperature, and your weight, age, and sex also matter ( 2 ).
The table below compares the calories burned per hour either hiking at a shallow grade of 1–5% — assuming a moderate pace of 2.9–3.5 mph (4.7–5.6 kph) — with walking on flat ground at an average pace of 3 mph (4.8 kph) or a brisk pace of 4.0 mph (6.4 kph) ( 1 ).
Hiking burns more calories because trails are generally steeper and more uneven than walking paths, neighborhood roads, or sidewalks.
Still, if you don’t have access to trails, walking steep sidewalks may be comparable to hiking.
Like walking, running tends to occur on mostly flat terrain. The calories you burn depends on your weight and running speed, among other factors.
According to data from a fitness app, the  average global running speed  is about 6 mph (9.7 kph) for women and 7 mph (11.3 kph) for men ( 3 ).
The table below compares the calories burned per 30 minutes of either hiking at a shallow grade of 1–5% — assuming a moderate pace of 2.9–3.5 mph (4.7–5.6 kph) — with running on flat ground at the average paces for women and men mentioned above ( 4 ).
As you can see,  running burns roughly double the calories  as hiking per half an hour. Still, you should keep in mind that many people hike for longer periods than they run. Thus, a hike’s total calories burned may be comparable to — or even higher than — a run’s.
The number of calories burned walking or running depends on your body weight and speed. In general, hiking burns fewer calories than running but more than walking.

Benefits of hiking
Hiking has been shown to offer several health benefits.
Depending on the duration and trail grade, hiking may burn a significant number of calories.
As such, it can aid weight loss when paired with a  healthy diet .
Of course, factors like the weather, the amount of free time you have, and your proximity to trails may limit how often you can hike — so this activity may not be a  sustainable weight loss solution  for many people.
All the same, setting the incline of a treadmill to 5% or higher may approximate a rigorous hike. You can also try walking steep sidewalks or hills.
Trail hiking may offer additional benefits that you can’t experience from walking on a treadmill.
One study found that outdoor mountain hiking led to greater improvements in mood, feelings of calmness, and  anxiety  than indoor treadmill walking ( 5 ).
Other reviews show similar results, suggesting that exercising outdoors in natural settings may lead to greater improvements in mental health than indoor physical activity ( 5 ,  6 ).
In either case, hiking or walking at an incline may likewise help build lower body strength, which is particularly important for  maintaining mobility  and avoiding injuries as you age ( 7 ,  8 ,  9 ).
Hiking may aid weight loss by increasing the number of calories you burn. Compared with indoor exercise, it’s associated with greater improvements in mental health.

The bottom line
The calories you burn hiking depends on your weight, the steepness of the terrain, and the duration of your excursion, as well as other factors like  the weight of your backpack  and temperature.
In general, hiking burns more calories than walking because it utilizes steeper paths. Yet, per half an hour, hiking burns fewer calories than running.
This form of outdoor  exercise  offers several benefits, including improvements in weight loss, mental health, and lower body strength.
