Title: 10 Healthy Herbal Teas You Should Try

Herbal teas like chamomile, peppermint, and ginger tea offer several health-promoting properties and could help improve heart health, digestion, sleep quality, and more.
Unlike true teas, which are brewed from the leaves of the  Camellia sinensis  plant, herbal teas are made from dried fruits, flowers, spices, or herbs ( 1 ,  2 ).
In addition to being delicious, some herbal teas have health-promoting properties. In fact, herbal teas have been used as natural remedies for a variety of ailments for hundreds of years.
Here is a list of 10 healthy herbal teas to try.

1. Chamomile tea
Chamomile tea is most commonly known for its calming effects and is frequently used as a sleep aid.
In fact, studies show that it could improve sleep quality in older adults and postpartum women ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
What’s more, chamomile is also believed to have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and liver-protecting effects ( 6 ).
Other research also shows that chamomile could improve blood sugar control and ease symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) ( 7 ,  8 ).
Chamomile may help enhance sleep quality, improve digestive health, stabilize blood sugar levels, and ease symptoms of PMS.

2. Peppermint tea
Though peppermint tea is most popularly used to support digestive health, it also has antioxidant, anticancer, antibacterial, and antiviral properties ( 9 ).
Several studies have shown that preparations of peppermint oil can help relieve indigestion, nausea, stomach pain, and other symptoms of  irritable bowel syndrome  ( 10 ,  11 ,  12 ).
However, keep in mind that it’s unclear whether the amount of peppermint oil found in peppermint tea has the same effect as the concentrated supplements used in these studies. Therefore, more research is needed.
Studies have found that peppermint oil may help relieve nausea, cramping, and stomach pain.

3. Ginger tea
Ginger tea packs a punch of disease-fighting antioxidants and is a well-known remedy for nausea ( 13 ,  14 ).
Studies consistently find that ginger is effective at relieving nausea, especially in early pregnancy, although it may also relieve nausea caused by cancer treatments and surgery ( 15 ,  16 ,  17 ).
Evidence also suggests that ginger may help prevent stomach ulcers, relieve  indigestion , and reduce pain associated with menstruation ( 18 ,  19 ,  20 ,  21 ).
What’s more, some studies show that ginger supplements could improve blood sugar control and lipid levels in people with  diabetes  ( 22 ,  23 ,  24 ).
Ginger tea may help reduce nausea, relieve period pain, and improve blood sugar and lipid levels in people with diabetes.

4. Hibiscus tea
In addition to its bold color and unique flavor, hibiscus tea offers healthful properties.
In fact, though research is mixed, some studies show that hibiscus could significantly reduce total and LDL (bad) cholesterol, along with blood pressure ( 25 ,  26 ,  27 ,  28 ).
What’s more, another study found that taking hibiscus tea extract for 6 weeks significantly decreased oxidative stress in male soccer players ( 29 ).
However, be sure to talk with a doctor before drinking hibiscus tea if you’re taking diuretics, as it may interact with your medications ( 30 ).

5. Echinacea tea
Echinacea tea is a popular remedy that’s said to prevent and treat the common cold.
Evidence has shown that echinacea may help boost the immune system, which could help the body defend against infections ( 31 ).

Echinacea tea is commonly used to shorten the duration of the common cold. However, more research is needed.

6. Rooibos tea
Rooibos  is an herbal tea that was historically used for medicinal purposes ( 35 ).
Though more research on humans is needed, one study found that rooibos may have anti-allergy effects ( 36 ).
Research has found that rooibos may inhibit the formation of osteoclasts. These are cells that break down old bones, which is essential for preserving, repairing, and reshaping your skeleton. Inhibiting their formation may help people living with diseases that cause the production of too many osteoclasts, such as  osteoporosis  ( 37 ).
Moreover, some older studies suggest that rooibos tea could also lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels ( 38 ).
Preliminary evidence suggests that rooibos tea may help improve bone health and reduce heart disease risk, but more studies are needed.

In one small study, drinking lemon balm tea for 6 weeks improved arterial stiffness, which is a risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and mental decline ( 45 ,  46 ).
Research has also found that drinking lemon balm may increase the body’s natural antioxidant enzymes, which help protect the body from oxidative damage ( 4 7 ).
Additionally, one review found that lemon balm could even improve symptoms of depression and anxiety, without serious side effects ( 48 ).
Preliminary studies have found that lemon balm tea may help increase antioxidant levels, improve heart health, and reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.

Studies have also found that rose hips may also be beneficial for weight management, helping decrease body mass index (BMI) and belly fat ( 50 ).
Still, more recent human studies are needed to confirm the potential benefits of rose hip tea.
Rose hip tea may reduce inflammation and pain associated with arthritis. It may also support weight management.

One study found that taking passionflower extract for 2 weeks improved certain markers of sleep quality in people with insomnia, though there was no significant difference compared with a placebo ( 51 ).
