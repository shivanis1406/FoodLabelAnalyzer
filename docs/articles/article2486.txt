Title: How Your Diet Affects Migraines: Foods to Avoid, Foods to Eat

Wondering if a certain food is contributing to your migraine attacks? We take a look at the research of dietary migraine triggers below.
Millions of people worldwide experience migraines.
While the role of diet in migraines is controversial, several studies suggest that certain foods may bring them on in some people.
This article discusses the potential role of dietary migraine triggers, as well as supplements that may reduce migraine frequency and symptoms.

Coffee
Coffee  is one of the world’s most popular beverages.
It is high in  caffeine , a stimulant also found in tea, soda and energy drinks.
Caffeine’s connection to headaches is complex. It may affect headaches or migraines in the following ways:
Migraine trigger : High caffeine intake seems to trigger migraines in certain people ( 8 ).
Migraine treatment : Combined with aspirin and Tylenol (paracetamol), caffeine is an effective migraine treatment ( 9 ,  10 ).
Caffeine withdrawal headache : If you regularly drink coffee, skipping your daily dose may cause withdrawal symptoms. These include headache, nausea, low mood and poor concentration ( 11 ,  12 ).
Caffeine withdrawal headaches are often described as throbbing and associated with nausea — symptoms similar to those of a migraine ( 13 ).
An estimated 47% of habitual coffee consumers experience a headache after abstaining from coffee for 12–24 hours. It gradually becomes worse, peaking between 20–51 hours of abstinence. This may last for 2–9 days ( 14 ).
The likelihood of  caffeine withdrawal  headaches increases as daily caffeine intake increases. Still, as little as 100 mg of caffeine per day, or about one cup of coffee, is enough to cause headaches upon withdrawal ( 12 ,  15 ).
If you get headaches because of caffeine withdrawal, you should try to maintain your coffee schedule or gradually lower your caffeine intake over the course of a few weeks ( 11 ).
Limiting caffeine intake or quitting high-caffeine beverages altogether may be the best option for some ( 8 ).

Aged cheese
About 9–18% of people with migraines report sensitivity to aged cheese ( 16 ,  17 ).
Scientists believe this may be because of its high tyramine content. Tyramine is a compound that forms when bacteria break down the amino acid tyrosine during the aging process.
Tyramine is also found in wine, yeast extract, chocolate and processed meat products, but aged cheese is one of its richest sources ( 18 ).
Levels of tyramine appear higher in people with chronic migraines, compared to healthy people or those with other headache disorders ( 19 ).
However, the role of tyramine and other biogenic amines in migraines is debated, as studies have provided mixed results ( 11 ,  20 ).
Aged cheese may also contain histamine, another potential culprit, which is discussed later in this piece ( 21 ).

Alcoholic beverages
In certain people,  alcoholic beverages  may trigger a migraine within three hours of consumption.
In fact, roughly 29–36% of those with migraines believe that alcohol may trigger a migraine attack ( 11 ,  23 ).
However, not all alcoholic beverages act in the same way. Studies in people with migraines found that  red wine  was much more likely to trigger a migraine than other alcoholic beverages, especially among women ( 24 ,  25 ).
Some evidence indicates that the histamine content of red wine may play a role. Histamine is also found in processed meat, some fish, cheese and fermented foods ( 11 ,  26 ).
Dietary histamine intolerance is a recognized health disorder. Apart from headaches, other symptoms include flushing, wheezing, sneezing, skin itching, skin rashes and fatigue ( 29 ).
It is caused by a reduced activity of diamine oxidase (DAO), an enzyme responsible for breaking down histamine in the digestive system ( 30 ,  31 ).
Interestingly, reduced activity of DAO appears to be common in people with migraines.
One study found that 87% of those with migraines had reduced DAO activity. The same applied to only 44% of those without migraines ( 32 ).
Another study showed that taking an antihistamine before drinking red wine significantly reduced the frequency of headaches among people who experience headaches after drinking ( 33 ).

Processed meat
Around 5% of people with migraines may develop a headache hours or even minutes after consuming processed meat products. This type of headache has been dubbed a “hot dog headache” ( 34 ,  35 ).
Researchers believe that  nitrites , a group of preservatives that includes potassium nitrite and sodium nitrite, may be the reason why ( 36 ).
These preservatives are often found in  processed meat . They prevent the growth of harmful microbes like  Clostridium botulinum . They also help preserve the color of processed meats and contribute to their flavor.
Processed meats that contain nitrites include sausages, ham, bacon and lunch meats like salami and bologna.
Hard-cured sausages may also contain relatively high amounts of histamine, which could trigger migraines in people with histamine intolerance ( 21 ).
If you get migraines after eating processed meat, consider eliminating them from your diet. In any case, eating less processed meat is a step toward a healthier lifestyle.

Other possible migraine triggers
People have reported other migraine triggers, although the evidence is rarely solid.
Below are a few notable examples:
Monosodium glutamate (MSG):   This common flavor enhancer  has been implicated as a headache trigger, but little evidence supports this idea ( 37 ,  38 ).
Aspartame:  A few studies have associated the artificial sweetener  aspartame  with an increased frequency of migraine headaches, but the evidence is mixed ( 39 ,  40 ,  41 ).
Sucralose : Several case reports suggest that the artificial sweetener  sucralose  may cause migraines in some groups ( 42 ,  43 ).
Citrus fruits : In one study, about 11% of those with migraines reported citrus fruits to be a migraine trigger ( 44 ).
Sucralose : Several case reports suggest that the artificial sweetener  sucralose  may cause migraines in some groups ( 42 ,  43 ).
Chocolate : Anywhere from 2–22% of people with migraines report being sensitive to chocolate. However, studies on the effect of chocolate remain inconclusive ( 11 ,  44 ).
Gluten : Wheat, barley and rye contain gluten. These cereals, as well as products made from them, may trigger migraines in  gluten-intolerant people  ( 45 ).
Fasting or skipping meals : While  fasting  and skipping meals may have benefits, some may experience migraines as a side effect. Between 39–66% of those with migraines associate their symptoms with fasting ( 46 ,  47 ,  48 ).
Studies also suggest that migraines may be an allergic response or hypersensitivity to certain compounds in foods, but scientists haven’t reached a consensus on this yet ( 48 ,  49 ).

How to treat a migraine
If you experience migraine, visit your doctor to rule out any underlying conditions.
Your doctor can also recommend and prescribe medications that might work for you.
If you suspect that certain foods trigger your migraines, try eliminating them from your diet to see if that makes any difference.
For detailed information on how to follow an elimination diet, see  this  article. Also, consider keeping a detailed food diary.

The takeaway
Scientists are not entirely sure what causes migraines.
Studies show that certain foods and beverages may trigger them. However, their relevance is debated, and the evidence not entirely consistent.
Commonly reported dietary migraine triggers include alcoholic beverages, processed meat and aged cheese. Caffeine withdrawal, fasting and some nutrient deficiencies are also suspected to play a role.
If you get migraines, a health professional can recommend treatment, including prescription medications.
Supplements like coenzyme Q10 and butterbur may also reduce the frequency of migraines in some people.
Additionally, a food diary might help you discover if any of the foods you eat are linked to migraine attacks. After identifying potential triggers, you should see if eliminating them from your diet makes a difference.
Most importantly, you should try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, avoid stress, get good sleep and eat a balanced diet.
