Title: 15 Keto Mexican Dishes (and Meal Tips)

Although it may seem difficult to eat at Mexican restaurants if you’re on the keto diet — due to high carb foods like tortillas, rice, and beans — Mexican food is one of the most flavorful, nutritious, and keto-friendly cuisines.
This is especially true if you opt to make certain dishes at home.
Here are 15 keto-friendly Mexican dishes, plus helpful cooking and ordering tips and a few simple recipes.

List of keto Mexican dishes
Fajitas are a popular sizzling-hot dish that usually includes bell pepper and onion, along with a protein like chicken, beef, or  shrimp . They’re served with tortillas, but you can skip those and just eat the fajita filling to keep it low carb.
Still, because the carbs from  onions  add up fairly quickly, it’s best to cook a small portion or split your order into two meals ( 1 ).
Carne asada is a marinated, grilled steak dish. The steak itself has no carbs, but the marinade may provide a trace amount ( 2 ).
This dish is available at many Mexican restaurants. You can purchase  raw , ready-to-grill carne asada from many Mexican markets as well.
Ceviche originated in Peru, but you can find it on many Mexican restaurant menus.
This cold dish is made from raw or precooked  seafood  — usually fish or shrimp — brined in citrus juice and mixed with veggies and herbs such as tomatoes, onion, jalapeño, and cilantro. All these ingredients are low in carbs.
If you make it at home, you can cut the amount of  tomatoes  and onion in half to reduce the carb count ( 1 ,  3 ).
Guacamole is a dip made from smashed  avocado , which is naturally high in fat and fiber and low in net carbs — total carbs minus fiber, which your body doesn’t digest.
In addition, guacamole may contain small amounts of lime juice, onion,  jalapeño , tomato, or cilantro. Although you should avoid the chips it’s typically served with, guacamole is perfectly keto-friendly ( 4 ).
Carnitas is a dish of shredded slow-cooked  pork . It’s usually made from a fatty cut like pork shoulder, and some of this fat melts during cooking to coat and flavor the meat.
The  meat  itself contains no carbs, so it’s an excellent keto-friendly choice at Mexican restaurants or to make at home ( 5 ).
This spicy shrimp dish — a staple at many Mexican restaurants — uses a sauce made from various types of  chiles  (and possibly tomatoes).
It’s low in carbs, but if it’s served with rice and beans, you may want to choose a  salad  or a side of guacamole instead — both are keto-friendly and may help temper the heat.
Tacos  al pastor are made from al pastor pork, which is thinly sliced, marinated pork shoulder. You can forego the tortillas and eat the pork by itself or with a side salad for a keto-friendly meal.
Chorizo is a Mexican sausage made from beef or pork. It’s available either  fresh  (raw and ground) or dried (cured, ready to eat, and sliceable).
All types of chorizo are low in carbs,  high in fat , and flavorful ( 6 ).
“Queso” is Spanish for “cheese,” but in the United States, this term often refers to cheese dip.
In many cases, these  dips  are very low in carbs, although some may contain carbs from milk or starch-based thickeners. Be sure to check the label, ask about ingredients, or make your own low carb version at home.
My favorite keto-friendly way to enjoy dips like queso is with  pork rinds  or homemade tortilla chips made from low carb tortillas ( 7 ).
This dip is made from tomatoes, onion, jalapeño, and  cilantro , or various combinations of these ingredients.
Salsa  contains small amounts of carbs from the tomatoes and onion, but small portions — such as 1–2 tablespoons (16–32 grams) — will flavor your meal without sabotaging your keto diet ( 8 ).
Birria is  goat meat  seasoned with various herbs, spices, and chiles. Some versions may also be made with beef. It’s used to make birria tacos or a traditional Mexican soup that’s also called birria, which contains broth and added salsa, onions, or cilantro.
Both the  soup  and the meat by itself are good keto-friendly options.
If you’re flexible with your carb intake, consider traditional tacos made with  corn tortillas , which contain fewer carbs than ones made with flour — about 7 grams of net carbs per small, 18-gram tortilla ( 9 ).
With careful planning, you may be able to eat a few regular tacos within your  daily carb limit .
Taco salads contain lettuce, tomato, cheese,  sour cream , guacamole, a meat such as seasoned ground beef or chicken, and sometimes other ingredients.
Some may be served in fried taco shells or over tortilla chips, with or without a layer of  refried beans  at the bottom. You should forego both the shell and the refried beans to keep it keto-friendly.
This breakfast dish is made from  scrambled eggs  cooked with onions, diced tomatoes, and sauteed peppers such as jalapeño.
Because it doesn’t contain tortillas or tortilla chips, it’s much  lower in carbs  than other Mexican breakfast dishes like huevos rancheros and chilaquiles.
Pico de gallo is a dip and  condiment  made from diced tomato, chopped onion, and cilantro. In small quantities, it’s low in carbs and adds a bright flavor to rich or high fat dishes. It’s also easy to make at home.

Food swaps and modification tips
Here are some tips to help you enjoy keto Mexican food at home:
Create your own seasoning blends.  Premade taco or fajita seasoning packets often contain unnecessary carbs that you can avoid by making your own seasoning blends. Try combining chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, cumin, and  cayenne pepper .
Purchase low carb tortillas.  You can still enjoy burritos and tacos as long as you buy low carb tortillas.
Use cauliflower rice and black soybeans.  In place of high carb foods such as rice and black beans, you can use  cauliflower rice  and black soybeans to save on carbs. Black soybeans are very rich in fiber, which slashes their net carb content ( 10 ).
If you’re eating at a Mexican restaurant in the United States, keep these tips in mind:
Ask that no chips be brought to the table.  Tortilla chips are high in carbs, so it’s best to skip them completely.
Order fajitas with no tortillas.  Fajitas, like several other Mexican dishes, make an ideal keto meal as long as you skip the tortillas.
Choose a simple meat entree.  Choosing a high fat,  high protein  meat dish as your main course  means you may not have to make many special requests to keep your meal keto-friendly.
Replace rice and refried beans with salad and guacamole.  Side dishes like rice and refried beans are loaded with carbs, so you should ask to swap them with  non-starchy veggies .

Remove bell peppers and onion from the skillet and add carne asada. Fry until meat is fully cooked and has some crispy edges.

Add salt and pepper to taste, but remember that carne asada is already seasoned, so you may not need much.
Squeeze lime juice over the finished fajitas, then serve with low carb toppings and sides.
