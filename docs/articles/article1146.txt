You may take probiotics to help reduce symptoms of certain medical conditions, bolster your immune health, improve depressive symptoms, and even promote weight loss or mental wellness.
Not everyone needs to take a probiotic supplement, but if you and your healthcare team decide that you may benefit from one, there are many excellent products on the market.
This article features our picks of the 12 best probiotic supplements on the market. It also explains what probiotic supplements are, who may benefit from taking one, and how to choose the right product for your needs.
$  = under $0.50 per serving
$$  = $0.50 to $1 per serving
$$$  = over $1 per serving
Note that the dosage recommendations vary between 1 and 2 capsules or tablets, taken 1 to 2 times daily. A product that you need to take once per day may be comparatively cheaper despite having a higher price per count than a product you need to take multiple times per day.

Why we love it:  Culturelle is a well-known brand of probiotics and is one of the best overall probiotic supplements thanks to its formulation and high colony-forming unit (CFU) count. Plus, it doesn’t need to be refrigerated.

One capsule of Culturelle Digestive Daily Probiotic has 10 billion CFUs of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, a probiotic strain that may benefit a number of  health conditions , such as diarrhea and  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) .
This supplement also contains 200 milligrams (mg) of the prebiotic  inulin , which fuels beneficial gut bacteria.

​​Culturelle guarantees that the stated number of CFUs on the box is viable through the expiration date of the product, something the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends customers look out for.

While products are not routinely tested for purity and potency by a third-party lab, the company states that it takes multiple measures to ensure quality and safety.
Additionally, Culturelle probiotics have been used in multiple clinical studies, and the company’s processes are audited regularly by  NSF International .
The company also makes products that are formulated to address specific needs of  men  and  women .
Healthline editor Parisa Syed bought this probiotic from  iHerb  and tried it for 1 month.
“I didn’t notice any immediate effects,” she said. “However, by the end of the month, I noticed  improvements in my typical gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as a slight reduction in  heartburn .”
Syed said that she took the probiotic with her other medications each morning and didn’t experience any negative side effects, even after taking it on an empty stomach.
“The pill is a bit bigger than usual, but I’m used to taking big pills, so it went down easy for me,” she added.

Why we love it:  Ritual’s Synbiotic+ stands out from others on the market because it contains pre-, pro-, and postbiotics to support overall gut health. It’s also been helpful for our tester, who has been taking the supplement for nearly 2 years.
Postbiotics  are bioactive compounds that bacteria secrete, often through fermentation. While postbiotics are believed to offer some  health benefits , research on the subject is limited.

Ritual’s Synbiotic+ contains probiotic strains, such as  Lact o bacillus  rhamnosus , that may be beneficial for people with IBS, though more research is needed.

The company conducted a  test-tube study  that suggested Synbiotic+ could support gut barrier function and increase the growth of beneficial bacteria. But keep in mind that because Ritual funded the study, there is a risk of bias.

Ritual’s Synbiotic+ has been a staple supplement in Healthline editor Christy Snyder’s routine for over 2 years now, ever since she originally tried it in July 2022.
“I’ve struggled with digestive issues for years and was excited to try out Synbiotic+ as a possible replacement for the expensive pre- and probiotics that I was taking,” Snyder said.
She said that she didn’t experience an adjustment period or any negative side effects when she first started taking it and found that it was already helping with her bloating after only a few weeks.

“Overall, I’ve had a great experience and will be replacing my old supplements with Ritual Synbiotic+,” she said.

Why we love it:  Mindbodygreen Probiotic+  is third-party tested, contains clinically tested probiotic strains to help alleviate bloating, and was highly reviewed by our tester.
This supplement provides a blend of  Bifidobacterium lactis  strains, as well as Lactobacillus acidophilus, both of which have the potential to help with  bloating  and  immune function.
Specifically, this probiotic contains Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07 to help beat bloating.  Research from 2011  found that abdominal bloating improved significantly over 8 weeks of treatment with this probiotic strain compared with placebo. However, more robust recent research is lacking.

This probiotic received a rave review from Healthline editor Kristin Currin-Sheehan, who said that she was impressed and pleased by how gently regular it made her. She reports that she also saw and felt a reduction in bloating and even lost an inch in her midsection.
“The first thing I noticed, though, was my  mood being boosted ,” said Currin-Sheehan. “My anxiety deflated some and my overall sense of well-being improved. It was so refreshing.”

Why we love it:  Seed DS-01 is a subscription-based company with an eco-friendly approach to probiotics.
Customers receive their first orders in a refillable glass jar, which is used for subsequent refills. In addition to a 30-day supply of the synbiotic, first time users are also given a handy travel-sized glass vial.
Seed DS-01 contains a comprehensive blend of probiotics. Each 2-capsule serving delivers 24 different probiotic strains, including  Lactiplantibacillus plantarum  and  Bifidobacterium lactis , both of which may be beneficial for heart health.
The supplement also stands out for including non-fermenting prebiotics that are compatible with a low  FODMAP diet .
Seed probiotics undergo extensive testing throughout the manufacturing process and on final products to ensure purity and potency.
It’s worth noting that Seed DS-01 uses  AFUs  (active fluorescent units) instead of CFUs to measure the number of viable probiotic cells per dose.  Research  suggests that because AFUs are able to measure all viable cells, including those that may not be culturable, AFUs are a more accurate measure than CFUs.

Two of our testers tried Seed probiotics and both experienced positive results for bloating.
Healthline senior director Rita Mauceri is in her 50s and dealing with some mild symptoms of menopause. “With  menopause  can come some weight gain and, in my experience, more frequent bloating,” said Mauceri.
After trying Seed for several weeks, she found it significantly alleviated her symptoms. “I’ve tried two to three probiotics in the past, and definitely liked Seed above the others. I found if I skipped taking the daily dose of DS-01 Synbiotic, my bloating typically returned,” she said.
“I also really like what the company stands for in terms of quality of ingredients and sustainability,” Mauceri said. She points out that the packaging is very appealing and user-friendly as well.
When asked about the price point, she had this to say: “There are certainly cheaper options but also pricier ones. Given the fact that it worked really well for me and made me feel better overall, I felt it was worth the price.”
Healthline editor Lois Zoppi also tested Seed probiotics and found herself pleasantly surprised. “I have  IBS symptoms  that are exacerbated by other medications I take. I have only tried probiotics once before and didn’t have much success with them, so I went into testing Seed with low expectations,” she said.
Zoppi started taking 1 capsule per day and noticed that it helped with both bloating and cramps after just 5 days.
Upon going up to the full dose of two capsules per day, Zoppi’s IBS symptoms worsened. “As they were being compounded with the medication that was also messing with my stomach, I decided to just stick with the starting dose of 1 capsule a day,” she said.
“After going back down to the single daily dose, the flare-ups stopped and I’m back to having far less bloating and cramping than before.”

Why we love it:  Jarrow Formulas Jarro-Dophilus EPS is a third-party tested, multi-strain probiotic that’s impressively affordable. We also like that the capsules have an enteric coating, which is a barrier that helps minimize degradation in the stomach.
Some studies show that enteric-coated probiotics are more effective than non-enteric-coated probiotics. A  2019 study  found that enteric coating led to a 20‐ to 40‐fold increase in the delivery of viable probiotics to the small intestine.
If the product is stored properly — at room temperature in a cool, dry environment — the 5 billion CFU count per capsule is guaranteed through the “best used before” date.

Almost immediately after trying this supplement, Healthline editor Alice Porter experienced noticeable benefits. “The evening I took my first dose I didn’t experience any usual gas or bloating,” she said, adding that there were also no side effects the next day, like increased gas or stomach upset.
While Porter did later notice some minor side effects like stomach noises and bloating, she explains that these stopped completed after a few days of taking the supplements consistently.
“After a week of taking these probiotics, I noticed a slight improvement in regularity and reduction in stomach issues, though not a complete elimination of any bloating or discomfort,” she said.
“Ultimately, I prefer taking my probiotics in liquid or edible form. However, these are superior in terms of convenience and cost.”

Why we love it:  In addition to being manufactured by a trustworthy brand, this probiotic supplement contains Lactobacillus gasseri and L. rhamnosus,  probiotic strains  that may help support weight loss.
Research shows  that people who are overweight are more likely to have  dysbiosis  (an imbalance in gut bacteria) and lower bacterial diversity than people who are not. This may increase hunger and increase energy storage in fat tissues, which contributes to weight gain.

Taking a probiotic supplement containing specific probiotic strains, such as Lactobacillus gasseri, L. rhamnosus, and L. plantarum, may help  promote weight loss  in several ways, including by decreasing gut permeability, reducing inflammation, and increasing bacterial diversity.

Garden of Life guarantees the CFU count through the end of the product’s “best use” date if it’s stored properly. This supplement keeps best in the refrigerator.

According to the company, Garden of Life supplements are third-party tested. However. the company does not disclose the name of the testing organization.

Though Kristin Currin-Sheehan didn’t experience the same level of results with this probiotic as she did with mindbodygreen and other brands, she said that she was very impressed with Garden of Life’s customer service.
“I also appreciate it’s a raw supplement,” she added, explaining that she prefers probiotics extracted from whole food ingredients and prefers to avoid synthetic probiotics, bioengineered supplements, and artificial flavors or ingredients.
“Garden of Life is among my shortlist of clean vitamins and supplements:  from soil to bottle ,” Currin-Sheehan said.

Why we love it:  Klean Athlete’s probiotic contains a broad spectrum of strains along with a prebiotic blend,  making it suitable  for various digestive symptoms.
This probiotic includes  Lactobacillus rhamnosus  and  Bifidobacterium lactis , both of which can help with bloating and abdominal pain, as well as a prebiotic blend containing  fructooligosaccharides  and  slippery elm bark .
It’s also NSF Certified for Sport and free from wheat, gluten, and artificial coloring.

Healthline editor Kristin Currin-Sheehan uses probiotics to help  manage anxiety  and alleviate digestive issues like bloating.
After trying this supplement, she experienced increased regularity and even noticed improvements to her  mood and mental clarity .
“With Klean Athlete Probiotic, I started to become regular gently and thoroughly, throughout the day,” she said. “I’d also had a bout of  tonsil stones  recently due to postnasal drip, and the prebiotic and probiotic formula helped to eradicate this built-up bacteria within 10 days’ time!”
Currin-Sheehan also pointed out that this supplement features acid-resistant capsules, which helps more beneficial bacteria reach the large intestine.
However, while she didn’t notice any side effects like bloating, Currin-Sheehan said this supplement did cause more gas than other probiotics, which could be due to its prebiotic blend.

Why we love it:  Florastor Daily Probiotic contains a probiotic yeast called  Saccharomyces boulardii  that research suggests may be helpful for managing symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

The strain  has also been shown to help with diarrhea, especially antibiotic-associated or  acute diarrhea .

At the time of publication, Florastor Daily Probiotic has a 4.7 out of 5-star rating on Amazon and more than 9,000 total reviews. Customers note that the probiotic is effective for reducing gas and bloating, though many also feel that it’s a bit too expensive.

The supplement comes in a vegetarian capsule and is non-GMO and gluten-free. However, because it contains lactose, it’s not suitable for those who have a dairy allergy.

It’s unclear whether these probiotics are tested to ensure purity and potency. While Florastor doesn’t mention third-party testing on the company’s website, the product is sold by CVS, which  requires  third-party testing on all of its dietary supplements.
When Healthline editor Crystal Hoshaw first opened this supplement, she was struck by the fact that only half of the bottle was filled. “They could have put twice the amount of pills in the bottle, which seems wasteful,” she said.
Regardless, Hoshaw notes that she appreciates that the glass bottle is recyclable, compact, and easy to slip into her bag.
“The pills go down easily and have had the desired effect,” she said. “My bowel movements have been regular while taking, which is nice.”

Why we love it:  This product is formulated specifically for men’s health, with ingredients like  curcumin , which is a powerful antioxidant that may benefit prostate health, though the  research  on this is mixed.
It also contains several probiotic strains, including  Lactiplantibacillus plantarum,  which may be beneficial for heart health, as well as  Bifidobacterium longum , which has been found to benefit those with significant IBS-related symptoms.
Hyperbiotics Pro Men is vegan, gluten-fee, non-GMO, and produced in an NSF certified GMP facility, but the products are not third-party tested.

Healthline writer Timothy Jewell gave these probiotics a try, hoping to maintain regularity in spite of  factors that increase constipation , such as stress, exertion, or diet changes.
After just 3 days, Jewell noticed an improvement in regularity, noting that diet or activities no longer seemed to affect his bowel movements, which is usually not the case.
“I have continued to notice regularity after almost a week of use and also noted that I haven’t felt any  bloating  since I began using them,” he said.
“I also found that my bowel movements were less difficult or intense … [and] noticed much less bloating than I usually have, even after having  fried foods or sugary treats  that would sometimes make me feel a little swollen.”

Why we love it:  Rael’s vegan and allergen-free probiotic supplement is designed specifically with women in mind. It contains five different strains of probiotics, including  Lactobacillus acidophilus  and  Lactobacillus reuteri , both of which may support vaginal health.

It also contains 25% of the daily value for  vitamin D , which many women tend to be deficient in.

A small  clinical trial  found that 4 out of 5 women with self-reported bacterial vaginosis experienced improved vaginal and digestive health after taking Rael Vaginal Health Probiotic Supplement for 12 weeks. However, it’s important to note that the trial was self-funded and more research is needed.

According to the website, Rael’s products are third-party tested and produced in a GMP certified facility, but the testing organization is not disclosed.


Although Healthline editor Sarah Choi didn’t experience any notable benefits after taking this probiotic for 1 week, she also didn’t notice any side effects and was pleasantly surprised by how easy they were to swallow.
Additionally, she appreciated the convenience of this supplement and said she had a great experience trying it.
“I was glad that it was a one-and-done situation, and I wasn’t stuck taking a pill two or three times a day,” she said. “I’m a pretty forgetful person when it comes to taking pills, so that was a plus.”
Choi also said the probiotic didn’t have any aftertaste, even after holding the capsule in her mouth.

Avoid taking probiotics before consulting a healthcare professional. They can help you decide whether a probiotic supplement is appropriate and provide brand and dosage recommendations.

How we chose the best probiotic supplements
We selected the best probiotics using the following criteria:
Vetting:  All the products have been vetted to ensure that they meet Healthline’s medical and business standards, adhere to FDA regulations on allowable health claims and labeling requirements, and are manufactured in facilities that adhere to current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs) established by the FDA.
Credibility:  The products we chose are made by medically credible companies that follow ethical, legal, and industry best standards and that provide objective measures of trust, including having supplements thoroughly tested for purity and potency, ideally by third-party organizations.
Effective dose:  Except one product (which doesn’t use CFUs), all the supplements above contain at least 10 6  (1 million) CFUs per gram.
Ingredients:  We looked for products that are made from high quality ingredients and free of artificial additives and fillers.
Personal needs:  We included options to suit various needs and preferences, whether you need a specific probiotic strain or follow a gluten-free diet.
Reviews:  We included options that were either tested and recommended by Healthline editors or that have overall positive reviews online.
The World Health Organization  defines  probiotics as “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.”  Probiotics  are found naturally in  certain foods , and are also found in your gut.
Probiotics are also available in supplement form. These supplements contain  high doses  of either a single probiotic strain or multiple probiotic strains.

What are the benefits of taking probiotics?
Probiotic supplements have been linked to some  health benefits . But while research on probiotics has increased significantly over the past 20 years, researchers are still learning about them and their health effects.
Probiotics may:
Improve symptoms of IBS:  Research  suggests that probiotics, especially multistrain products containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, may help improve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), such as bloating and abdominal pain.
Help with diarrhea:  Studies indicate that probiotics may help improve multiple types of  diarrhea , including  infectious  diarrhea,  antibiotic-associated  diarrhea, and  travelers’  diarrhea. Certain strains, including  Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG  and  Saccharomyces boulardii , seem to be particularly effective for treating diarrhea in children and adults.
Help with constipation:  Some probiotics, such as ​​Bifidobacterium lactis, may help improve constipation. However,  study results vary , with some showing no improvements in constipation with probiotics.
Help reduce UTI frequency:  Some  studies  show that taking probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 may help reduce  urinary tract infections (UTIs)  in women. However, study results are  conflicting .
Promote immune health:  Evidence supports the role of probiotic supplements in  maintaining  immune health. Several studies suggest that probiotics may  enhance  immune function in  certain populations , but more research is needed.
Benefit metabolic health and weight management:  Alterations in gut bacteria may contribute to obesity and metabolic issues, and some studies show that probiotic supplements may  promote weight loss .  Research  in this area is ongoing.
Improve cardiovascular risk factors:  Probiotic supplements may help reduce  blood lipid levels  in some  people , which may  decrease  the risk of heart disease. However, evidence is limited at this time.
Help treat certain mood and emotional disorders:  Studies suggest that certain probiotics may help  reduce symptoms  of depression and anxiety, but more high quality studies are needed before strong conclusions can be made.
Probiotics are generally measured in colony-forming units (CFUs). These units represent the number of viable bacteria per dose.
Products labeled “1 x 10 9  CFU” contain 1 billion viable or live bacteria per dose. Most supplements contain  1 to 10 billion CFUs  per dose, but some contain much larger amounts.
For beneficial effects, probiotics must be taken in quite large doses. Researchers suggest that probiotics must contain  at least 10 6  (1 million)  viable CFUs per gram to be able to survive digestion and exert positive effects in the body.

How to choose the best probiotic supplement for you
If you’re interested in taking a probiotic supplement, it’s important to first determine whether a probiotic supplement is necessary for your specific health needs.
If you’re instructed to take a probiotic, consider the following:
Probiotic strains:  Probiotics are not one-size-fits-all remedies, and  certain probiotic strains  are much more effective for certain medical conditions and symptoms than others. Look for supplements with specific strains based on your needs.
Intended use:  The effectiveness of probiotic supplements is not only strain-specific but also disease-specific, meaning the correct strain and dose must be  appropriate  for the condition or symptom you intend to treat.
Brand:  Manufacturing processes, shelf life, and formulation type can  significantly affect  a probiotic supplement’s effectiveness. Therefore, it’s essential to buy probiotics from established, physician-trusted brands.
Storage requirements:  Some probiotics require refrigeration. Check the product label for proper storage instructions. In general, probiotics are sensitive to heat. Thus, if they don’t require refrigeration, you’ll want to store them in a cool, dry area.
CFUs:  The product quality matters. It’s important to look for probiotics that contain at least  10 6  (1 million)  CFUs per gram, as research suggests that this is the minimum amount needed to exert positive effects in the body.
Also keep in mind that because probiotics are quite vulnerable to factors such as temperature change and storage time, many may no longer be viable by the time you purchase them.
For this reason, the  National Institutes of Health (NIH)  recommends that customers choose products that list the CFUs at the end of a product’s shelf life. This indicates that a product contains a therapeutic number of CFUs after the product is purchased.

To use or not to use probiotics?
Contrary to popular belief, probiotic supplements are not necessary or appropriate for most people.
Not only can they be expensive, but they may lead to  side effects  such as bloating — which was the experience of one of Healthline’s editors and testers — and  bacterial overgrowth .
Plus, probiotic supplements could  lead to  excessive immune stimulation and infection among people with weakened immune systems.
While some people, including those with IBS and certain types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), may benefit from specific strains of probiotics, most healthy people who follow a nutritious diet and healthy lifestyle do not need to take probiotic supplements.
What’s more, some researchers are  concerned  that the widespread use of probiotics may lead to antibiotic resistance and warn that many studies investigating the safety and effectiveness of probiotics are poor quality.
For these reasons, avoid taking probiotics before consulting a healthcare professional. They can help you decide whether a probiotic supplement is appropriate and give brand and dosage recommendations.

When to talk with a doctor
If you’re experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, cramping, diarrhea, and constipation; have received a diagnosis of IBD or IBS; or are concerned about your  vaginal health , you may benefit from a probiotic.
But it’s a good idea to schedule an appointment with a healthcare professional first because your symptoms could be related to a condition that requires a specific treatment or medication.
Additionally, taking a probiotic can do  more harm  than good in some individuals, so it’s important to discuss options with a trusted expert before trying anything new.

Frequently asked questions about probiotic supplements
Because probiotics are strain-, disease-, and symptom-specific, no single probiotic is more effective overall than others. An effective probiotic supplement contains one or more probiotic strains that have been clinically shown to help with the symptoms you’re experiencing.
Still, some brands are considered to offer higher quality probiotic supplements, including Culturelle, Seed, and Jarrow Formulas.

Still, some brands are considered to offer higher quality probiotic supplements, including Culturelle, Seed, and Jarrow Formulas.
Because research on the  safety  and effectiveness of probiotics in people without existing health conditions is still  inconclusive , it’s best to talk with a healthcare professional before starting a daily probiotic.
Because research on the  safety  and effectiveness of probiotics in people without existing health conditions is still  inconclusive , it’s best to talk with a healthcare professional before starting a daily probiotic.

The bottom line
Probiotic supplements may be helpful for people with certain conditions, such as IBS, constipation, and UTIs.
However, probiotics aren’t necessary for everyone, and the effectiveness of probiotic supplements depends on the strain, dosage, and condition being treated.
Finally, there are many other ways to take care of your  gut microbiome  and overall health that don’t involve dietary supplements, including following a nutrient-dense diet, managing your stress levels, and maintaining a moderate weight.
