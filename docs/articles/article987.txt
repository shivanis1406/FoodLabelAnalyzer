Title: Lactobacillus rhamnosus: A Probiotic With Powerful Benefits

Lactobacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus) is a gut-friendly bacteria available as a dietary supplement and added to various foods like dairy products. It can help relieve IBS symptoms and diarrhea, enhance your gut health, and defend your teeth against decay.
The human body contains 10–100 trillion bacteria ( 1 ).
Most of these bacteria live inside your gut, collectively known as microbiota. They play an important role in maintaining optimal health.
While there are many benefits to having a healthy balance of gut bacteria, an imbalance is linked to numerous diseases ( 2 ,  3 ).
One of the most well-studied friendly bacteria is L. rhamnosus.
This article reviews the benefits, side effects, and dosage of  L.   rhamnosus .

What Is Lactobacillus rhamnosus?
L. rhamnosus  is a type of bacteria found in your intestines.
It belongs to the genus  Lactobacillus , a type of bacteria that produce the enzyme lactase. This enzyme breaks down the sugar lactose — which is found in dairy — into lactic acid.
Bacteria from this genus, such as  L. rhamnosus , are considered  probiotic .
Probiotics are live microorganisms that can offer health benefits when consumed ( 4 ).
Hundreds of studies support the benefits of  L. rhamnosus .
Uniquely adapted to survive in acidic and basic conditions within your body, this bacterium can also adhere to and colonize your intestinal walls. Such characteristics give  L. rhamnosus  a better chance of survival — so it may offer longer-term benefits ( 5 ,  6 ).
There are many different strains, each with different characteristics ( 7 ).
L. rhamnosus  is available as a probiotic supplement and often added to yogurts, cheeses, milk, and other  dairy products  to boost probiotic content.
It can also be added to dairy for other reasons. For example,  L.rhamnosus  plays a key role in cheese ripening, which enhances flavor ( 8 ,  9 ).
However, many products that contain  L. rhamnosus  don’t typically include it in the ingredients list.
L. rhamnosus  is a member of the probiotic  Lactobacillus  genus of bacteria. It is adapted to survive in your gut, thus potentially offering longer-term benefits.

Potential Health Benefits and Uses
L. rhamnosus  has numerous potential benefits and uses for your digestive system, as well as other areas of health.
Diarrhea is a common issue sometimes caused by bacterial infection.
In most situations, diarrhea is relatively harmless. However, persistent diarrhea can cause fluid loss, which may lead to  dehydration .
Studies show that  L. rhamnosus  may help prevent or treat various types of diarrhea.
For example,  L. rhamnosus  may protect against antibiotic-related diarrhea.  Antibiotics  can disrupt microbiota, which may result in digestive symptoms like diarrhea ( 10 ,  11 ).
For instance, a review of 12 studies in 1,499 people found that supplementing with a specific strain called  L. rhamnosus  GG reduced the risk of antibiotic-related diarrhea from 22.4% to 12.3% ( 12 ).
In addition, taking a probiotic during and after antibiotic use can help restore your healthy gut bacteria, since antibiotics often kill them alongside harmful bacteria.
What’s more,  L. rhamnosus  may protect against various other types of diarrhea, such as traveler’s diarrhea, acute watery diarrhea, and acute gastroenteritis-related diarrhea ( 13 ,  14 ,  15 ).
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 9–23% of adults worldwide ( 16 ).
While its cause is unknown, IBS causes uncomfortable symptoms, such as  bloating , abdominal pain, and unusual bowel movements ( 16 ).
Interestingly, there may be a link between IBS and changes in the body’s natural gut flora.
For instance, people with IBS may have fewer  Lactobacillus  and  Bifidobacterium  bacteria but more potentially harmful  Clostridium ,  Streptococcus , and  E. coli  ( 17 ,  18 ).
Human studies note that  Lactobacillus -rich foods or supplements may relieve common IBS symptoms, such as abdominal pain ( 19 ,  20 ,  21 ).
Additionally, animal studies have found that  L. rhamnosus  strains may strengthen gut barriers, which may help  relieve IBS symptoms  ( 22 ).
However, more research in humans is needed before recommendations can be made.
Like other probiotic bacteria,  L. rhamnosus  is great for your digestive health.
It belongs to the  Lactobacillus  family, which produces lactic acid. Lactic acid helps prevent the survival of potentially harmful bacteria in your digestive tract.
For instance,  L. rhamnosus  can prevent  Candida albicans , a type of harmful bacteria, from colonizing your intestinal walls ( 23 ).
L. rhamnosus  not only prevents bad bacteria from colonizing but also encourages the growth of beneficial bacteria, such as  Bacteroides , Clostridia, and bifidobacteria ( 24 ).
What’s more,  L. rhamnosus  helps increase the production of  short-chain fatty acids  (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate ( 25 ).
SCFAs are made when your healthy gut bacteria ferment fiber inside your digestive tract. They are a source of nourishment for the cells lining your colon ( 26 ).
In addition, studies link SCFAs to various benefits, including protection against colon cancer, weight loss, and  lower blood sugar levels  ( 27 ,  28 ,  29 ).
Dental  cavities  are a common occurrence, especially in children ( 30 ).
They’re formed by harmful bacteria in your mouth. These bacteria produce acids that break down your enamel, or the outer layer of your teeth ( 31 ).
Probiotic bacteria like  L. rhamnosus  have antimicrobial properties, which may help fight these harmful bacteria ( 32 ).
In one study, 594 children received either  regular milk  or milk containing  L. rhamnosus  GG for 5 days per week. After 7 months, children in the probiotic group had fewer cavities and a lower number of potentially harmful bacteria than children in the regular-milk group ( 33 ).
Another study in 108 adolescents found that taking a lozenge containing probiotic bacteria — including  L. rhamnosus  GG — significantly reduced bacterial growth and gum inflammation, compared to a placebo ( 34 ).
That said, more human studies are needed before recommendations can be made.
A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection that can happen anywhere along your urinary tract, including your  kidneys , bladder, and urethra.
It is much more common in women and typically caused by two strains of bacteria —  Escherichia coli  ( E. coli ) and  Staphylococcus saprophyticus  ( 35 ,  36 ).
Some studies indicate that probiotic bacteria, including certain strains of  L. rhamnosus , may prevent UTIs by killing harmful bacteria and restoring vaginal flora.
For instance, an analysis of 5 studies in 294 women found that several  Lactobacillus  bacteria, including  L. rhamnosus , were safe and effective at preventing UTIs ( 37 ).
Other studies discovered that the  L. rhamnosus  GR1 strain — given either orally or intravaginally — was particularly effective at killing harmful bacteria in the urinary tract ( 38 ,  39 ).
However, not all  L. rhamnosus  strains may help  treat UTIs . For example,  L. rhamnosus  GG strains don’t attach well to vaginal walls and may not be effective ( 40 ).
While these findings are promising, more human research is needed.
L. rhamnosus  has been linked to several other potential health benefits. However, these properties are backed by fewer or weaker studies:
May promote weight loss.  L. rhamnosus  may  suppress appetite  and food cravings, especially in women ( 41 ,  42 ).
May increase insulin sensitivity.  Animal studies show that several  L. rhamnosus  strains may improve  insulin sensitivity  and blood sugar control ( 43 ,  44 ,  45 ,  46 ).
May reduce blood cholesterol.  One mouse study found that  L. rhamnosus  lowered blood cholesterol levels and had a similar effect on cholesterol metabolism as statins, a class of drugs that helps treat high cholesterol ( 47 ).
May fight allergies.   L. rhamnosus  strains may help prevent or relieve allergy symptoms by promoting the growth of friendly gut bacteria and suppressing the growth of harmful bacteria ( 48 ,  49 ,  50 ).
May help treat acne.  In a small study in 20 adults, taking an  L. rhamnosus  SP1 supplement helped reduce the appearance of acne ( 51 ).
L. rhamnosus  may boost your overall digestive health, potentially treating diarrhea, relieving IBS symptoms, and strengthening your gut. It may also protect against cavities and UTIs. A number of other potential benefits haven’t been rigorously tested.

Dosage and Recommendations
L. rhamnosus  probiotic supplements can be purchased in health food stores or  online .
They can contain only  L. rhamnosus  species or these species combined with other probiotic bacteria.
Probiotic bacteria are measured by the number of living organisms per capsule, known as colony-forming units (CFU). A typical  L. rhamnosus  supplement holds approximately 10 billion live bacteria — or 10 billion CFU — per capsule.
For general health, 1 capsule containing at least 10 billion live bacteria is sufficient.
To help prevent antibiotic-related diarrhea, take 2 capsules of  L. rhamnosus GG  daily providing 10 billion live bacteria or 1 capsule with over 20 billion live bacteria ( 52 ).
Take the  probiotic supplement  a few hours after your antibiotic(s), then continue for at least one week after your course of antibiotics to help restore a healthy gut.
Dosage guidelines have not been established for other uses of  L. rhamnosus , but experts suggest that a similar daily dose may be appropriate.
Keep in mind that  L. rhamnosus  is sometimes added to dairy products — such as  yogurts  and milk — to boost their probiotic content and to cheeses to aid the ripening process.
L. rhamnosus  can be taken as a probiotic supplement and is often added to various foods, especially dairy products. This means that your diet may naturally provide an extra dose of this bacterium.

Safety and Side Effects
L. rhamnosus  products are generally safe and well tolerated with few side effects.
In some cases, people may experience symptoms like stomach bloating or gas ( 53 ).
That said, people with compromised immune systems — such as those with HIV, AIDS, or  cancer  — should avoid  L. rhamnosus  and other probiotics (or dairy products with added probiotics), as such supplements may cause an infection.
Likewise, if you’re taking drugs that may weaken your immune system — such as steroid drugs, cancer drugs, or medication for an organ transplant — you should avoid taking probiotics.
If you fall into these criteria or are concerned about  side effects , consult with your medical provider before taking a probiotic supplement or dairy products with added probiotics.
L. rhamnosus  is generally safe with few side effects. However, those with compromised immune systems or taking certain medications should avoid taking probiotics or first consult with a medical professional.

The Bottom Line
L. rhamnosus  is a type of friendly bacteria naturally found in your gut.
Its health benefits include relieving IBS symptoms, treating diarrhea, strengthening your gut health, and protecting against cavities.
L. rhamnosus  is available as a probiotic supplement and found in some dairy products.
