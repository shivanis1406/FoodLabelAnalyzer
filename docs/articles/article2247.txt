Referred to as “Food of the Gods” by the Mayan people, chocolate continues to be a popular treat around the world ( 1 ).
Although it’s best known for its flavor, chocolate may offer some health benefits as well. For example, it’s high in protective plant compounds like flavonoids, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties ( 1 ).
While chocolate can fit into a healthy diet, not all chocolate products are created equal. Many are high in calories, added sugars, and highly processed ingredients.

Pros:  limited ingredients, low in added sugar
Cons:  can be hard to find in stores
JOJO’s Original Chocolate Bars are the best overall healthy chocolate snack option, as they’re chocolatey and crunchy while being high in protein and fiber to help keep you satisfied for longer.
They’re also made with just five high quality ingredients, including dark chocolate, almonds, pistachios, dried cranberries, and  hemp protein .
Made from hemp seeds, hemp protein is one of the few plant-based protein sources that contains all nine  essential amino acids , making it a source of complete protein ( 2 ,  3 ).
In addition to a short ingredient list, JOJO’s bars are vegan, gluten-free, certified non-GMO, soy-free, and paleo-friendly.
One bar (34 g) provides 180 calories, 13 g of fat, 6 g of saturated fat, 12 g of carbs, 4 g of fiber, 8 g of sugar (including 7 g of added sugars), and 5 g of protein ( 4 ).
These bars come in three additional flavors — peanut butter, macadamia coconut sea salt, and raspberry almond pistachio. All of these contain at least 3 g of plant-based protein and fewer than 200 calories per serving.
Sweetened with erythritol, the raspberry and macadamia flavors are free from added sugar.
Dark chocolate contains a higher percentage of cocoa than milk chocolate — usually at least 70% cocoa. As a result, dark chocolate is high in  polyphenols , which are plant compounds with potent antioxidant activity ( 5 ,  6 ).
In fact, observational studies have linked eating antioxidant-rich dark chocolate to benefits for heart health and brain function ( 6 ,  7 ,  8 ).
While dark chocolate is often lower in sugar and added fats than milk chocolate, dark chocolate products may still be high in  added sugars . As a result, it’s important to look at both the nutrition fact label and ingredient list before buying a product.

However, the company ceased its participation in this certification program in 2021, and its products are no longer recommended as low FODMAP options ( 16 ).

How to choose a healthier chocolate snack
The best chocolate snack for you depends on your dietary needs and preferences. For example, given that chocolate often contains dairy,  vegans  or those with a lactose intolerance or dairy allergy will want to look for products that are certified vegan-friendly or dairy-free.
Additionally, some products are richer and meant to be enjoyed in small quantities, while others are lower in calories or saturated fat, so a larger portion may fit within your daily nutrition targets.
Regardless of the type of product you’re hoping to buy, you’ll want to look for a product that’s low in added sugars and made with high quality ingredients.
Ideally, look for a product that’s free of unnecessary additives, or contains small amounts of them, as they may indicate that the product is more highly processed.
Diets high in highly processed foods have been linked to an increased risk of obesity, heart disease, and all-cause mortality ( 31 ,  32 ,  33 ,  34 ).
Finally, while some chocolate snacks may be healthier than others, it’s still important to be aware of serving sizes, as calories and sugar can add up quickly.
