Title: Noom Diet Review for 2024: A Registered Dietitian Weighs In

Noom is a popular weight loss app that focuses on behavior change to support weight loss. While the app has many benefits, it also has a few downsides worth considering.

Healthline diet score: 4.25 out of 5
Since its inception in 2008, the Noom diet, or Noom, has quickly grown to become one of the most searched diets.
According to Noom, people who use the program and adopt a healthy lifestyle can expect to lose 1 to 2 pounds (lb) (0.5 to 1 kilogram [kg]) per week.
But you may wonder whether Noom is just another fad diet or an effective program for healthy, sustainable weight loss.
While I know people who use Noom on a regular basis, I decided to try the platform myself to see whether it’s a program I’d recommend to others.
This article covers everything you need to know about Noom, including what it is and how it works, what I liked, and what I think could be better.
Overall score:  4.25
Weight loss:  5
Adherence:  4.75
Whole body health:  3.5
Nutrition quality:  4
Health promotion:  4
BOTTOM LINE: The Noom diet encourages you to eat low calorie, nutrient-dense foods and monitors your progress via a mobile app.
Although its well-established methods are likely effective, it focuses mostly on weight loss. The  food psychology of Noom  says sets it apart from other diet programs is laced through its education courses and modules.

What is Noom?
Noom is a mobile app you can download to your smartphone or tablet. Because the program focuses on behavioral changes, Noom calls itself a lifestyle, not a diet.
The app provides:
Weekly challenges and educational information:  Topics involve nutrition,  stress management , goal setting, and healthy habit formation.
Tools to track your progress:  These allow you to log your meals, exercise regimen, and body weight.
A virtual coaching team:  Noom guides, and interest-based communities, known as Noom Communities, are meant to help you stay on track through video chats, phone calls, and in-app messaging. Individualized support with Behavior Change Coaches is also available via phone and Zoom for an additional fee.
Biometric tracking:  These features help you monitor your blood sugar and blood pressure levels.
Noom offers a 7-day trial if you’d like to test it out before paying the monthly fee.

recommends a low number of calories, which may not be suitable for everyone
can be tedious and time consuming to log foods

Who tried it

What I liked (and didn’t love) about Noom
Here are some things I liked about Noom during my experience:
App:  The Noom app is well-designed, intuitive, and easy to use.
Quiz:  The online quiz developed a customized plan based on my needs and goals and allowed me to reflect on the habits, behaviors, and environmental factors that may contribute to my eating patterns.
Daily lessons:  I felt the daily lessons were simple and straightforward yet informative. Being able to select the amount of time you want to spend on these daily lessons is also very useful, especially for those who want to spend only a few minutes per day on the app.
Support:  The Noom guides were helpful and offered resources, advice, and support, which can definitely be an advantage if you have trouble  staying motivated . Additionally, Noom Communities can help you connect with others to foster a sense of support within the community.
On the other hand, back in 2022, I thought certain factors could be improved:
Food tracking:  When it came to logging my foods each day, I felt the food tracker tool was somewhat cumbersome and confusing. As mentioned above, certain foods were categorized as green in one entry but yellow or orange (previously red) in others. 2024 Update:  The Noom app has introduced features to enhance the food logging user experience. Nutrition and food information are now more visible, allowing Noomers to see the calorie quantity and color category of a food item right next to its name without needing to click on it.
Categories:  The criteria used to define the color-coded system can confuse newbies. For example, several foods low in calories and high in  fiber  or protein were categorized as orange (previously red) or yellow. For example, a fiber crispbread with just 20 calories and 4 grams of fiber in a single serving was classified as an orange food. Noom clarification:  The [color category] classification is not solely based on calorie content but also considers the overall health impact of the food. The same food could be categorized differently based on its preparation method, e.g., fried or sauteed with oil vs. air-fried or steamed.
Calorie goals:  The number of calories in my daily budget felt very low, especially compared with what I normally eat in a day while maintaining my weight. However, I appreciated that I could easily adjust this as needed to set a more realistic and sustainable goal.

How to get started
If you’re ready to try Noom, here are the steps you can take to get started.
To start with Noom, you take a simple quiz on the company’s website or the app.
The quiz collects information about your age, weight, health status, and fitness goals. It also asks for details about your current diet, activity levels, and any  habits  or behaviors that may affect your health.
Here are a few of the questions the quiz asked me:
What feelings are you hoping to achieve during your journey with Noom?
Which best describes the area you live in?
How long has it been since you were at your ideal weight?
Have any life events led to weight gain in the last few years?
The app uses information from the online quiz to create a custom plan and provide a realistic timeline for reaching your goals.
As I went through the quiz, the app adjusted my estimated timeline for reaching my target weight based on my answers.
Noom requires users to spend just a few minutes per day on the app. The app provides daily educational articles, tips, and activities you can complete at your own pace.
The app also encourages you to log your food intake, exercise, and weigh-ins, send messages to your Noom guide, and join Noom Communities, which are coach-led, interest-based communities, for added support.
Additionally, Noom offers an in-app reward system called NoomCoin. It’s designed to increase motivation to help you complete your daily tasks.
You can easily customize the amount of time you want to spend on Noom lessons each day and can choose from specific ranges, including:
1 to 4 minutes
5 to 8 minutes
9 to 12 minutes

How does Noom work?
Here’s a closer look at how Noom works and how it may support weight loss.
Noom aims to help you  lose weight  the same way as most other commercial diet plans and programs by creating a calorie deficit.
A calorie deficit  occurs  when you consistently consume fewer calories than you burn each day.
Noom uses an algorithm to estimate your  daily calorie needs  based on your sex, age, height, weight, and answers to a series of lifestyle questions. When I used Noom, this was known as your calorie budget. Now, Noom provides an ideal calorie range, which is known as your weight loss zone.
For safety reasons and to ensure  adequate nutrition , the app does not allow a weight loss zone below 1,200 to 1,320 calories for women or 1,400 to 1,540 calories for men.
Noom encourages food logging and weekly weigh-ins. These two self-monitoring behaviors are  associated  with weight loss and long-term weight loss maintenance.
Noom also allows you to view an analysis of your foods as you log them throughout the day. It displays the color categories of the foods you’ve eaten, the number of calories you’ve consumed from each category, and your total calorie intake for the day.
When I tried Noom, the color categories were green, yellow, and red. The company has since updated its categories, replacing red with orange.
Noom encourages regular exercise by setting daily step goals and providing a generic workout guide.
Users can log their physical activity in the app, which provides an extensive list of exercises to choose from. Because I have an iPhone, Noom automatically connected to my Health app to display my total daily steps.
Noom also allows users to track several other measures of progress, including water intake and mood.
If they like, users can enable notifications to set up meal reminders at specific times during the day.

How much does Noom cost?
Noom offers the following subscription plans:
Monthly auto-renewing plan:  $70
2-month auto-renewing plan:  $129
3-month auto-renewing plan:  $159
4-month auto-renewing plan:  $169
5-month auto-renewing plan:  $174
6-month auto-renewing plan:  $179
7-month auto-renewing plan:  $184
8-month auto-renewing plan:  $189
9-month auto-renewing plan:  $195
10-month auto-renewing plan:  $199
11-month auto-renewing plan:  $205
Annual auto-renewing plan:  $209
If you’re confident you’ll use Noom for more than a few months, the company’s yearly membership, at $209 per year, provides the best value. Noom also offers discounts frequently throughout the year.
If you work for a company that offers a workplace health and wellness program, you can contact the human resources department to determine whether you may receive a financial incentive for participating in a wellness program like Noom.
Still, starting at $70 per month for a monthly auto-renewing plan, Noom may cost more than you’re willing or able to spend.
Note:   Noom Med  — Noom’s weight loss medication service — costs an additional $49 per month and does not include the cost of any medications you might be prescribed.
For an additional cost, Noom offers several optional add-ons.
You can choose from:
customized  meal plans  (pdf format)
customized workout plans (pdf format)
a metabolism test kit
a mental wellness course
behavior change coaching
prescription weight loss medications
You can also purchase a smart scale for an additional fee. A smart scale tracks your body weight and several other body composition metrics.
Noom recently introduced their new program,  Noom Med , which is intended to be paired with their behavior change program to promote weight loss.
After signing up, you complete a medical intake form, upload a copy of recent blood work, and schedule a video visit with a Noom clinician.
The clinician then assesses whether you’re a candidate for prescription weight loss medications, including  GLP-1 agonists . These medications work by  reducing  your appetite, slowing the emptying of the stomach, and increasing feelings of fullness after you eat.
If you qualify for a prescription, your care team will also provide ongoing support, monitor your progress, and adjust your care plan as needed while taking these medications.
Optionally, you can add a mental wellness course to your subscription for $50. It’s designed to help you minimize stress and manage cravings.
You can also purchase a subscription to work with a Behavior Change Coach for a monthly recurring fee of $150.
According to the company’s customer service team, Behavior Change Coaches can help refine your goals based on your lifestyle and needs. They provide additional support via email, phone, video sessions, or in-app messaging.
Noom also offers a separate program called  Noom Mood . It’s designed to help you practice mindfulness and better manage stress levels. However, you cannot enroll in both Noom Mood and the weight management program simultaneously.
Noom recently partnered with Everlywell, which offers an  at-home metabolism testing kit .
The testing kit is designed to measure levels of  thyroid hormones ,  cortisol , and  free testosterone . All these hormones are involved in weight management and metabolism.
Users can purchase the kit when signing up or directly on Everlywell’s website. However, because of state regulations, the testing kit is not currently available for residents of New York.

What can you eat on Noom?
Noom categorizes foods as green, yellow, or orange (previously red) based on their calories and  nutrient density .
The app recommends consuming a set percentage of foods from each color category:
30% green
45% yellow
25% orange
Users receive a target calorie range for their weight loss zone and are allotted a specific number of calories from each category.
For example, of my total daily 1,350-calorie budget, my calorie distribution for each category was as follows:
Green foods:  405 calories
Yellow foods:  608 calories
Red (now classified as orange) foods:  337 calories
According to the Noom website, here are examples of foods for each color:
Fruits:  bananas, apples, strawberries, watermelon, blueberries
Vegetables:  tomatoes, cucumbers, salad greens, carrots, onions, spinach
Starchy vegetables:  parsnips, beets, sweet potatoes, squash
Dairy:  skim milk, nonfat yogurt, nonfat Greek yogurt, nonfat cheese sticks
Dairy alternatives:  unsweetened almond, cashew, or soy milk
Whole grains:  oatmeal, brown rice, whole grain bread, whole grain pita, whole grain pasta, whole grain tortilla, whole grain cereals
Condiments:  marinara, salsa, sauerkraut, ketchup, light mayo
Beverages:  unsweetened tea and  coffee
Lean meats:  grilled chicken, turkey, and lean cuts of beef, pork, and lamb
Seafood:  tuna, salmon, tilapia, scallops
Dairy:  low fat milk, low fat cheeses, low fat cottage cheese, Greek yogurt
Legumes and seeds:  lentils, pinto beans, chickpeas, peas,  quinoa , black beans, soybeans
Grains and grain products:  couscous, white rice, white bread, white pasta
Beverages:  diet soda, light beer
Meats:  ham, red meats, fried meats, bacon, sausage, hot dogs, hamburgers
Nuts and nut butters:  peanut butter, almond butter, almonds, walnuts
Desserts and sweets:  cake, chocolate, cookies, candy, pastries
Snack foods:  french fries, potato chips, energy and snack bars
Condiments and toppings:  butter,  mayonnaise , ranch dressing
Beverages:  wine, juices such as orange juice
Remember that, depending on their preparation method, some foods may not necessarily fit into the categories exactly as outlined above.
For example, when logging sweet potatoes, I found that certain entries — such as grilled sweet potatoes, boiled sweet potatoes, and sweet potato wedges — were classified as green foods. But others — including mashed sweet potatoes, baked sweet potato fries, and oven-roasted sweet potatoes — were yellow foods.
Noom explains this is because some preparations typically require ingredients that can lower the color category, including sugar, more salt, cream, or oil.

Can Noom help you lose weight?
After using Noom for several weeks, I felt that the app made it easier to decrease my calorie intake by categorizing foods as orange (previously red), yellow, or green.
I can see the simple color-coded system helping promote  long-term weight loss , especially when it’s combined with the quick and easy daily lessons for developing healthy habits.
Though I personally didn’t track my weight while trying the app, my mom has used Noom twice with great results. In 2021, she lost about 20 lb (9 kg) over 4 months.
A  2023 study  also found that most overweight Noom users experienced lasting weight maintenance for 1 or even 2 years after leveraging a digital commercial behavior change program.
Recently, she started using it again and has lost 10 lb (4.5 kg) in 1 month. (Of course, the amount of weight you can or should lose will vary based on factors such as your height, weight, age, food intake, and activity level.)
My mom, Kathy Link, 67, attributes much of her success to her group and personal coach. Both provided motivation and support to help her stick to her diet and reach her goals.
While any reduced-calorie diet plan or program can help you lose weight if you follow it, sticking with a diet  can be difficult  for many people. In fact, most  diets are unsuccessful  because they’re difficult to maintain.
While research on Noom’s effectiveness is limited, one  2016 study  involving nearly 36,000 Noom users found that 78% experienced weight loss while using the app for an average of 9 months, with 23% experiencing more than a 10% loss compared with their starting weight.
Researchers also found that those who  tracked their diet  and weight more frequently were more successful at losing weight.
Additionally, a  2020 study  including 225 adults with  binge eating disorder  found Noom to be more effective at reducing the number of days participants engaged in binge eating over 52 weeks than standard care.
It’s important to note that the study above was funded in part by Noom, and several authors have conflicts of interest because they’re employed by or have equity ownership in Noom.
Overall, more comprehensive research on the program is needed.

What are the benefits of Noom?
Noom’s program emphasizes a long-term approach to weight loss. It may have several benefits over quick-fix methods.
Focuses on calorie and nutrient density:  The program categorizes foods by color — green, yellow, or orange — based on their  calorie density  and nutrient concentrations. In addition to helping you  lose weight  by eating fewer calories, this categorization system encourages a more nutrient-rich, balanced diet.
No food is off-limits:  Overly restrictive diets  can promote  disordered eating, which may lead to  eating disorders  or obsessive behaviors surrounding healthy or “clean” eating. Noom takes the opposite approach, offering flexibility by allowing all foods to fit into your diet.
Promotes behavior change:  Noom uses a psychology-based curriculum that  encourages  self-efficacy. This is the belief in your ability to execute the habits necessary to reach your goals. In this way, Noom may better equip you with the tools and education necessary to make the behavioral changes that underlie successful long-term weight loss maintenance.

Cons and other factors to consider about Noom
While Noom is a comprehensive tool you can use to help you reach your health goals, there are a few things to keep in mind about the app, including:
It requires a smartphone or tablet and access to wifi or cellular data.
It doesn’t offer in-person interaction with coaches or communities.
There’s an additional cost for personal coaching.
The coaches aren’t qualified to replace a  registered dietitian  or doctor.
Tracking food intake  may promote  disordered eating patterns, such as  food anxiety  and excessive calorie restriction.
Other considerations include concerns over calorie goals, limited focus on overall health, and potential weight regain.
Several reviewers note that Noom recommended a calorie goal that was quite low and significantly less than their typical intake. I also found this to be true.
Cutting calories too drastically can have  negative effects , including making it more difficult to stick with your new diet. Noom allows users to adjust their calorie goals.
However, without the help of a trained nutrition professional, such as a registered dietitian, many people may not realize that their goals need adjustment.
Noom mostly focuses on promoting weight loss by reducing calorie intake. Educating people on the psychology of their relationship with food and making healthy food choices is embedded in Noom’s educational programming on the app.
Studies — like this  2021 study  of 65 overweight women in their 20s — do demonstrate that supportive psychotherapy helps weight loss.
However, weight loss is just one piece of the puzzle regarding health.
In fact, many other factors are just as important, including maintaining your  mental health , getting enough sleep every night, exercising regularly, and managing your stress levels.
Although Noom offers some advice and educational resources on these topics, it’s not designed to specifically address these other pillars of health.
Additionally, many nutritious and health-promoting foods are categorized as yellow or orange. This implies that these foods are less healthy or should be limited as part of a balanced diet.
While Noom emphasizes that all foods can fit into a healthy diet, the color-coding system and categorization of foods may give some users the impression that calorie content is the most important factor to consider when building a balanced diet.
As with most diets that focus on calorie reduction, there’s a chance you  may regain  any weight you’ve lost once your diet ends.
While Noom encourages making sustainable lifestyle changes, some users may find their new habits difficult to maintain without ongoing accountability.
Additionally, given that Noom categorizes foods based on their calorie content, some foods higher in calories may actually be beneficial for maintaining your weight.
For example, nuts and nut butters are considered orange foods because they are calorie-dense due to their high fat content. However, eating healthy high fat foods, including nuts,  has been shown  to aid prevention of weight gain and weight maintenance.
Trying to “do it right” when it comes to nutrition may feel tempting, but it can backfire.  If you’re preoccupied with food or your weight, feel guilt surrounding your food choices, or routinely engage in restrictive diets, consider reaching out for support. These behaviors may indicate a disordered relationship with food or an eating disorder.
Disordered eating and eating disorders can affect anyone, regardless of gender identity, race, age, socioeconomic status, or other identities.
Any combination of biological, social, cultural, and environmental factors can cause eating disorders — not just by exposure to diet culture.
Feeling empowered to talk with a qualified healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian, is welcome and wise.

Customer reviews and brand reputation
Noom is accredited by the  Better Business Bureau  and holds an A+ rating from the organization.
As with many  weight loss apps  and programs, Noom’s reviews are mixed.
Positive reviews note that the program provides plenty of guidance, support, and motivation and is effective for long-term weight loss.
on the other hand, less favorable reviews report issues with the food tracker and the app’s functionality, as well as dissatisfaction with the responsiveness and level of support Noom guides offer.

How does Noom compare with other weight loss programs?
Many popular weight loss plans have several similarities to Noom.
Here’s a closer look at how Noom stacks up against two competitors:  Calibrate  and  WeightWatchers .
Noom and WeightWatchers are two of the most popular diet programs. Both offer simple, user-friendly mobile apps and promote weight loss by encouraging healthy food choices and lifestyle changes.
However, they also have several differences.
Susanne Arthur, a former senior editor for Psych Central, has a unique perspective, as she has tried both programs firsthand.
Arthur first joined WeightWatchers in 2014, based on a friend’s recommendation. Thanks to the accountability and support she found in weekly in-person meetings, she reached her goal weight and maintained it for a year.
She said she continued using the WeightWatchers app for several years on and off before moving to Iceland, which rendered many useful features, such as the barcode scanner, useless. Additionally, without the in-person meetings, she found that WeightWatchers wasn’t as beneficial.
Arthur joined Noom in August 2021. She said several app features are very helpful, including its intuitive design, the ability to set your own speed for weight loss, and the support from a personal coach.
However, she pointed out that Noom lacks some features of the WeightWatchers app, including the ability to  plan meals in advance .
Furthermore, while Noom’s group feature can be useful, Arthur said the in-person WeightWatchers meetings made it easier to feel motivated and engaged.
“I think, for me at least, online support alone only goes so far. It is a supportive tool, but there can be a lot of challenges as well. I believe in order for me to be successful, I’d need in-person support. So, I think if WeightWatchers were available in Iceland with in-person meetings, I’d go back to that and prefer WeightWatchers over Noom,” Arthur said.

Who is Noom good for?
Noom may be a good option for people who:
are trying to lose weight but unsure how to get started
need extra motivation from coaches or peers to stay on track
are looking to build healthy habits and seeking a more sustainable alternative to  fad diets  and other short-term solutions
However, Noom might not be ideal for:
people who regularly cook homemade meals, since logging each individual ingredient may feel tedious or inconvenient
people who enjoy cuisines from a variety of cultures or use ingredients in their cooking that are less common in the United States, as the selection of foods available on the app is somewhat limited
people who are very active or have increased calorie needs, as Noom provides  very low calorie  recommendations
If you’re unsure  how many calories  you should consume each day, I recommend reaching out to a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian.
Additionally, if you have any underlying health conditions, such as  type 2 diabetes  or  kidney disease , you should talk with a healthcare professional before changing your diet.
