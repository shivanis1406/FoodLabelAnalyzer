Title: 12 Healthy Protein Shakes for Weight Gain

Gaining weight requires eating more calories than you burn. Protein shakes or smoothies with ingredients like bananas, eggs, yogurt, avocado, and tofu can give the right nutrition without causing bloating.
If you’re trying to gain weight, eating enough calories on a consistent basis may be a challenge.
One common strategy is to take advantage of liquid calories from protein shakes and smoothies. These beverages provide a concentrated source of nutrients such as protein, carbs, and fats, plus vitamins and minerals, without making you feel overly full.
Here are 12 of the top protein shake recipes to aid weight gain.

1. Chocolate peanut butter shake with Greek yogurt
What’s better than chocolate and peanut butter?
This scrumptious shake uses Greek yogurt as the main protein source and includes high calorie ingredients like peanut butter and honey to promote weight gain.
1 large banana
3/4 cup (180 mL) whole milk
3 tbsp. (21 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 cup (170 grams) full fat plain  Greek yogurt
1 tbsp. (21 grams) honey
1 tbsp. (16 grams)  peanut butter

3/4 cup (180 mL) pasteurized  egg whites
1/2 cup (72 grams) fresh or frozen strawberries

The protein smoothies above use a variety of nutritious ingredients to get you started. Don’t be afraid to experiment with some of your favorite ingredients to come up with combinations of your own.
Try this today:  Take advantage of fats. Fats contain 9 calories per gram, while both protein and carbs contain 4 calories per gram.
