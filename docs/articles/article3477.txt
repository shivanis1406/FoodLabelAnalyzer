Title: How to Get Mounjaro (Tirzepatide) and What to Know in 2024

Learn how to get Mounjaro, a prescription medication used to treat diabetes. Here’s what to know about whether you might qualify, how much it costs, and options for getting it in person or online.
Mounjaro (tirzepatide) is a type of dual glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) agonist and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) agonist  approved  by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to help manage blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes, alongside diet and exercise.
It’s an injectable medication administered once  weekly. It  mimic s the effects of GLP-1, a hormone that stimulates the secretion of insulin to regulate blood sugar levels.
It also reduces hunger and increases feelings of fullness by slowing digestion, which may lead to weight loss.
This article examines how to get Mounjaro, including its cost and how to find out whether you qualify.

All the options below offer Mounjaro to eligible individuals.
Typically, a type 2 diabetes diagnosis is required for Mounjaro’s insurance approval. If you don’t have diabetes but want to take Mounjaro for weight loss, your healthcare professional will decide if Mounjaro is a safe and appropriate choice based on your health needs.
Additionally, due to occasional  supply chain issues , Mounjaro may be difficult to get, and your healthcare professional may recommend an  alternative .
Finally, because of  concerns around safety , the FDA warns against consuming  compounded  versions of injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist medications,  including tirzepatide and semaglutide .
You can consult a healthcare professional to ensure you receive non-compounded, FDA-approved GLP-1 medications.

How do you get Mounjaro?
Mounjaro is only available through a prescription, which can be obtained through specific  telehealth platforms  or by visiting a doctor.
The best way to get a prescription for Mounjaro is by visiting a medical office.
Licensed healthcare professionals can provide a prescription, including primary care doctors,  endocrinologists , bariatric doctors, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners.
A provider will likely conduct an exam and ask questions about your medical history, health status, and weight loss goals to determine whether you’re a prescription candidate.
They can also provide information about any necessary lab work or  blood tests  required before starting the medication.
Once you have a prescription, you can order and pick up Mounjaro directly through your preferred pharmacy.
We asked  Janelle Duah , MD, Assistant Professor of Medicine at Yale School of Medicine, to explain what individuals should expect to discuss during their initial consultation.
According to Duah, individuals should be prepared to talk about their:
weight loss goals
current diet, including a 24-hour recall
physical activity (type, intensity, duration, and frequency)
stress and mood
sleep habits
personal medical history
family medical history
current medications
allergies
pertinent labs
Several telehealth platforms offer prescriptions for  GLP-1 medications , including Mounjaro.
Typically, these platforms provide a virtual consultation with a healthcare professional to determine whether or not you’re eligible and discuss an appropriate treatment plan based on your needs.
If you qualify, you can typically order the prescription directly through the platform. Sometimes, you can also opt for home delivery or pick up your prescription at your local pharmacy.
Here’s a closer look at some telehealth companies that can prescribe Mounjaro.

Noom  (also known as Noom Weight) is a popular weight loss app. It uses psychology-based strategies to help users better understand their habits around eating and lay the foundation for a healthier lifestyle through small, realistic changes.
For individuals who aren’t able to lose weight through diet and exercise alone, the company offers Noom Med — an additional subscription that features medical-based strategies to support weight loss efforts.
Noom Med subscriptions include ongoing access to a licensed healthcare professional who can determine whether you’re eligible for Mounjaro and make adjustments to your prescription as needed.
Noom Med is available to some employees through Noom for Work. However, if your employer doesn’t offer this benefit, you’ll need to subscribe to both Noom Med and Noom Weight.

How much does Mounjaro cost?
The price of  Mounjaro  can vary quite a bit depending on many factors, including insurance coverage, pharmacy, and prescribed dose.
Without insurance, the manufacturer’s list price of Mounjaro is  $1,069.08  per fill, which includes a 4-week supply of the medication.
However, discounts are also available through services like  Optum Perks , which offers discounts at certain pharmacies.
If you have insurance, it’s best to contact your insurance company directly to ask whether they cover Mounjaro. Some insurance companies only cover the cost for its FDA-approved use as a type 2 diabetes medication. It’s not FDA-approved for weight loss in people without diabetes, though it’s sometimes prescribed off-label.
Some people with insurance coverage may also be eligible for a  Mounjaro savings card  from the manufacturer, which provides a 1-month or 3-month prescription for as little as $25.
Even if you have insurance that doesn’t cover Mounjaro, you may still be eligible for a savings card that can save you up to $573 on a one-month prescription.

Who can take Mounjaro?
Although Mounjaro is sometimes  prescribed off-label  for weight loss, it’s currently only FDA-approved as a type 2 diabetes medication.
FDA approval means that the FDA has determined that a drug is safe and effective for a specific use and that the benefits of using the drug to treat the condition outweigh its risks.
Another medication —  Zepbound  — includes the same active ingredient as Mounjaro. Zepbound is FDA-approved as a weight loss medication. Except the FDA approvals, there’s no difference between the two medications.
Other GLP-1 agonists that are FDA-approved to aid weight loss include semaglutide ( Wegovy ) and  liraglutide (Saxenda) .
In general, GLP-1 agonists may be prescribed for weight loss in people with a  body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher  or individuals with a  BMI of 27 or higher  and at least one weight-related condition, such as:
high blood pressure
type 2 diabetes
prediabetes
polycystic ovary syndrome
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
obstructive sleep apnea
A licensed professional will usually only prescribe a GLP-1 agonist for weight loss after you have tried other  weight loss methods  — including dietary changes, exercise, and other lifestyle changes — without success.
A doctor can help determine whether you might be eligible for a prescription.
In addition to determining whether you might be eligible, a healthcare professional can also guide you on how to use Mounjaro alongside other lifestyle modifications for  effective weight management , including diet and exercise.

Who shouldn’t take Mounjaro?
Although Mounjaro is considered safe when used appropriately, it’s not the right choice for everyone.
Mounjaro isn’t safe for those with certain health conditions, including people who’ve had thyroid tumors or a type of  thyroid cancer  called  medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) . People with a family history of MTC should also avoid Mounjaro.
Mounjaro is also unsafe for those with a history of:
multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2)
diabetic retinopathy
severe gastrointestinal disease
conditions affecting the pancreas and kidneys
In addition, people who are hypersensitive to Mounjaro’s active ingredient, tirzepatide, should not take Mounjaro. Hypersensitivity could lead to life threatening side effects, such as  anaphylaxis  and  angioedema , or swelling of the deeper layers of the skin .
There is not enough evidence that Mounjaro is safe to take during pregnancy and while breastfeeding and  findings from some animal studies  suggest that Mounjaro may be harmful to fetuses. If you’re pregnant or nursing, a doctor may recommend alternative medications that are safe to use.

Side effects of Mounjaro
The most  common side effects  of Mounjaro are:
nausea
diarrhea
decreased appetite
vomiting
constipation
stomach discomfort
stomach pain
Using Mounjaro with other diabetes medications may lead to dangerously  low blood sugar  levels, which is why Mounjaro should be prescribed and monitored by a licensed healthcare professional, such as an endocrinologist.
Keep in mind that to maintain weight loss with Mounjaro, you’ll need to take the medication indefinitely. A 2023 clinical trial found that stopping tirzepatide (the generic for Mounjaro) resulted in “substantial regain” of any weight lost while taking the medication.
When deciding whether to take Mounjaro, consider how the medication cost will factor into your budget in the long term.
