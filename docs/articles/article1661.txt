Title: 12 Healthy Ancient Grains



Ancient grains tend to be les processed than modern grains, like corn and wheat. Because of this, ancient grains have more vitamin, mineral, and fiber content. Including ancient grains in your diet may come with health benefits.
Ancient grains are a group of grains and pseudocereals (seeds that are consumed like grains) that have remained mostly unchanged for thousands of years.
They’re dietary staples in many parts of the world, such as China, India, Africa, and the Middle East. Today, ancient grains are becoming more popular in Western countries.
That’s because they tend to be less processed and pack more vitamins, minerals, and fiber than more widespread grains like corn, rice, and modern wheat.
In addition, studies have linked ancient grain consumption to health benefits, such as lower heart disease risk, better blood sugar control, and improved digestion ( 1 ,  2 ).
Here are 12 healthy ancient grains.

1. Amaranth
Amaranth is a nutritious, gluten-free grain that has been cultivated for more than 8,000 years ( 3 ).
One cup (246 grams) of cooked amaranth contains ( 4 ):
Calories:  251
Carbs:  46 grams
Protein:  9 grams
Fat:  4 grams
Fiber:  5 grams — 20%  of the Daily Value (DV)
Manganese:  91% of the DV
Magnesium:  38% of the DV
Iron:  29% of the DV
Thanks to its impressive nutrient composition,  amaranth  has been linked to numerous benefits, including decreased heart disease risk and inflammation ( 5 ,  6 ).
For example, an animal study found that a diet high in amaranth significantly reduced total cholesterol while raising HDL (good) cholesterol levels, compared to diets high in other grains ( 6 ).
Amaranth can be easily used in place of  rice , couscous, and quinoa. Alternatively, you can add amaranth to soups or stews to add bulk and thickness.

2. Millet
While best known as an ingredient in birdseed, millet is a nutritious, ancient pseudocereal considered a staple throughout China, India, Africa, Ethiopia, and Nigeria.
One cup (174 grams) of cooked millet boasts ( 7 ):
Calories:  174
Carbs:  41 grams
Protein:  6 grams
Fat:  2 grams
Fiber:  2 grams — 8% of  the DV
Manganese:  21% of the DV
Magnesium:  19% of the DV
Thiamine  (vitamin B1):  15% of the DV
Millet contains a variety of nutrients linked to lower inflammation, reduced heart disease risk, and improved  blood sugar control  ( 8 ,  9 ).
For example, a study in 105 people with type 2 diabetes found that replacing rice with millet in a meal reduced post-meal blood sugar levels by 27% ( 10 ).
Millet is versatile and  gluten-free . It can be enjoyed as a hot breakfast cereal or in place of other grains like rice, couscous, and quinoa.
If you can’t find millet in your local grocery store, you can easily purchase it  online .

3. Khorasan wheat (kamut)
Khorasan wheat, also known as kamut, is a high-fiber, nutrient-dense grain that is linked to health benefits.
One cup (172 grams) of cooked kamut offers ( 11 ):
Calories:  227
Carbs:  48 grams
Protein:  10 grams

Kamut may be especially beneficial for reducing blood sugar levels and heart disease risk factors like LDL (bad) cholesterol ( 12 ).
A 4-week study in 22 people found that a kamut-based diet suppressed hormones that promote inflammation and reduced total  cholesterol  by 4%, LDL (bad) cholesterol by 8%, and blood sugar levels by 4%, compared to a semi-whole-grain diet ( 13 ).
This grain contains gluten, which makes it unsuitable for people with  celiac disease , non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergies.
Kamut has a chewy, nutty texture with grains two to three times the size of wheat grains. It’s an excellent addition to soups, stews, casseroles, and summer salads.
You can find it in specialty stores, as well as  online .

4. Sorghum
Sorghum is the fifth most consumed grain worldwide and a great source of nutrients ( 14 ).
Per 3.5 ounces (100 grams), uncooked sorghum provides ( 15 ):

Selenium:  22% of the DV
Sorghum is not only high in nutrients but also but also a good source of powerful polyphenol plant compounds, including anthocyanins and phenolic acids, which function as antioxidants inside your body ( 16 ).
Antioxidants  neutralize potentially harmful molecules called free radicals, which can cause cellular damage and increase disease risk when they accumulate in your body ( 17 ).
Unlike many other grains, sorghum is naturally gluten-free and can be easily  ground into flour  for gluten-free baking. Its mild flavor makes it very versatile.

5. Teff
Teff is the world’s smallest grain, at approximately 0.7–1% the size of a wheat kernel ( 18 ).
Per 3.5 ounces (100 grams), uncooked teff contains ( 19 ,  20 ):

Manganese:  402% of the DV
Copper:  90% of the DV
Vitamin C:  98% of the DV
Magnesium:  44% of the DV
Iron:  42% of the DV
Phosphorus:  34% of the DV
Zinc:  33% of the DV
Although teff grains are tiny, they’re packed with important nutrients, such as  iron  and magnesium. They are also one of the few grains that boast  vitamin C , a nutrient vital for immune and bone health ( 20 ).
In Ethiopia, conditions like iron deficiency anemia are quite rare, possibly due to this nation’s high consumption of teff grains ( 21 ).
For example, a study in 592 pregnant Ethiopian women found that eating teff daily was linked to a significantly lower risk of anemia than eating teff less frequently ( 22 ).
Teff is also gluten-free and can be used in porridge, soups, stews, and gluten-free baked goods. It’s available  online  and in some stores.

6. Freekeh

Fat:  2.5 grams
Fiber:  10 grams — 40%  of the DV
Iron:  20% of the DV
In particular, freekeh is a good source of the carotenoids  lutein and zeaxanthin . A higher intake of these compounds has been linked to a lower risk of degenerative eye disorders, such as cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) ( 25 ,  26 ).
As freekeh contains  gluten , people with celiac disease and other gluten-related conditions should avoid it.
Freekeh has an earthy, nutty taste, with a chewy texture like that of brown rice. As a versatile grain, it makes an excellent addition to soups, stews, casseroles, and summer salads.
If it’s hard to find at your usual grocery store, shop for it  online .

Magnesium:  26% of the DV
Due to its high fiber content, rye and rye-based products may be more effective at  alleviating constipation  than wheat-based products and laxatives ( 46 ).
In addition, a higher intake of fiber-rich whole grains, such as rye, is linked to a  reduced risk of certain cancers , including breast and colorectal cancers ( 47 ,  48 ,  49 ).
Although rye is very healthy, it’s worth noting that it’s not a gluten-free grain.

12. Fonio
Fonio is a type of millet that’s widely consumed in West African countries. The two most common varieties are white fonio ( Digitaria exilis ) and black fonio ( Digitaria iburu ).

It may contain resistant starch, which passes through your digestive tract without being broken down and feeds your  healthy gut bacteria  ( 52 ).
These bacteria break down resistant starch into  short-chain fatty acids  (SCFAs), which may help lower blood sugar and inflammation, among other benefits ( 53 ,  54 ).
Fonio is not widely available in the United States but can be purchased  online . It can be ground to make a delicious gluten-free flour for baking or cooked for a fluffy, couscous-like texture.
Summary  Fonio is popular in West  African countries and believed to contain resistant starch, which is linked to  many health benefits.

The bottom line
Ancient grains have gained popularity in recent years because they tend to be less processed and boast more vitamins, minerals, and fiber than more common  grains .
Diets higher in ancient grains have been linked to health benefits, such as improved blood sugar and  reduced inflammation , as well as heart disease and cancer risk.
Plenty of ancient grains are also gluten-free, such as quinoa, millet, fonio, sorghum, amaranth, and teff. These are suitable for people who cannot tolerate gluten or wheat.
Try incorporating a few of these ancient grains into your diet to reap their health benefits.
