Title: Diet and Fitness Tips for Menopause: An Essential Guide

Nutritional and exercise needs change as you age, and menopause is no exception. Focusing on omega-3s, preserving bone and brain health, and doing low-impact fitness exercises can all help support you during this life transition.
Menopause is a significant transition in a person’s life, marking the end of menstruation and a shift in hormonal balance. Typically occurring in the late 40s to early 50s, this natural phase can bring a variety of symptoms—ranging from hot flashes and mood swings to sleep disturbances—that can impact daily life.
While the changes experienced during menopause may seem daunting, the good news is that making informed choices about nutrition and fitness can play a crucial role in managing symptoms and enhancing overall well-being during this time.
We’ll explore effective diet and exercise strategies designed to support your body through menopause, helping you navigate this phase with greater ease and vitality.

Nutrition needs during menopause
It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when menopause-related hormonal changes begin. Oftentimes, they’re signaled by  various symptoms , including:
hot flashes
problems sleeping
vaginal dryness
night sweats
mood swings
aching joints
depression
fatigue
If these symptoms begin before your periods stop, you’re likely in a transitional phase called perimenopause. You may also experience lighter or shorter periods that may come either more or less often than usual.
Twelve months without a period is the more definitive marker of menopause.
In terms of your diet, you’ll want to hone in on foods that help keep your  heart healthy , your bones strong, and your brain sharp — while lowering your intake of foods that trigger symptoms. Whole foods like fruits, veggies, and whole grains may be particularly helpful.
Although the right diet won’t eradicate your symptoms, it may help you feel better and alleviate day-to-day side effects.
Sarcopenia , or the progressive loss of lean muscle mass, is common as your body ages. In fact, a 3–8% loss of lean muscle mass per decade is thought to begin in a person’s 30s.
As you age, this percentage becomes significant because the loss of lean muscle mass increases your risk of fractures and falls.
Nonetheless, eating 25–30 grams of protein at each meal may  protect against this loss of lean muscle mass .
High quality protein sources include eggs, dairy, beef, seafood, and poultry like chicken or turkey. Plant-based foods — such as tofu, beans, other legumes, nuts, some meat alternatives — can also contribute to daily protein needs.
Eating foods that are high in  leucine , a building block of protein, may also optimize muscle creation and retention in older adults. Most protein sources  contain leucine . Animal products and some plant proteins, such as soy, are particularly good sources.
Strength training  is also vital for building and maintaining a healthier body as you age. Walking, yoga, and even housework can also help keep your muscles strong.
Osteopenia is a reduction in bone mass that’s more common in older adults.
If left untreated, it may lead to osteoporosis, which is a porousness in your bones that makes you particularly susceptible to sudden breaks or fractures.
Foods  rich in calcium  and vitamin D help keep bones strong, which is pivotal during menopause — especially since osteopenia and osteoporosis are common right before, during, and after menopause due to the decrease in estrogen.
Dairy products, sardines, tofu, salmon and leafy greens are all good sources of calcium.
Other foods  naturally rich in vitamin D  include seafood, egg yolks, and certain types of mushrooms.
Some people experience more hot flashes when they eat spicy foods,  alcohol , and caffeine.
As such, one strategy the next time you experience hot flashes is to write down what you last ate. Doing so may help you identify trigger foods that you should limit or avoid to reduce how often or intensely you experience hot flashes.
Keeping a more robust  food journal  may also help.
Omega-3-rich foods  include fatty fish like  salmon , sardines, tuna, and mackerel, as well as walnuts, chia, and flax seeds. Notably, these foods may bolster heart health.
Declining levels of estrogen and other sex hormones alter how your body metabolizes carbs and fats during menopause, which may contribute to weight gain.
Phytoestrogens  are plant compounds naturally found in some foods that may act as a weak estrogen in your body. In turn, they may help diminish the symptoms brought on by the decline in estrogen that accompanies menopause.
Foods rich in phytoestrogens  include soybeans, tofu, tempeh, grapes, beans, flaxseeds, linseed, sesame, and black and green tea. Soy is often controversial and frequently misunderstood; this  2021 study  found a benefit from a plant-based diet (that includes whole soy beans) during menopause.

Staying active during menopause
It’s vital to stay active when you’re going through menopause.
That’s because bone density declines during this phase, making you more susceptible to fractures. Yet,  exercise  may counteract bone density loss while boosting your mood, reducing anxiety, and improving sleep.
Weight-bearing exercises help keep your bones strong.
Low impact movement like walking, swimming, dance, and yoga helps keep your joints healthy. These activities may be particularly suitable if you’re new to exercise or haven’t worked out in a while.

The bottom line
Menopause  is a natural transition in a person’s life.
Although the end of menstruation is accompanied by several uncomfortable symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, depression, and weakening bones,  adequate nutrition  and physical activity may diminish the severity of these symptoms.
Eating enough protein and other whole foods like fruits, grains, vegetables, and healthy fats is key. Furthermore, regular exercise supports your mood, bone health, and lean muscle mass.
Be sure to speak with your doctor before making any major changes to your diet or fitness routine.
