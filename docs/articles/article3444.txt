Health benefits of durian
All parts of the durian plant — leaves, husk, roots, and fruit — have been used in traditional Malaysian medicine to treat various illnesses, including high fever, jaundice, and skin conditions ( 2 ).
Studies suggest that durian fruit offers the following health benefits ( 2 ,  3 ):
Reduces cancer risk.  Its antioxidants may neutralize cancer-promoting free radicals. In one test-tube study, durian extract prevented a strain of breast cancer cells from spreading.
Prevents heart disease.  Several compounds in durian may help reduce  cholesterol levels  and your risk of atherosclerosis, or the hardening of your arteries.
Fights infection.  The rind contains compounds that have antibacterial and anti-yeast properties.
Lowers blood sugar.  Durian has a lower glycemic index (GI) than many other tropical fruits, meaning it may  spike blood sugar  levels less.
While these studies show promise, many have been done on animals or in test tubes. No solid claims can be made until the health benefits of durian have been confirmed by controlled studies in people.
Durian contains nutrients and plant compounds that may offer several health benefits, including for cancer, heart health, infections, and blood sugar control. However, no human studies have been conducted.

Potentially harmful in combination with alcohol
Consuming durian at the same time as  alcohol  can cause problems ( 2 ).
Scientists believe that sulfur-like compounds in durian may prevent certain enzymes from breaking down alcohol, causing increased alcohol levels in your blood.
This could lead to symptoms like  nausea , vomiting, and heart palpitations ( 2 ).

Durian contains compounds that may prevent alcohol from being fully metabolized, causing symptoms like nausea and vomiting.

How to eat durian
Opening a durian’s hard, spiky shell often requires gloves or mitts to protect your hands.
You need to cut the shell with a knife and pry it open with your hands before gently removing the durian flesh.
You can then eat it fresh on its own, paired with sticky  rice , or as an ingredient in various dishes.
You can find tutorials on how to open a durian fruit, as well as many recipes, online.
The flesh is also sold  frozen , which slightly changes its texture, making it looser and more stringy.
Durian is also used in prepared foods, such as candy. Yet, while this may give you a sample of its flavor, it won’t provide you with the health benefits.
You can buy fresh or frozen durian and eat it directly or combined with other ingredients in recipes.

Why does it smell so strongly?
Opinions are mixed about durian’s smell. Some people love it, while others hate it.
The smell is very strong and has been described as a combination of sulfur, sewage, fruit, honey, and roasted and rotting  onions .
A study on the aromatic compounds in durian found 44 active compounds, including some that contribute to scents of skunk, caramel, rotten egg, fruit, and soup seasoning ( 4 ).
The fruit’s smell is so potent that it’s banned in many hotels and public transport systems in Southeast Asia.
Your impression of the fruit depends on whether you smell the sweet-smelling or pungent compounds more strongly.
