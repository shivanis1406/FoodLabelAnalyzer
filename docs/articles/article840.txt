Title: Does Sparkling Water Hydrate You?

Sparkling water hydrates you just as much as regular water. But make sure to avoid any sparkling water with added sugar and other sweeteners.
To stay hydrated, a popular rule of thumb is to drink at least eight 8-ounce (240-mL) glasses of water per day.
However, you may wonder whether sparkling water can count toward that goal due to its acidity.
This article tells you whether sparkling water is hydrating.

Sparkling water vs. regular water
The main ingredients in carbonated water — commonly known as sparkling or seltzer water — are water and carbon dioxide ( 1 ).
Yet, some types have added flavorings and minerals like sodium bicarbonate, potassium sulfate, and sodium chloride. The  most common types of carbonated water  are ( 1 ):
Sparkling or seltzer water.  This type is tap water that’s been filtrated and artificially carbonated.
Mineral water.  The gas in this one occurs naturally, but it may be fortified with additional carbon dioxide — either artificially or from the same source as the water.
Soda water.  Aside from the carbon dioxide, this water contains sodium bicarbonate and possibly other compounds to regulate its acidity.
Tonic water.  This carbonated and mineralized water also has  quinine , which gives it a bitter taste that’s often masked by sweeteners and flavorings.
When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, its pH drops, resulting in a slightly acidic beverage. The final product is fizzy, which may make it more appealing than regular water for many people.
Sparkling water is infused with carbon dioxide, which makes it bubbly and gives it a slightly acidic pH.

Sparkling water is hydrating
Sparkling water is effective at keeping your body hydrated.
Staying hydrated is essential, as  dehydration  may lead to impaired brain function, mood swings, and — over time — the development of chronic diseases ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
One study investigated the hydrating effect of 13 drinks, including sparkling water, by establishing each drink’s beverage hydration index (BHI). The BHI evaluates the volume of urine produced by any drink compared with still water ( 5 ).
The study concluded that sparkling water was as hydrating as still water ( 5 ).
Furthermore, it determined that drinks with a higher mineral content tended to be more hydrating. While some sparking waters may have more sodium than regular water, the sodium content of regular water can vary widely based on geographical location ( 6 ,  7 ,  8 ).
An older study likewise found no significant differences in hydration levels after people drank various beverages, including plain and carbonated water ( 9 ).
Therefore, sparkling water contributes to your  daily water intake . According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), men should get 125 ounces (3.7 liters) of total water per day and women 91 ounces (2.7 liters), which includes water from food ( 10 ).
Sparkling water is as hydrating as regular water, so drinking it may help you reach your daily water goals.

Is it better than still water?
When choosing between sparkling and still water, it’s best to select the one that helps you  drink more water  during the day.
If you find the fizz from the carbon dioxide appealing, this may boost your daily water intake.
However, studies suggest that the effervescence of sparkling water strongly enhances its ability to curb thirst, which may lead to people drinking less water ( 1 ,  11 ).
However, others may feel that carbonation positively affects how much water they drink.
If you’re prone to  bloating , consider avoiding sparkling water and other carbonated drinks, as they may worsen this condition ( 12 ).
Still, both types of water are equally hydrating, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) even promotes sparkling water for those who find plain water unappealing ( 13 ).

Just be sure to read the nutrition label on your sparkling water and avoid those with added sugars, as sugar-sweetened varieties are linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes ( 14 ,  15 ).
You should opt for the type of water that helps you increase your daily water intake. Some people may find sparkling water more appealing because of its carbonation.

The bottom line
Sparkling water  hydrates you just as much as regular water. Thus, it contributes to your daily water intake.
In fact, its fizziness may even enhance its  hydrating effects  for some people.
Nonetheless, you should choose sparkling water without added sugar or other sweeteners.
