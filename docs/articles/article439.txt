Title: The 8 Best Juices for Weight Loss

Consuming 100% fruit or vegetable juice can be beneficial for weight loss and overall health. Try juicing a variety of greens, other vegetables, or fruit to add in some extra nutrients.
In general, experts suggest consuming whole fruits and vegetables instead of juices, which only provide water content, vitamins, and minerals.
But juices can be a quick and convenient way to squeeze some extra nutrients into your diet and promote weight loss, though weight loss is best achieved through water consumption and an increased intake of fruits and veggies.
However, some types of juice are high in sugar and low in fiber, which can increase calorie intake and even lead to weight gain over time.
This is especially true of store-bought juices, which are often laden with sugar, artificial flavors, and preservatives and aren’t 100% juice.
And those with diabetes need to be especially wary of drinking excess juices since they are a simple carbohydrate that can spike your blood sugar easily.
Alternatively, you can use a blender. This method is preferable because it retains a higher amount of fiber, which can help promote feelings of fullness and manage your hunger.
Here are 8 of the best juices for weight loss.

1. Celery juice
Celery juice  has recently become a popular ingredient among health-conscious consumers.
It is not only low in calories (1 cup contains 33 calories) but also comprises more than  95% water .
A  2023 review  of older studies shows that choosing foods and beverages with a  lower calorie density,  like vegetables, and following a plant-based diet could be beneficial for weight loss and fat loss.
Celery juice is also a great source of antioxidants and beneficial plant compounds, which can help  reduce oxidative stress  and fight inflammation.

2. Beet juice
Athletes often consume  beet juice  when they’re looking to boost their performance. That’s because this juice contains beneficial compounds like dietary nitrates.
A  systematic review  from 2023 found that frequent and consistent supplementation with beetroot juice, along with other supplements, can positively affect athletic performance, particularly when doing high intensity exercise.
Supplementation with beetroot juice is also often  recommended  for ultra-endurance athletes.
According to a  2021 research review , dietary nitrates can help:
increase muscle efficiency
increase endurance
reduce blood pressure by dilating the blood vessels
support heart and brain health
enhance skeletal muscle functioning
Meanwhile,  whole, raw beets  are low in calories and loaded with fiber. A  high fiber diet  can help:
support regularity
slow stomach emptying
keep you feeling fuller for longer to promote weight management
As most of the fiber content in beets is eliminated during the juicing process, beet juice generally doesn’t contain high amounts of this nutrient. That said, it’s a lower-calorie and  nutritious juice option  if you’re looking to lose weight.

3. Pomegranate juice
In addition to being delicious and refreshing,  100% pomegranate juice  is a healthy drink that may support weight loss.
A  2023 systematic review  found that pomegranate juice may be beneficial for weight loss, particularly due to its high antioxidant activity and polyphenol content. Polyphenols have been linked to appetite-suppressing effects.
These factors together give pomegranate juice:
anti-obesity effects
anti-inflammatory effects
anticancer effects
Some  research  also suggests that whole  pomegranates  may help with type 2 diabetes treatment and prevent  blood sugar spikes and crashes , which can otherwise lead to increased feelings of hunger.

4. Green veggie juice
Although the exact ingredients of  green juices  can vary, most feature leafy green vegetables like:
kale
spinach
cabbage
These ingredients are high in fiber, low in sugar, and jam-packed with anti-inflammatory antioxidants.
Interestingly,  studies  show that increasing your intake of whole fruits and vegetables may be linked to decreased body weight and a reduced risk of weight gain and fat gain over time.
Additional  studies  of whole fruit and vegetable intake for only women have found similar results on weight loss.
Plus, green juices are easy to tailor to your taste buds by swapping in your favorite ingredients. For a simple green juice you can make at home, try blending spinach, cucumber, green apples, and celery — then enjoy.
By using a blender instead of a juicer, you get the added benefit of all the nutrients and fiber from the leafy greens, making it even more satiating and weight loss-friendly.

5. Watermelon juice
Watermelon  juice is sweet, refreshing, and highly nutritious.
Besides being low in calories,  watermelon  is a great source of heart-healthy micronutrients like potassium and the immune-supporting antioxidants vitamins A and C.
It also boasts a high water content, which could help you lose weight and feel fuller.
In a small, 4-week  study  involving 33 people, researchers gave participants 2 cups (300 grams [g]) of fresh, whole watermelon daily. Compared with those in a control group, participants experienced significant reductions in the following:
body weight
belly fat
hunger
food cravings

6. Lemon-ginger green juice
Lemon-ginger green juice can be a vibrant and delicious addition to a balanced weight loss diet.
In particular,  lemons  can help add a zip of flavor to your drink while squeezing in some  extra antioxidants .
Some studies in humans and animals also show that  ginger  could help:
boost metabolism
reduce appetite
promote weight loss
Like pomegranate juice, ginger also has an impressive antioxidant profile that has therapeutic and several  protective effects , such as:
anticancer
anti-diabetic
anti-ulcer
And like spinach or kale — when blended rather than juiced— ginger can boost your  fiber intake  and keep you feeling full between meals.
To get started, simply add a small knob of peeled ginger, some freshly squeezed lemon juice, and 1 cup (30 g) of raw spinach to your food processor and blend.

7. Carrot juice
A beverage of  100% carrot juice  is a nutrient-dense option packing plenty of vitamin A and other healthy carotenoids into each serving.
Blending  raw carrots  instead of juicing them can also  help :
boost your fiber intake
enhance feelings of fullness
regulate your appetite
Plus, carrots are rich in  carotenoids , a type of plant pigment found in many fruits and vegetables.
Interestingly, an 8-week  study  in 2020 including 28 men with obesity found that those who drank a beverage rich in carotenoids daily experienced significant reductions in belly fat.

8. Kale-apple juice
Kale apple juice can be a healthy, high fiber alternative to sugary, store-bought fruit juices.
Studies have shown health effects of kale  include :
anti-inflammatory
antiviral
anti-depressant
blood pressure-lowering
heart-protective
anticancer
free radical-fighting
Apples  are also high in fiber and a host of other nutrients.  Research  has found that consuming them whole with the peel is associated with:
anti-inflammatory properties
supporting beneficial gut bacteria
micronutrient absorption
Apple seeds  may cause intestinal discomfort when consumed in excess. But blending a whole apple with seeds into your juice in moderation may offer anticancer properties.
To make a kale-apple blended drink at home, simply blend a handful of kale leaves with a few sliced apples.
You can dial up the flavor and health benefits even further by adding other ingredients like celery, lemon juice, ginger, or carrots.

The takeaway
Many healthy and delicious juices can support long-term weight loss if they’re 100% juice and not the artificially sweetened or flavored juices you find in-store.
Ideal juices for weight loss are low in sugar, high in fiber, and rich in other important nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. You get more fiber if you choose to blend your fruits and vegetables instead of juicing them, too.
You can use this list as a starting point and experiment with your favorite ingredients to create healthy juices at home using a juicer or blender.
