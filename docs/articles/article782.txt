Title: What Makes You Gain Belly Fat?

Different factors, such as a sedentary lifestyle, hormones, and the foods you eat, may increase your abdominal fat.
Getting rid of excess belly fat, or abdominal fat, is a common goal for many.
Maintaining a moderate body weight and body fat percentage is important for good health, but the type of belly fat you store may also influence your health.
There are  two main types  of fat:
Subcutaneous fat  is the layer of fat that sits directly under the skin all over the body. You can feel it when pinching the skin, and it comprises around 85% of your total fat mass.
Visceral fat  surrounds your liver and other abdominal organs. It comprises around 10% of your total fat mass, but high levels are linked with chronic conditions like metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and heart disease.
Many people in the health industry claim that you can directly target the belly for fat loss, a technique known as spot reduction.
However, research suggests that spot reduction isn’t effective. Instead, focusing on general fat loss could help you lose stubborn belly fat.
Everyone also experiences weight and fat gain differently. Some may notice initial signs of weight gain in their abdominal area, while others may notice it first in their arms, thighs, or faces.
Keep reading to learn more about factors that may contribute to the development of excess belly fat.
The most important factor in weight management is energy balance, which refers to the daily number of calories you consume compared with those you burn, or expend.
Calorie intake versus expenditure can be classified into three terms:
Calorie balance:  Consuming the same number of daily calories as you burn leads to  weight maintenance , which is when your weight remains stable, or the same.
Calorie surplus:  This is when you consume more calories than you burn, which may  increase  fat mass and body weight.
Calorie deficit:  This is when you consume  fewer calories  than you burn. Over time, this may lead to weight and fat loss.
Several factors may influence your energy balance, such as your level of physical activity, the types of food you eat, and your levels of stress, among others.

Diet
Diet plays a key role in managing body weight and overall body fat.
According to the United Kingdom’s  National Health Service (NHS) , the following dietary factors and habits may contribute to overall weight gain and conditions like  obesity :
eating  large portions
eating  ultra-processed  and fast foods, notably those high in  added sugars  and fats
“comfort” eating , such as when you’re stressed or anxious
drinking  alcohol  and  sugar-sweetened beverages
The nutritional composition of your food may also contribute to weight management.  Macronutrients  include protein, carbohydrates, and fat, which are essential nutrients your body needs to function.
Research  suggests that eating a high protein diet helps reduce hunger, promote feelings of fullness, and boost  basal metabolic rate  — all factors that influence calorie intake.
Similarly, the type of carbs you eat may have an impact on weight and belly fat.
For instance, a  2023 study  found that refined carbs, starchy vegetables, and added sugars from sugar-sweetened beverages were associated with weight gain over time. A  high fiber diet  with whole grain, non-starchy vegetables, and fruit was associated with better weight management.
Lastly, eating a diet high in  saturated  and  trans  fats may  contribute  to overall weight gain and chronic conditions  like  heart disease and stroke.
Instead, try replacing these foods with foods high in  unsaturated fats , which may  improve  body composition, overall body weight, and energy expenditure.
There’s no “one-size-fits-all” diet for belly fat, as this will depend on many individual factors.
Eating a well-balanced diet and staying within your total calorie goals may help you manage your weight. According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , this may consist of:
eating  whole grains ,  fruits ,  vegetables ,  lean proteins , and  low fat dairy  products
limiting  sodium , added sugars,  cholesterol ,  alcohol , saturated and trans fats
If you’re not sure where to begin, consider speaking with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian. They could help develop an eating plan for you.

Distracted eating
Distracted eating may include eating while talking on the phone, commuting, or watching TV.
Research  suggests that distracted eating patterns are associated with weight gain and increased belly fat.
Distracted eating may cause you to consume more calories, resulting in a calorie surplus.
For instance, it may reduce your ability to taste and smell food, affecting your satiety signals and causing you to eat more. It can also lead to consuming food soon after eating, adding more to your total calories.

Sedentary lifestyle and physical inactivity
Physical inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle are  associated  with increases in weight gain, which may include body fat.
Sedentary behaviors involve prolonged periods of inactivity, such as sitting or lying down.
The  Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans  recommend that adults get at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate intensity  aerobic exercise  weekly or 75 to 150 minutes of high intensity exercise, along with 2 days per week of  resistance training .
However, it’s estimated that up to  8 out of 10 adults  in the United States don’t meet these recommended aerobic and resistance training recommendations.
Engaging in regular physical activity and limiting sitting during the day may lower your risk of increased abdominal fat. What’s more, c ombining regular physical activity with a well-balanced diet may be the  best  way  to support weight management.
If sitting is part of your work, try to incorporate “standing breaks” every 30 to 90 minutes by standing for 5 to 10 minutes or taking a quick walk around your office, home, or neighborhood.

Menopause
Gaining belly fat during menopause is  extremely common .
During menopause, estrogen levels drop dramatically.  Research  suggests that menopause may cause increases in  visceral fat  and fat to be stored in the abdomen rather than on the hips and thighs.
While menopause is a natural part of the aging process, interventions like  estrogen therapy  may lower your risk of abdominal fat storage and its associated health risks.
If you have concerns, speak with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian.

Gut bacteria imbalance
Gut bacteria are collectively known as your gut flora or microbiome.
Some  research  suggests that having an unhealthy balance of gut bacteria may affect weight and visceral fat, but the exact relationship requires more research.
Changes in  bacteria diversity  may also affect energy expenditure, nutrient metabolism, inflammation, and hormone regulation, possibly leading to weight gain.
A  2021 review  found that 14 out of 23 studies determined that taking  probiotic supplements  helped reduce visceral fat,  waist-to-hip ratio , and overall body weight.
However, it’s important to note that not all studies found the same results. As such, more research is needed to assess the relationship between belly fat and gut health.

Stress and cortisol
Cortisol is a hormone that’s essential for survival.
It’s produced by the adrenal glands and is known as a “ stress hormone ” because it helps your body respond to a physical or psychological threat or stressor.
Chronic stress may increase your cortisol levels. This may increase your desire to choose high calorie foods for comfort, which may lead to a calorie surplus and the  accumulation  of visceral fat.
A  2018 review  found that chronic stress may also contribute to overall weight gain and obesity by:
reducing sleep quality
increasing hunger hormones and food cravings
decreasing motivation for physical activity
Consider managing your stress through health-promoting lifestyle behaviors, such as exercising, meditating, and writing in a journal.

Genetics
Genes play a  major role  in the risk of developing obesity.
Similarly,  research  suggests that some people are more likely to store fat in the abdomen versus other body parts, which is partly influenced by genetics.
Researchers have also identified over  10 different genes  that may play a role in obesity.
For example, certain genes may influence the release and action of leptin, a hormone responsible for appetite regulation and weight management.
While promising, more research needs to be conducted in this area.

Not enough sleep
Research has linked inadequate sleep, like  short sleep duration , with weight gain, which may include abdominal fat.
Not getting enough sleep may contribute to belly fat and overall weight gain in several ways,  such as :
eating more frequently during the day and at night
choosing foods higher in calories, added sugars, and saturated fat
eating less whole foods, such as fruits and vegetables
experiencing hormonal changes that stimulate appetite
Health organizations recommend that adults get  7 to 9 hours  of sleep.
If you have trouble sleeping, consider speaking with a healthcare professional. They could help develop a sleeping plan for you.

The bottom line
Many different factors can increase the likelihood of gaining excess belly fat.
There are a few that you can’t do much about, like your genes and natural hormone changes at menopause.
However, you may be able to make health-promoting choices about diet, exercise, and stress management, which could all contribute to managing belly fat.
