Title: Nutritional Facts and Benefits of Bell Peppers

Bell peppers (Capsicum annuum) are fruits that belong to the nightshade family. They are low in calories and rich in vitamin C and other antioxidants, making them an excellent addition to a healthy diet.
Bell peppers are related to chili peppers, tomatoes, and breadfruit, all of which are native to Central and South America. Also called sweet peppers or capsicums, bell peppers can be eaten raw or cooked.
Bell peppers are sometimes dried and powdered. They are referred to as paprika.
Bell peppers come in various colors, such as:
red
yellow
orange
green (unripe)
Green, unripe peppers have a slightly bitter flavor and are less sweet than fully ripe ones.

Nutrition facts
Fresh, raw bell peppers are mainly composed of water (92%). The rest is carbs and small amounts of protein and fat.
The main nutrients in  3.5 ounces (100 grams)  of raw red bell peppers are:
Calories:  26
Water:  92%
Protein:  1 gram
Carbs:  6 grams

Bell peppers are primarily composed of  carbohydrates , which account for most of their calorie content. A 3.5-ounce (100 grams) serving contains 6 grams of carbs.
The carbs are mostly sugars, such as glucose and fructose, which are responsible for the sweet taste of ripe bell peppers.
They provide a decent amount of  fiber  for a low calorie food.

Vitamins and minerals
Bell peppers contain various  vitamins and minerals , including:
Vitamin C:  One medium-sized red bell pepper provides 169% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for  vitamin C , making it one of the richest dietary sources of this essential nutrient.
Vitamin B6:  Pyridoxine is the most common type of vitamin B6, a family of nutrients important for forming red blood cells.
Vitamin K1:  A form of vitamin K, also known as phylloquinone, K1 is important for blood clotting and bone health.
Potassium:  This essential mineral  may improve  heart health.
Folate ,  also known as vitamin B9, has a variety of functions in the  body. Adequate  folate  intake is  very important  during pregnancy.
Vitamin E:  A powerful antioxidant,  vitamin E  is essential for healthy nerves and muscles. The best dietary sources of this fat-soluble vitamin include oils, nuts, seeds, and vegetables.
Vitamin A:  Red bell peppers are  high in  pro-vitamin A (beta carotene), which your body converts into vitamin A.

Other plant compounds
Bell peppers are rich in various  antioxidants , especially carotenoids, which are much more abundant in ripe specimens.
The main compounds in bell peppers  include :
Capsanthin:  Especially high in red bell peppers, capsanthin is a powerful antioxidant  responsible for  their brilliant red color.
Violaxanthin:  This is a carotenoid responsible for the orange color in orange and yellow bell peppers.
Lutein:   Lutein  is  abundant  in green (unripe) bell peppers and yellow and orange bell peppers. Adequate lutein intake  may improve  eye health.
Quercetin:  Research indicates that this polyphenol antioxidant  may be beneficial  for preventing certain chronic conditions, such as heart disease and cancer.
Luteolin:  Similarly to quercetin, luteolin is a polyphenol antioxidant that  may have  various beneficial health effects.

Health benefits of bell peppers
Like most whole plant foods, bell peppers are considered a  nutritious food .
High consumption of  fruits  and vegetables  has been linked  to a reduced risk of many chronic illnesses, such as cancer and heart disease.
Regularly eating bell peppers as part of a nutrient-rich diet may have other health benefits, including:
The most common visual impairments include  macular degeneration  and  cataracts , which are mainly caused by aging and infections. However,  nutrition  may also play a significant role in eye health.
Lutein and zeaxanthin, carotenoids found in relatively high amounts in bell peppers,  may improve  eye health when consumed in adequate amounts. They may protect your retina, the light-sensitive inner wall of your eye, from oxidative damage.
Regularly consuming foods rich in these carotenoids may cut the risk of both cataracts and macular degeneration, which can cause visual impairment.
Bell peppers are  high  in vitamin C.
Getting enough vitamin C in your diet can support your overall immune health and  may have  a protective role in:
maintaining  cardiovascular health
preventing and supporting treatment for cancer
preventing and  shortening the duration of the common cold
Too much vitamin C in your diet can lead to  kidney stones .

Adverse effects
Bell peppers are generally healthy and well-tolerated, but some people may be allergic to them. That said, an  allergy  to bell peppers and other  nightshades  is not common.
Still, some people with an allergy to pollen, particularly mugwort pollen, may also be sensitive to bell peppers due to allergic cross-reactivity, or  oral allergy syndrome .
Allergic cross-reactions can happen between certain foods because they may contain the same allergens or allergens similar in chemical structure.

The bottom line
Bell peppers are rich in vitamins and antioxidants, especially vitamin C and carotenoids.
For this reason, they may have several health benefits, such as improved eye health and reduced risk of several chronic diseases.
Bell peppers are a nutritious addition to a  balanced diet .
