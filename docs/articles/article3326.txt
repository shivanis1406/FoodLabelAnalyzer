Title: 63 Low Carb Foods That Taste Incredible

Meat, eggs, and seafood are low in carbs. You can also eat certain vegetables, including broccoli and eggplant, as well as fruit, such as avocado and apricots, on a low carb diet.
Many people follow a low carbohydrate diet to lose weight, lower blood sugar levels, or treat certain diseases. It may be challenging for people who are just starting out to prepare nutritious low carb meals. But eating low carb doesn’t have to be complicated. There are plenty of low carb foods to choose from that promote health and overall well-being.
Here are 63 low carb foods, most of which are healthy, nutritious, and delicious.

Total carbs vs. net carbs
When it comes to the  low carb community , there is an ongoing debate about whether to consider net carbs or total carbs.
Net carbs  refers to the amount of carbohydrates that your body  actually absorbs . If you want to calculate them in whole foods, you need to subtract the fiber content from the total number of carbs.
For processed foods, you also need to subtract a portion of  sugar alcohols .
It’s important to note that some natural foods such as oils and fats contain no carbs at all, resulting in 0 net carbs when consumed.

1–8: Animal proteins
Animal protein has close to zero carbs.  Organ meats , such as raw beef liver, which contains about  4%  carbs, are an exception.
Examples of animal protein include:
eggs
beef
lamb
chicken
pork , including bacon
jerky
turkey
veal
Note that  bacon  and jerky are processed meats, so some bacon products may contain additional ingredients that raise their carbohydrate content. It’s important to check the nutritional content of any bacon products before adding them to your diet.

9–17: Seafood
Fish and other seafood tend to provide incredibly  nutritious and healthy benefits .
They’re particularly high in B12, iodine, and  omega-3 fatty acids  — all nutrients many people do not get enough.
Like meat, almost all types of fish and seafood contain next to no carbs. They include:
salmon
trout
sardines
shellfish like oysters and mussels
shrimp
crab
lobster
tuna
cod

18–34: Vegetables
Most vegetables are low in carbs. Leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables have particularly low levels, and most of their carbs consist of fiber.
On the other hand, starchy root vegetables like potatoes and sweet potatoes are high in carbs.
The following vegetables have about 3–9 grams (g) of carbs per 100 g in their raw, unprocessed forms.
broccoli
tomatoes
onions
brussels sprouts
cauliflower
kale
eggplant
cucumber
bell peppers
asparagus
green beans
white mushrooms
celery
spinach
zucchini
Swiss chard
cabbage

35–44: Fruits
While many fruits are rich in nutrients, people following a low carb eating plan find them  highly controversial  when it comes to deciding whether they’re acceptable dietary options.
That’s because most fruits are high in carbs compared to vegetables.
Depending on how many carbs you aim for, you may want to restrict your fruit intake to 1–2 pieces per day.
However, this does not apply to fatty fruits like avocados or olives. Low sugar berries, such as strawberries, are another excellent choice.
The following fruits have about 6–15 g of carbs per 100 g in their raw forms.
avocado
black olives
strawberries
grapefruit
apricots
lemons
kiwis
oranges
mulberries
raspberries

46–51: Nuts and seeds
Nuts and seeds are very popular on low carb diets. Some are low in carbs but high in fat, fiber, protein, and various micronutrients.
Nuts are often eaten as snacks, while seeds can add crunch to salads or recipes. The following options contain 10–17 g of carbs per 100 g. Other options may contain more so make sure to check the food label before you purchase an item.
walnuts
peanuts
dried chia seeds
hazelnuts
macadamia nuts
coconut meat
pumpkin and squash seeds

52–55: Dairy
If you tolerate dairy, full fat  dairy products  are excellent low carb foods.
The following options contain about 2–11 g of carbs per 100 g. Nonetheless, be sure to read the label and avoid anything with added sugar.
cheddar cheese
heavy cream
full fat yogurt, plain
Greek yogurt, plain

56–58: Fats and oils
Fats and oils  do not  contain any carbs  and, as such, are acceptable on a low carb, real-food-based diet.
These include:
butter
extra virgin olive oil
avocado oil

59–61: Beverages
Most sugar-free beverages are acceptable on a low carb diet. Keep in mind that fruit juices are very high in sugar and carbs. It’s important that people wishing to limit carbs be mindful of this.
The safest beverages to drink are water, coffee, and tea because they contain no carbs. You can also drink carbonated water if it’s sugar-free.

62–63: Other foods
Lastly, some foods do not quite fit any other category.
Dark chocolate  contains  13 g of carbs  per 1-ounce piece or 46 g per 100 g. Choose real dark chocolate with at least 70–85% cocoa content. This ensures that it doesn’t contain much sugar.
Be careful of condiments like ketchup, BBQ sauce, sweet relish, or honey mustard. These usually have added sugar, so consume them in moderation. Look at their nutrition labels and select condiments with no sugar, such as plain mustard, for example.
That said, there is an almost endless variety of delicious herbs and spices that you can use to add flavor to your food. Most of them are very low in carbs but pack a powerful nutritional punch while adding flavor to your meals.
Some notable examples include salt, pepper, garlic, ginger, cinnamon, mustard, and oregano.
