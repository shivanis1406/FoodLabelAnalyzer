What Is Jackfruit?
Jackfruit is an exotic fruit grown in tropical regions of the world. It is native to South India.
It is part of the Moraceae plant family, which also includes fig, mulberry and breadfruit. Jackfruit has a spiky outer skin and is green or yellow in color.
One unique aspect of jackfruit is its unusually large size. It is the largest tree fruit in the world and can reach up to 80 pounds (35 kg) in weight.
Jackfruit has a subtle sweet and fruity flavor. It has been said to taste similar to a combination of fruits, including apples, pineapples, mangoes and bananas.
Vegans and vegetarians  often use this fruit as a meat substitute due to its texture, which is comparable to shredded meat.
Since jackfruit is able to withstand tropical climates, it can be a major source of calories and carbs for people in developing countries who are at risk of starvation ( 1 ,  2 ).
Although jackfruit is grown in tropical areas, it is becoming more widely available in other parts of the world, including the US. It is in season during the summer.
The most commonly consumed part of jackfruit is the flesh, or fruit pods, which are edible both when ripe and unripe. It can be used in sweet and savory dishes, including desserts and curries. The seeds are also safe to eat.
Summary  Jackfruit is an exotic tropical fruit with a subtle sweet flavor that is  consumed in many parts of the world. It can be eaten in a variety of ways.

Jackfruit Is Packed With Nutrients
Jackfruit has an impressive nutrition profile.
It contains a moderate amount of calories, providing 155 in a one-cup (165-gram) serving. Approximately 92% of the calories come from carbs, while the rest come from protein and a small amount of fat ( 3 ).
Furthermore, jackfruit contains some of almost every vitamin and mineral that you need, as well as a decent amount of fiber ( 3 ).
One cup of sliced fruit provides the following nutrients ( 3 ):
Calories:  155
Carbs:  40 grams
Fiber:  3 grams
Protein:  3 grams
Vitamin A:  10% of the RDI
Vitamin C:  18% of the RDI
Riboflavin:  11% of the RDI
Magnesium:  15% of the RDI
Potassium:  14% of the RDI
Copper:  15% of the RDI
Manganese:  16% of the RDI
What makes jackfruit unique from other fruits is its  protein  content. It provides more than 3 grams of protein per cup, compared to 0–1 grams in other similar types of fruit, such as apples and mangoes ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
Jackfruit is also rich in several types of antioxidants, which are likely responsible for the majority of its health benefits ( 6 ).
Summary  Jackfruit is quite healthy. It provides a moderate amount of calories in  addition to lots of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.

It May Benefit Blood Sugar Control
Jackfruit has several properties that may help with blood sugar management.
It has a fairly low glycemic index (GI), which is a measure of how quickly your blood sugar rises after eating a food. This has been attributed to the fiber it provides, which slows digestion and helps  prevent blood sugar spikes  ( 7 ,  8 ).
Diets that include lots of low-GI foods have been shown to be helpful for promoting blood sugar control ( 7 ).
Moreover, jackfruit provides some protein, which may help prevent blood sugar levels from rising too quickly after a meal ( 9 ).
In one study, adults who consumed jackfruit extract were found to have significantly improved blood sugar levels ( 10 ).
Additionally, a study of diabetic mice found that jackfruit leaf extract helped reduce fasting blood sugar levels and provided long-term blood sugar control ( 11 ).
These effects were attributed to jackfruit’s content of flavonoid antioxidants, which are known for their ability to promote balanced blood sugar levels ( 12 ,  13 ).
Although the results from these studies are promising, more studies of people eating fresh jackfruit are necessary to confirm these potential benefits.
Summary  Jackfruit  has a low glycemic index and provides some fiber, protein and antioxidants, all  of which may promote better blood sugar control.

It May Protect Against Disease
Jackfruit is high in a few powerful antioxidants that provide various health benefits, including a reduced risk of several diseases.
Antioxidants protect your cells from oxidative stress and  inflammation , which often result from damage caused by molecules called free radicals ( 14 ).
Here’s an overview of the antioxidants that are most abundant in jackfruit:
Vitamin  C:  Jackfruit contains high amounts of vitamin C, which may  help prevent the inflammation that can lead to chronic diseases like heart  disease and cancer ( 3 ,   15 ).
Carotenoids:  Carotenoids have been shown to help lower inflammation  and reduce the risk of various chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes  and heart disease ( 6 ,   16 ,   17 ,   18 ).
Flavanones:  Flavanones contain anti-inflammatory properties that may  help lower blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels — important  factors in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease ( 13 ,  19 ,   20 ).
Summary  Jackfruit  contains a variety of antioxidants that may be helpful for preventing the  development of several chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes.

Other Potential Health Benefits
Jackfruit is said to have several other health benefits that have not been studied specifically.
Immune  health:  Jackfruit’s content of immune-boosting  vitamins A and C may help prevent illnesses. Eating this fruit is also  claimed to be helpful for reducing the risk of viral infections ( 18 ).
Preventing  skin problems:  This fruit provides several nutrients and  antioxidants, such as  vitamin C , that may improve skin health. There is anecdotal  evidence that eating it may slow the aging of your skin ( 18 ,  21 ).
Heart  health:  Jackfruit may have the potential to reduce the risk of  heart disease due to its content of potassium, fiber and antioxidants ( 18 ).
Furthermore, the roots and extracts have been used in traditional Indian and Sri Lankan medicine to treat several conditions, including asthma, diarrhea and stomach ulcers, but these effects have never been scientifically proven ( 18 ,  21 ).
Although these reported benefits are not supported by scientific evidence, including jackfruit in your diet is certainly worth a try if you want to improve your health.
Summary  There are several potential health benefits of jackfruit that  have been reported anecdotally but have not been proven by scientific evidence.

Risks of Eating Jackfruit
Although safe for most, some people may need to limit or avoid jackfruit. Certain people are  allergic  to it, especially those who are allergic to birch pollen ( 22 ).
Moreover, due to its potential to lower blood sugar levels, individuals with diabetes may need to have their medication dosages changed if they eat this fruit on a regular basis.
Nevertheless, consuming jackfruit has never been reported to cause any serious side effects, and it is safe for most people to eat.
Summary  There are not any major risks associated with eating  jackfruit, with the exception of individuals who are allergic to it.

How to Eat It
Jackfruit is very versatile and can be eaten raw or cooked.
To prepare it, you will first want to slice it in half and remove the yellow fruit pods and seeds from the skin and core. You can do this with a knife or your hands.
It is important to note that the white, fibrous part inside of jackfruit is incredibly sticky, so it may be helpful to wear gloves while handling it.
Jackfruit can be consumed plain or cooked into both sweet and savory dishes, depending on its ripeness. Unripe fruit generally tastes best in savory recipes, while the sweetness of the ripe fruit is great for desserts.
Since it is an exotic fruit, fresh jackfruit can be difficult to come across in grocery stores, especially when it is not in season. However, it is often sold  canned , which is a convenient option.
Vegetarians and vegans often use jackfruit as a meat alternative due to its texture. For example, you can use the fruit as a meat replacement in jackfruit tacos by cooking it and then combining it with vegetables and seasonings.
Additionally, you can incorporate jackfruit into curries or soups. The ripe fruit also tastes great when added to yogurt or oatmeal.
Jackfruit seeds are edible, too. They can be roasted or boiled and then combined with seasonings. You can even use the seeds to make hummus.
Summary  Jackfruit is quite versatile. It can be eaten raw, cooked, ripe or unripe and  tastes great in a variety of sweet and savory dishes.

The Bottom Line
Jackfruit is very good for you for many reasons.
It is high in nutrients and antioxidants and may have a number of health benefits, including improved blood sugar control.
You can easily incorporate jackfruit into your diet by eating it plain or in various dishes. It makes an excellent meat alternative in vegetarian and vegan recipes.
Fresh jackfruit is easiest to find when it’s in season during the summer months, but you can find canned jackfruit in most grocery stores year-round.
Adding jackfruit to your diet is worth a try, as it is quite healthy and a unique food to experiment with.
