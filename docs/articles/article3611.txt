Title: Can Apple Cider Vinegar Help You Lose Weight?

Research showing that apple cider vinegar can help suppress your appetite is lacking, which means that it’s unclear whether consuming it can lead to weight loss. It may have some other health benefits, though having too much can cause side effects.
Apple cider vinegar has been used as a health tonic for thousands of years. Can adding apple cider vinegar to your diet also help you lose weight?
This article explores the link between apple cider vinegar, weight loss, and other potential health benefits. It also provides tips on incorporating apple cider vinegar into your diet.

Does apple cider help you lose weight and body fat?
It isn’t clear that apple cider vinegar can affect weight and body fat, as there’s only one study suggesting this and its findings haven’t been replicated.
The  2018 clinical trial  involved 39 participants on restricted calorie diets. Those who consumed about 2 tablespoons (tbsp), equivalent to 30 milliliters (mL), of apple cider vinegar daily over 12 weeks lost significantly more weight and body fat than the participants who did not consume apple cider vinegar.
According to this study, adding 1 or 2 tbsp of apple cider vinegar to your diet may help you lose weight. It may also reduce your  body fat percentage , help you lose belly fat, and decrease your blood  triglycerides .
However, the participants were all either overweight or living with obesity based on their body mass index (BMI) and knew they were drinking the vinegar. This means there was no comparison between a control and a  placebo  group. The study also did not account for other factors that affect weight loss such as nutrition or exercise.

What is apple cider vinegar?
Apple cider vinegar is  made  in a two-step  fermentation  process.
First,  apples  are cut or crushed and combined with yeast to convert their sugar into alcohol. Second, bacteria are added to ferment the alcohol into acetic acid.
Traditional apple cider vinegar production takes about 1 month, though some manufacturers dramatically accelerate the process so that it takes only a day.
Acetic acid is the main active component of apple cider vinegar.
Also known as ethanoic acid, it is an organic compound with a sour taste and strong odor. The term “acetic” comes from “acetum,” the Latin word for vinegar.
Acetic acid is a  short-chain fatty acid  that dissolves into acetate and hydrogen in your body.
About 5% to 6% of apple cider vinegar consists of acetic acid. It also contains water and trace amounts of other acids, such as  malic acid . One tablespoon, or  15 mL , contains about 3 calories and virtually no carbs.

Does apple cider vinegar increase fullness and reduce calorie intake?
A few studies have suggested that apple cider vinegar may promote fullness, which can decrease  calorie intake . However, the evidence is inconsistent, and more research is needed to back up this claim.
In a  2022 literature review  that looked at seven studies, only 4 out of 6 short-term studies showed that apple cider vinegar  reduced appetite . None of the long-term studies indicated this result.
In addition, those short-term studies that did show an appetite-suppressing effect used vinegar containing at least 24.6 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) acetic acid. There isn’t a guarantee that the vinegar you purchase will have that exact concentration, and there isn’t a guarantee that the effect will be the same at other concentrations.
Additional evidence  suggesting that apple cider vinegar may slow the rate at which food leaves your stomach has also been found to contain a number of different kinds of biases, which indicates the results may not be reliable.
In addition, some people may have a condition that makes apple cider vinegar harmful.
Gastroparesis, or  delayed stomach emptying , is a common complication of type 1 diabetes. Timing insulin with food intake  becomes a challenge  because it is difficult to predict how long it will take for blood sugar to rise after a meal.
Since apple cider vinegar has  been shown  to extend the time food stays in your stomach, taking it with meals could worsen gastroparesis.

Does apple cider have other health benefits?
In addition to promoting weight and  fat loss , apple cider vinegar may have several  other benefits :
Lowers blood sugar and insulin:  When consumed with a high carb meal, apple cider vinegar  has been shown  to significantly  lower blood sugar  and insulin levels after eating.
Improves insulin sensitivity:  Studies suggest that consuming vinegar with a high carb meal  may help improve   insulin sensitivity .
Lowers fasting blood sugar:   Research  has found an association between consuming apple cider vinegar and a significant lowering of fasting blood  glucose  and glycated  hemoglobin .
Decreases cholesterol levels:  A  2021 research review  of nine clinical trials found that apple cider vinegar  reduced total cholesterol  and triglycerides.
Kills harmful bacteria and viruses:   In vitro   research  shows that apple cider vinegar may be a powerful defender against  E. coli  and  S. aureus  bacteria as well as resistant Escherichia coli (rE. coli) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

How do you use apple cider vinegar for weight loss?
There are a few ways to include apple cider vinegar in your diet, though there isn’t enough evidence to suggest consuming it can help you lose weight.
An easy method is to use it with  olive oil  as a  salad  dressing. It is particularly tasty with  leafy greens ,  cucumbers , and tomatoes.
It can also be used for pickling vegetables, or you can simply mix it into water and drink it.
The amount of apple cider vinegar used for weight loss is 1 to 2 tbsp (15 to 30 mL) per day, mixed with water.
It is best to spread this out into 2 to 3 doses throughout the day, and it may be best to drink it before meals.
Taking more than this is not recommended because of  potentially harmful effects  at higher dosages, such as drug interactions or the erosion of tooth  enamel . It’s also best to start off with  1 teaspoon (5 mL ) to see how you tolerate it.
It’s important to mix apple cider vinegar with water. Undiluted vinegar may burn the inside of your mouth and esophagus.
Although taking apple cider vinegar in  tablet form  may seem beneficial, it comes with potentially large risks, including the possibility of a  burn to the esophagus .
