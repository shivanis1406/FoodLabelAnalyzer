Title: How to Lower Your Triglyceride Levels

Having high triglyceride levels can increase your risk of heart disease. Limiting the amount of sugar, carbs, and trans fats you eat, along with regular exercise and other dietary changes, may help decrease your triglyceride levels.
Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood. After you eat, your body converts the calories that you don’t need into triglycerides and stores them in your fat cells to be used for energy later.
While triglycerides are an important energy supply for your body, having too many triglycerides in your blood can increase your risk of heart disease.
About  25.9% of adults  in the United States have elevated blood triglycerides, which is classified as having triglyceride levels over 150 mg/dL.
Having obesity or unmanaged diabetes, regularly drinking alcohol, and following a high calorie diet can all contribute to  high blood triglyceride levels .
You can lower your triglyceride levels through various dietary and lifestyle changes.

Aim for a healthy-for-you weight
Whenever you eat more  calories  than your body needs, it turns those calories into triglycerides and stores them in fat cells.
Working toward a  moderate body weight  by consuming fewer excess calories can be an effective way to lower your blood triglyceride levels.
In fact, research  has shown  that losing even 5–10% of your body weight can  significantly reduce  your triglyceride levels.

Limit your sugar intake
While the American Heart Association recommends consuming no more than 100–150 calories of added sugar per day, one study found that the average American eats  about 308 calories  of added sugar daily.
Added sugar  is commonly found in sweets, soft drinks, and fruit juice.
Extra sugar in your diet may be turned into triglycerides, which can lead to an increase in blood triglyceride levels, along with other  heart disease  risk factors.
A  2020 review  that included data on 6,730 people found that those who consumed  sugar-sweetened beverages  regularly were over 50% more likely to have high triglycerides than those who did not.
Another  study found  that consuming high amounts of added sugar is also associated with higher blood triglyceride levels in children.
Fortunately,  several studies  have shown that low carb diets  can lead  to a decrease in blood triglyceride levels.
Even a slight change, such as replacing sugar-sweetened beverages with water, could decrease triglycerides in some people.

Follow a lower-carb diet
Much like added sugar, extra calories from carbs in your diet are converted into triglycerides and stored in fat cells.
Not surprisingly,  low carb diets  have been  linked to  lower blood triglyceride levels.
A  review of 12  randomized controlled trials found that people following reduced carb diets typically saw a reduction in triglyceride levels at 6, 12, and 24 months.
Across these studies, triglyceride levels decreased the most 6 months after starting a reduced calorie diet.
A  2020 review  compared low fat and low carb diets. Researchers found that 6–12 months after starting their relative diets, those on the low carb diet had greater decreases in triglyceride levels than those on a  low fat diet .

Eat more fiber
Dietary fiber is  found naturally  in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It’s also found in many other plant sources, including nuts, seeds, cereals, and legumes.
Including more fiber in your diet  can slow  the absorption of fat and sugar in your small intestine, helping decrease your triglyceride levels.
According to  one study , including 117 adults with overweight or obesity, eating more dietary fiber was linked to lower triglyceride levels.
Another small study in adolescents found that consuming a high fiber cereal alongside a breakfast high in fat reduced post-meal triglyceride  increases  by 50%.

Exercise regularly
When paired with weight loss,  studies show  that aerobic exercise is especially effective at decreasing triglycerides.
The American Heart Association  recommends  getting at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise 5 days per week through activities like walking, jogging, bicycling, and swimming.
The  benefits of exercise  on triglycerides are most apparent in long-term exercise regimens.  One study  in people with heart disease showed that exercising for 45 minutes 5 times per week led to a significant decline in blood triglycerides.
All exercise helps reduce triglyceride levels. However,  some research  has found that exercising at a higher intensity for a shorter amount of time is more effective than exercising at a moderate intensity for longer periods.

Limit trans fats
Artificial  trans fats  are added to processed foods to increase their shelf life.
Trans fats are commonly found in commercially fried foods and baked goods made with partially hydrogenated oils. They can also be found in small amounts in some animal products.
In recent years, the addition of trans fats to food  has been  banned in the United States.
Due to their inflammatory properties, trans fats  have been  attributed to many health problems, including increased LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels and heart disease.
One review  of 16 studies reported that replacing trans fats with  polyunsaturated fats  in the diet could help reduce triglyceride levels.

Aim to eat fatty fish twice weekly
Fatty  fish  is well known for its benefits on heart health and ability to lower blood triglycerides.
This is mostly due to its content of  omega-3 fatty acids , a type of polyunsaturated fatty acid that is considered essential, meaning you need to get it through your diet.
Both the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the American Heart Association  recommend  eating two servings of fatty fish per week to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.
One 2016 study  showed that eating salmon twice weekly significantly decreased blood triglyceride concentration.
Salmon, herring, sardines, tuna, and mackerel are a few types of fish that are especially high in omega-3 fatty acids.

Increase your intake of unsaturated fats
Studies show  that monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats can reduce blood triglyceride levels, especially when they’re replacing carbs in your diet.
Monounsaturated fats  are found in foods like olive oil, nuts, and avocados.  Polyunsaturated fats  are present in vegetable oils and fatty fish, as well as nuts and seeds such as walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds.
A  2019 review  of 27 studies reported that while olive oil consumption does decrease triglyceride levels, it does so significantly less than other types of plant oil.
One  older study  analyzed the diets of 452 adults in a specific population of Indigenous people in Alaska over the previous 24 hours.
It found that saturated fat intake was associated with increased blood triglycerides, while polyunsaturated fat intake was associated with lower triglyceride levels.
To maximize the triglyceride-lowering benefits of unsaturated fats, pick a heart-healthy fat like  olive oil  and use it to replace other types of fat in your diet, such as trans fats or highly processed vegetable oils.

Establish a regular meal pattern
Insulin resistance  is another factor that can contribute to high blood triglycerides.
After you eat a meal, the cells in your pancreas send a signal to release insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin is then responsible for transporting sugar to your cells to be used for energy.
If you have  too much insulin  in your blood, your body can become resistant to it, making it difficult for your body to use insulin effectively. This can lead to a buildup of both sugar and triglycerides in the blood.
Setting a regular eating pattern can help prevent insulin resistance and high triglycerides. For instance,  research shows  that not eating breakfast can lead to decreased insulin sensitivity.
An American Heart Association  statement suggested  that irregular eating patterns seemed less likely to achieve healthy cardiometabolic levels. They recommended intentional eating at regular times.
However, the evidence is mixed when it comes to  meal frequency .
A  2013 study  demonstrated that eating three meals per day significantly decreased triglycerides compared with eating six meals per day.
However,  multiple other studies  suggest that changes in meal frequency don’t significantly affect triglyceride concentration.
Regardless of how many meals you’re eating daily, eating regular meals can improve insulin sensitivity and lower blood triglyceride levels.

Limit alcohol intake
Alcoholic beverages  are often high in sugar, carbs, and calories. If these calories remain unused, they can be converted into triglycerides and stored in fat cells.
Additionally, alcohol  can increase  the synthesis of large, very low-density lipoproteins in the liver, which carry triglycerides into your system.
Although a variety of factors come into play, some  studies show  that moderate alcohol consumption can increase blood triglycerides by up to 53%, even if your triglyceride levels are normal to begin with.
That said, other research  has linked  light to moderate alcohol consumption to a reduced risk of heart disease while linking binge drinking to an increased risk.

Add soy protein to your diet
Soy is rich in isoflavones, which are a type of plant compound with numerous health benefits. While widely known for its role in lowering LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, soy protein  has been shown  to reduce blood triglyceride levels.
One review  of 46 studies found that regular consumption of soy protein was linked to significantly lower triglyceride levels in postmenopausal women.
Soy protein  can be found in foods like soybeans (edamame), tofu, tempeh, and soy milk.

Eat more tree nuts
Tree  nuts  provide a concentrated dose of fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and unsaturated fats, all of which work together to lower blood triglycerides.
One analysis  of 61 studies showed that each daily serving of tree nuts decreased triglycerides by an average of 2.2 mg/dL (0.06 mmol/L).
Another review  of 49 studies showed that eating tree nuts is associated with a modest decrease in blood triglycerides.
Tree nuts include:
almonds
pecans
walnuts
cashews
pistachios
Brazil nuts
macadamia nuts
However, keep in mind that nuts are high in calories. A single serving of almonds, or about 23 almonds,  contains  around 164 calories, so moderation is key.
Most studies  have found  the greatest health benefits in individuals who consumed 3–7 servings of nuts per week.

Consult with a healthcare professional about natural supplements
Several natural supplements could have the potential to lower blood triglycerides. Always consult a doctor before starting any supplements, as they can interact with other medications.
Note especially that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate supplements in the same way as it regulates pharmaceuticals, and supplement quality can vary widely.
Below are a few of the main supplements that have been studied:
Fish oil : Well known for its potent effects on heart health,  fish oil  is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have  been shown  to decrease triglycerides and several other risk factors for heart disease.
Fenugreek : Though traditionally used to stimulate milk production,  fenugreek  seeds have also  been shown  to be effective at reducing blood triglycerides.
Vitamin D : Research has shown that  vitamin D  supplementation  can help  reduce overall triglyceride levels.
Curcumin :  One review  of seven studies found that supplementing with  curcumin  could cause a significant drop in triglyceride and LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels.

The bottom line
Dietary and lifestyle factors can have a major influence on your triglyceride levels.
Eating healthy, unsaturated fats instead of trans fats, decreasing your intake of carbs and added sugars, and exercising regularly are a few strategies that can help lower your blood triglycerides.
With a few lifestyle modifications, you can decrease your triglycerides and improve your overall health at the same time.
There’s no need to completely change your diet and lifestyle overnight. Try experimenting with a few of the tips listed above and gradually incorporating other strategies into your routine to make more long lasting, sustainable changes that are easier to stick to.
