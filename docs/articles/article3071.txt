Peloton bikes have become a popular piece of exercise equipment among fitness enthusiasts.
In addition to offering many interactive training options, Peloton makes it easy to track several metrics of your performance, including your heart rate.
However, a heart rate monitor is not included with your Peloton bike and must be purchased separately. Peloton makes one available for purchase, but many other heart monitors also work well with the Peloton bike.

Types of heart rate monitors
Several types of heart rate monitors are available. They differ based on how they are worn and used.
Chest straps, which are fitted snug around your chest, are widely considered the most accurate type of heart rate monitor ( 1 ).
However, there are many other types of heart rate monitors to choose from, including wristbands, armbands, and smartwatches.
In addition to measuring your pulse electronically to track your heart rate, some of these devices may monitor other metrics during your workout, such as your cadence or the number of calories you’ve burned.
