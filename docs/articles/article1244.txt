Title: Is Basmati Rice Healthy?

One cup of basmati rice contains just over 200 calories. It’s often better to eat than white rice, which is a refined grain.
Basmati rice is a type of rice common in Indian and South Asian cuisine.
Available in both white and brown varieties, it’s known for its nutty flavor and pleasant aroma.
Still, you may want to know whether this long-grain rice is healthy and how it compares with other kinds of rice.
This article takes a close look at basmati rice, examining its nutrients, health benefits, and any downsides.

Nutrition facts
Although the exact nutrients vary based on the specific type of basmati, each serving is generally high in carbs and calories, as well as  micronutrients  like folate, thiamine, and selenium.
One cup (163 grams) of cooked white basmati rice contains ( 1 ):
Calories:  210
Protein:  4.4 grams
Fat:  0.5 grams
Carbs:  45.6 grams
Fiber:  0.7 grams
Sodium:  399 mg
Folate:  24% of the Daily Value (DV)
Thiamine:  22% of the DV
Selenium:  22% of the DV
Niacin:  15% of the DV
Copper:  12% of the DV
Iron:  11% of the DV
Vitamin B6:  9% of the DV
Zinc:  7% of the DV
Phosphorus:  6% of the DV
Magnesium:  5% of the DV
In comparison, brown basmati rice is slightly higher in calories,  carbs , and fiber. It also provides more magnesium, vitamin E, zinc, potassium, and phosphorus ( 2 ).
Basmati rice is typically high in carbs and micronutrients like thiamine, folate, and selenium.

Potential health benefits
Basmati rice may be associated with several health benefits.
Compared with  other types of rice , basmati is generally lower in arsenic, a heavy metal that can harm your health and potentially increase your risk of diabetes, heart problems, and certain cancers ( 3 ).
Arsenic  tends to accumulate more in rice than in other grains, which can be particularly concerning for those who eat rice on a regular basis ( 4 ).
However, some studies have found that basmati rice from California, India, or Pakistan contains some of the lowest levels of arsenic, compared with other rice varieties ( 5 ).
Furthermore, it should be noted that  brown rice  varieties tend to be higher in arsenic than white rice, as arsenic accumulates in the hard outer bran layer.
White basmati rice is often  enriched , meaning that certain nutrients are added during processing to help boost the nutritional value.
This can make it easier to meet your needs for a variety of important vitamins and minerals.
In particular, rice and other grains are often enriched with  iron  and B vitamins like folic acid, thiamine, and  niacin  ( 6 ).
Brown basmati rice is considered a whole grain, meaning that it contains all three parts of the kernel — the germ, bran, and endosperm.
Whole grains  are associated with multiple health benefits. For instance, an analysis of 45 studies tied whole grain intake to a lower risk of heart disease, cancer, and premature death ( 7 ).
Another review associated regular intake of whole grains, including brown rice, with a lower risk of  type 2 diabetes  ( 8 ).
What’s more, an 8-week study in 80 people found that replacing refined grains with whole grains lowered levels of inflammatory markers ( 9 ).
Basmati is lower in arsenic than other types of rice and often enriched with important vitamins and minerals. Brown basmati is also considered a whole grain.

Potential downsides
Unlike brown basmati, white basmati is a refined grain, meaning that it has been stripped of many valuable nutrients during processing.
Some studies suggest that eating more refined grains can negatively affect  blood sugar control  and may be associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes ( 10 ,  11 ).
What’s more, a study in over 10,000 people linked dietary patterns that included white rice to a higher risk of obesity ( 12 ).
Additionally, a study in 26,006 people associated white rice intake with a higher risk of metabolic syndrome, which is a group of conditions that can increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes ( 13 ).
These effects may be due to white rice’s high number of carbs and low amount of fiber compared with brown rice.
Therefore, while  white basmati rice  can be enjoyed in moderation, brown basmati may be a better overall option for your health.
Refined grains like white basmati rice are associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Thus, they’re best eaten in moderation.

Basmati vs. other types of rice
Basmati rice is comparable to other types of brown or white rice in terms of nutrients.
Although very minute variations may exist in the calorie, carb, protein, and fiber counts between  specific types of rice , it’s not enough to make much of a difference.
That said, basmati typically harbors less arsenic, which may make it a good choice if rice is a staple in your diet ( 5 ).
As a long-grain rice, it’s also longer and slimmer than short-grain varieties.
Its nutty, floral aroma and soft, fluffy texture work well in many Asian and  Indian  dishes. It’s a particularly great choice for rice puddings, pilafs, and side dishes.
Basmati rice is nutritionally similar to other types of rice but boasts less arsenic. Its unique taste, aroma, and texture make it a good match for Asian meals.

The bottom line
Basmati is an aromatic, long-grain rice that’s lower in arsenic than other types of rice. It’s sometimes enriched with important vitamins and minerals.
It’s available in both white and brown varieties.
Whenever possible, you should select brown basmati, as  refined grains  like white rice are associated with several negative health effects.
