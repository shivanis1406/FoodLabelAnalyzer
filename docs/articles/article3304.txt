BOTTOM LINE: The Pollotarian diet emphasizes plant-based foods and poultry and has been linked to potential health benefits, mostly related to cutting out processed foods. It’s a sustainable eating pattern that may help support weight management efforts.

What is a pollotarian diet?
Also known as pollo-vegetarian, the pollotarian diet is considered to be a type of semi-vegetarianism, as some forms of animal meat are allowed.
While the prefix “pollo” literally translates to “chicken” in Spanish, pollotarians generally eat all forms of poultry, including  turkey  and duck.
People who follow this diet don’t eat red meat or pork products. Additionally, some include eggs and dairy products in their diet, while others don’t.
Pollotarians who sometimes eat fish and seafood are considered pesce-pollotarians.
In addition to allowing poultry, the diet emphasizes plant-based foods, such as  whole grains , fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and healthy fats.
As there are no set guidelines regarding the types and amounts of poultry to consume, the nutrient composition of a pollotarian diet can vary greatly by individual.
A pollotarian diet is a type of semi-vegetarianism in which chicken is allowed, but red meat and pork are not. Some pollotarians may also include eggs and dairy in their diet. Those who eat fish and seafood are considered pesce-pollotarians.

Possible health benefits
Given the limited amount of research on the pollotarian diet specifically, its potential health benefits are largely based on the reduction and elimination of red and  processed meats .
The diet may provide benefits similar to those offered by vegetarian diets, as it also emphasizes plant-based foods.
Some studies have associated high intakes of red meat, especially processed red meats, with an increased risk of heart disease ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
In contrast, population-based studies have linked poultry intake to a decreased risk of  heart disease . This relationship may be due to an increased poultry intake resulting in a decreased intake of red meat ( 1 ,  6 ,  7 ).
In a study in 84,136 women, replacing 1 serving of unprocessed red meat per day with poultry was associated with a 19% reduced risk of heart disease ( 1 ).
In addition to being lower in red and processed meats, pollotarian diets are meant to be high in plant foods.
As a result, the diet can be rich in fiber and  antioxidants , which may protect against heart disease by reducing blood pressure and increasing HDL (good) cholesterol ( 8 ).
High intake of red meat, particularly processed red meat, has been associated with an increased risk of certain types of  cancer , including colorectal cancer ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ).
In contrast, regular intake of poultry has not been associated with colon cancer, and vegetarian diets may even help protect against it ( 11 ,  12 ).
An observational study in 492,186 adults found that for every 1,000 calories eaten, a 10-gram increase in poultry intake combined with an equal reduction in red meat was linked to a significant 3–20% decreased risk of several types of cancer ( 13 ).
Therefore, replacing red meat with poultry and more plant-based foods by following a pollotarian diet may reduce your risk of some types of cancer.
Certain types of red meat, especially processed meats, have been associated with an increased risk of  type 2 diabetes  ( 14 ).
In a study in 53,163 healthy adults, replacing processed red meat with poultry, fish, and unprocessed red meat was found to significantly reduce type 2 diabetes risk over the 15-year follow-up period ( 15 ).
Pollotarian diets are also meant to be high in plant foods, which may protect against type 2 diabetes, as these foods are often  high in fiber  and low in saturated fat.
One study in over 60,000 adults found that semi-vegetarians were 1.5% less likely to have type 2 diabetes, compared with non-vegetarians ( 16 ).
A pollotarian diet may also benefit your waistline.
Poultry is generally lower in calories and saturated fat than red meat and pork products, while still being a good source of protein.
Research has shown that a  high-protein diet  can reduce appetite, helping you eat fewer calories throughout the day ( 17 ,  18 ).
Additionally, those who follow vegetarian diets tend to have a lower body mass index (BMI) than non-vegetarians, while primarily plant-based diets, such as a pollotarian diet, have been found to aid weight loss ( 19 ,  20 ,  21 ).
Due to a lower intake of red meat and higher intake of plant-based foods, a pollotarian diet may decrease your risk of chronic conditions like heart disease, some types of cancer, and type 2 diabetes. It may also aid weight loss.

May be good for the environment
A pollotarian diet may benefit the environment.
One study found that producing beef requires 28 times more land and 11 times more irrigation water than producing other livestock. Plus, it produces 5 times more greenhouse gas emissions, on average, compared with other livestock, including poultry and  pork  ( 22 ).
Additionally, plant-based foods are often found to be more sustainable than animal products, as they require fewer resources than raising animals ( 23 ).
Nonetheless, research suggests that reducing your overall intake of animal products and choosing more sustainable options, such as  chicken , can still benefit the environment and may be more realistic for current meat-eaters ( 24 ).
Reducing your intake of red meat and replacing it with more sustainable options, including poultry and plant foods, can be good for the environment by using fewer resources and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.

Potential downsides
A well-planned pollotarian diet that contains a variety of plant-based foods along with moderate poultry intake can be quite healthy and not require any supplementation.
However, as with other vegetarian dietary patterns, some people may be at risk of  nutrient deficiencies  when cutting back on animal products.
Possible nutrient deficiencies to be aware of when following a pollotarian diet include:
iron
zinc
vitamin B12
calcium
omega-3 fatty acids
Iron and zinc are present in plant foods but better absorbed from animal products. While poultry contains both minerals, pollotarians may still need to be conscious of including adequate plant-based sources of iron and zinc ( 25 ).
Vitamin B12 is only found in animal products. Depending on how much poultry a pollotarian chooses to include in their diet, a B12 supplement may be recommended.
For pollotarian diets that don’t include dairy, it’s important to incorporate plant-based sources of  calcium , including kale, white beans, sesame seeds, and whole soy products.
Finally, if fish and seafood are restricted, a pollotarian may not be getting adequate amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential and important for physical and mental health ( 26 ).
Sources of the plant-based form of omega-3 — alpha-linolenic acid — include walnuts, as well as chia and flax seeds.
Pollotarians may be at risk of certain nutritional deficiencies, particularly vitamin B12, calcium, and omega-3s, depending on their food choices.

Foods to eat
A pollotarian diet is ideally high in  plant-based foods  and contains moderate amounts of poultry. Foods that are okay to eat on a pollotarian diet include:
Whole grains and grain products:  quinoa, oats, millet, farro, etc.
Fruits:  apples, grapefruit, bananas, berries, pears, etc.
Vegetables:  broccoli, spinach, squash, potatoes, peppers, etc.
Legumes:  lentils, chickpeas, black beans, kidney beans, etc.
Nuts, nut butters, and seeds:  pumpkin seeds, almond butter, walnuts, etc.
Poultry:  including chicken, turkey, and duck
Plant-based protein:  tofu,  pea protein , seitan, etc.
Healthy fats:  avocados, olive oil, coconut, coconut oil, etc.
Non-dairy products:  almond milk, coconut yogurt, coconut milk, etc.
Pollotarians may also choose to include eggs and dairy products.
A pollotarian diet includes a variety of whole, plant-based foods and moderate intake of poultry. Depending on the individual, eggs and dairy products may also be eaten.

Foods to avoid
Other than poultry, pollotarians don’t eat any other animal meat. While some may include fish and shellfish, they would technically be considered pesce-pollotarians.
Foods to avoid on a pollotarian diet include:
beef
pork
lamb
game meat, such as bison, elk, and venison
fish
shellfish
Additionally, intake of  fried poultry  should be minimized.
All forms of red meat and pork are avoided on a pollotarian diet. While the addition of fish and seafood is technically a pesce-pollotarian diet, some pollotarians may include them.

This five-day meal plan provides meal ideas for following a pollotarian diet. However, the amount of poultry eaten may vary by individual.

The bottom line
A pollotarian diet focuses on whole, plant-based foods with the inclusion of poultry in moderation.
As it’s rich in high-fiber, plant-based foods and reduces red meat and pork intake, it may benefit heart health,  aid weight loss , and protect against type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.
Compared with the average Western diet, it may also be good for the environment.
Overall, a pollotarian diet can be a healthy, more realistic option for meat-eaters who are looking to eat less red meat and more plant-based foods.
