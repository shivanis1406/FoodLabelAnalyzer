Title: 20 Sustainable Ways to Lose Weight in Your 30s

Your body changes over time, but you can do things in your 30s to aid weight loss and promote overall health. Excessively restrictive diets and a negative body image, however, may be counteractive.
Losing weight to reach a moderate weight can improve your  blood sugar  and insulin sensitivity,  blood pressure levels ,  inflammatory markers , and  mobility .
A moderate body weight may improve your  self-confidence ,  body image , and  depressive symptoms .
But many  weight loss methods  are unsustainable. Dieting and diet culture can be incredibly harmful to your physical and mental health.
It’s possible to safely reach a body weight that promotes your overall health.

1 to 7: Changes in mentality
Focusing on improving other aspects of your health rather than your body weight or physical appearance may help you reach your goals.
A  2019 review  studying body image and  physical activity  found that people with positive body images were more likely to engage in physical activity and sports than those with negative body images.
But this does not mean that improving your appearance cannot motivate you. Rather, it suggests that your appearance and desire to be accepted by others should not be the only — or even the main — motivators for reaching a moderate body weight.
Motivational factors like  improving your diet quality , endurance, and  energy levels  and reducing your disease risk may  improve long-term success  on your weight loss journey.
Never compromise your health or happiness by following a diet or  exercise  program that makes you feel bad about yourself.
An extremely  restrictive  diet that causes you to become overly preoccupied with food is a sign that the plan is not right for you and your needs.
The same goes for activity. If a  new trainer  or workout class makes you feel uncomfortable or bad about yourself, find a different activity that you enjoy and have fun doing. And if needed, find a new trainer who makes you feel supported on your weight loss journey.
A sustainable dietary pattern and  activity plan  should leave you feeling healthy, nourished, and energized.
Weight loss is only one piece of a large puzzle.
Stress ,  mental health conditions , lack of activity, illness and disease, diets low in necessary nutrients, genetics, and a  lack of sleep  are  other factors  to consider.
This is why improving your overall health — not just losing weight — can be the best goal to set.
It’s important to consider your future self, although having short-term goals is typical when trying to lose weight.
How can  improving your nutrition , increasing your activity, and managing your body weight during your 30s benefit your future health?
Make decisions based on how they affect your overall health and future well-being rather than making  dietary and lifestyle modifications  based on how quickly they encourage weight loss.
Learning to respect your body at any weight fosters  self-acceptance  and successful weight management. Being hard on yourself will not make you more successful.
Research  shows that self-criticism may undermine or even counteract attempts at weight management and weight loss.
Working with an experienced  therapist  may help if you’re learning to manage self-acceptance and how to show your body kindness regardless of your body weight.
Plateaus  and fluctuations are part of losing weight. Weight loss is complicated and involves compensatory changes in the body that slow weight loss over time and encourage weight regain.
You may need to increase your calorie intake when you hit a plateau, especially if you’ve been following a diet that does not supply your body with an adequate amount of energy.
Slowly increasing your calorie intake may counteract some of the natural metabolic changes that occur during weight loss and make  keeping weight off  difficult.
Setting weight loss goals you can reach without engaging in unsustainable, restrictive diets and extreme workout regimens is essential.
The best overall goal to consider is  improving your health . This can include, but should not be limited to, losing excess body fat.
Understand that your “ goal weight ” might not be possible unless you use health-harming, extreme measures, which are not recommended.
You can work with a qualified healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian, to develop realistic, health-supportive, weight loss and nutrition goals specific to your body and health needs.

8 to 14: Changes to dietary habits
Research  published in 2020 shows that increasing your  fruit and vegetable  intake promotes weight loss and may help maintain a moderate body weight.
Adding  more vegetables  and  fruits  to your diet is an excellent way to:
improve diet quality
decrease disease risk
promote healthy weight loss
To develop a sustainable  weight loss  plan that works for your needs, it’s important to avoid restrictive, unnecessary diets.
Dieting and restrained eating do not work for long-term weight maintenance.
Some of the most  frequently reported strategies  people use for weight loss, per an assessment of global weight control registries, do not involve heavily reorganizing your dietary plan . Instead, they focus on:
having nutritious foods available at home
a regular breakfast intake
increasing vegetable consumption
decreasing sugary and fatty foods
limiting certain foods
reducing fat in meals
staying physically active
All foods should fit into a  balanced, sustainable eating pattern  that you can follow long term as part of an enjoyable lifestyle. You should not ever feel like you need to “cheat” when following your dietary plan.
Staying hydrated  is important when it comes to weight maintenance.
A small  2019 study  involving people ages 18 to 39 in Spain found that higher fluid intake was associated with healthier body composition, including a lower  body fat percentage  and smaller waist circumference.
Fluid needs  are dependent on many factors, including your activity levels and body size. One way to tell whether you’re hydrated is to  check your urine color .
Reducing your  added sugar intake  can promote weight loss and reduce the risk of conditions like  heart disease  and  metabolic syndrome .
Foods and beverages like cereals, sweetened  coffee  drinks,  soda , candy, and certain baked goods contain  added sugar  while offering few nutritional benefits. Essentially, they’re “empty” calories.
Try reducing your intake of these foods over time and using all forms of  sweeteners  less often or in smaller amounts.
Countless diets and  detoxes  promote rapid,  extreme weight loss  through the use of very low calorie meal plans.
While these diets are likely to promote quick weight loss by drastically  reducing your calorie intake , they’re not a good choice for  sustainable weight loss  since they can negatively affect your:
energy levels
performance
overall health
Studies have shown that crash or  “yo-yo” dieting  leads to  weight gain  and compensatory changes that may make future weight loss and weight maintenance more difficult.
A satisfying dietary pattern that fuels your body and creates a small  calorie deficit  will result in  slower weight loss , but it’ll decrease the chances of weight regain and ensure your body gets the nutrients it needs.
Nutrient-poor,  highly processed foods  are associated with weight gain and can  increase your risk  of developing heart disease, certain  cancers , and  obesity  if you eat them often.
Try to  cut back  on your consumption of  ultra-processed foods , including:
fast food
packaged snack products
soda
Protein  is the most filling  macronutrient , and adding  protein-rich  ingredients to meals and snacks can  increase feelings of satiety/satisfaction  and help manage your weight and hunger.
Eating  fiber-rich foods  like vegetables, fruits, beans, nuts, and  seeds  is also  beneficial for weight management  and satiety.
When putting together meals and snacks, aim to make them as filling and nutritious as possible by pairing them with sources of protein and  healthy fats , such as:
eggs
nuts
fish
chicken
unsweetened yogurt

15 to 18: Changes in lifestyle
While incorporating high intensity activity into  your routine  can promote weight loss and  muscle gain , it’s unnecessary to do  only  high intensity activities to  reach your goal weight .
Being  active daily  by increasing your step count or  meeting your step goals  is just as important as going to the gym.
If you’re averaging around 1,000  steps per day , try to increase your count to 2,500 steps most days of the week (about 1 mile [1.6 km]).
Once you consistently reach that goal, add 1,000 steps per week or so until you’re comfortably walking a few miles per day.
Sometimes life can get in the way when you’re in your 30s, reducing your sleep time and negatively affecting sleep quality.
Chronic  sleep deprivation  can  lead to weight gain  by increasing hunger  hormones  and calorie intake. It also decreases satiety hormones and energy levels, making weight loss even more challenging.
Getting at least  7 to 9 hours of sleep  consistently is important for  weight management  and your overall health.
Spending  time in nature  is incredibly beneficial for your overall health.
Research suggests that  spending more time outside  is associated with  higher activity levels  and less time sitting, which may help you lose weight. Spending time outside may also help reduce your  chronic disease risk  and stress levels.
Make a point to get outside daily  for a walk  or to enjoy fresh air.
Muscle mass  naturally declines  with age, starting in your 30s. One way to build and maintain muscle mass and  metabolism  is to engage in regular exercise.
Instead of jumping into an exercise routine based on the number of calories it burns, take the time to narrow down activities you truly  find enjoyable  and can imagine doing for life.
Zumba ,  hiking ,  biking ,  walking ,  Pilates ,  swimming , and  dancing  are just some examples of activities that people of all ages may find enjoyable.
Studies have linked  home-cooked meals  to  weight loss  and improved diet quality.
A 2020  study  that analyzed data from people ages 20 years and older found that those who prepared home-cooked meals at least 7 times per week had a higher healthy eating index score compared to those who cooked only 0 to 2 times per week.
This does not mean you have to cook every meal at home or that the meals need to be complex. You could use  meal planning apps  or  meal prep  recipes.
Try to increase the number of meals you prepare every week if you’re currently cooking only 1 or 2 meals a week.
Registered dietitians  and  therapists  can be helpful when trying to  lose weight  and improve your overall health.
They can help you understand your  relationship with food  and make beneficial changes to your physical and mental well-being.
When searching for a nutritionist or therapist, make sure they have proper credentials and that their counseling philosophies align with your specific needs.

The takeaway
If you’re in your 30s and want to lose weight, it’s important to use safe, sustainable methods to improve your overall health.
Restrictive diets and excessive calorie restriction can lead to rapid weight loss but also the inability to keep the weight off long term.
Using all or some of the 20 sustainable weight loss tips listed above can help you manage your weight while prioritizing your physical and mental health in your 30s.
