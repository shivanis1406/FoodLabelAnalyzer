Title: Sugar Busters Diet Review: Does It Work for Weight Loss?


Healthline Diet Score: 3.17 out of 5
The Sugar Busters Diet has gained widespread popularity over the past few decades.
Based on a book published in 1995 by a group of physicians, the diet focuses on limiting refined carbs and added sugars while increasing lean proteins, healthy fats, and high-fiber fruits and veggies.
Although some dismiss it as little more than a fad diet, others claim the plan can increase weight loss, manage blood sugar levels, and support better heart health.
This article reviews the Sugar Busters Diet and whether it’s effective for weight loss.

BOTTOM LINE:  The Sugar Busters Diet cuts out refined carbs and added sugars while encouraging certain fruits, veggies, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Its principles may aid weight loss, though the diet itself hasn’t been studied.

How does it work?
The Sugar Busters Diet is based on the theory that sugar is “toxic” and can cause weight gain by increasing levels of insulin — the hormone that transports sugar out of your bloodstream and into your cells.
Insulin is also responsible for regulating energy storage in your body. Chronically high levels of insulin have been associated with weight gain in many studies ( 1 ).
To minimize  insulin levels , the plan focuses on cutting out foods with a high glycemic index (GI), which is a measure of how much and quickly a specific food causes blood sugar levels to rise ( 2 ).
In place of high-carb options like pasta, white flour, and sweets, the diet encourages low-glycemic and fiber-rich foods, such as legumes, whole grains, healthy fats, and proteins.
The authors recommend limiting carbs to about 40% of your daily calories, with 30% coming from fat and 30% from protein.
Though the authors consider the diet a “correct carbohydrate lifestyle,” the macronutrient ratios may be defined as a mild low-carb diet by some sources ( 3 ).
The book also advises limiting  saturated fats  by opting for low-fat dairy products and lean cuts of meat.
Unlike other fad diets, the Sugar Busters Diet doesn’t require you to purchase pricey ingredients, special equipment, or expensive subscription plans. It’s also designed to be followed long term.
In addition, you don’t have to count calories, and it doesn’t place strict guidelines on how much physical activity you need to incorporate into your daily routine.
The diet recommends reducing refined carbs and processed foods that are high in calories and lacking in nutrients.
The authors claim that eating healthy, high-fiber ingredients can help stabilize blood sugar, decrease cholesterol levels, and manage your blood pressure.
The Sugar Busters Diet limits foods with a high glycemic index and encourages eating low-glycemic, fiber-rich foods, such as legumes, whole grains, healthy fats, and proteins.

Can it help you lose weight?
The Sugar Busters Diet doesn’t require you to count calories or track nutrients, but it does recommend reducing your consumption of refined carbs and added sugars.
Though research is limited, evidence suggests that this could be an effective strategy for  weight loss .
For example, one study in 2,834 adults found that eating a higher amount of refined carbs was associated with increased belly fat, while eating more whole grains was linked to less belly fat ( 4 ).
Another large review of 32 studies showed that sugar-sweetened beverages were tied to increased weight gain in both adults and children ( 5 ).
On the other hand, eating more fiber can stabilize blood sugar levels and slow the emptying of your stomach to increase feelings of fullness, decrease calorie intake, and support weight loss ( 6 ,  7 ).
Many studies also find that low-carb,  high-protein  diets — such as the Sugar Busters Diet — are effective at decreasing hunger, increasing weight loss, and reducing body fat ( 8 ,  9 ,  10 ).
One 10-week study in 89 overweight and obese women compared the effects of a high-protein, high-fiber diet with a high-carb, low-fat diet ( 11 ).
Participants on the high-fiber, high-protein diet lost significantly more body weight and body fat than those on the high-carb, low-fat diet ( 11 ).
Therefore, the Sugar Busters Diet may help decrease appetite and reduce calorie intake to promote weight loss — though more research on the diet itself is needed.
Reducing refined carbs and added sugars while increasing fiber intake may support weight loss. Some studies also show that low-carb, high-protein diets can promote weight loss and fat-burning.

Other benefits
In addition to supporting weight loss, the Sugar Busters Diet may be linked to several other health benefits as well.
Because it limits high-glycemic foods and refined carbs, it may help stabilize blood sugar levels and promote heart health.
In one 2-year study in 307 people, following a  low-carb diet  improved several heart disease risk factors.
Those on a low-carb diet experienced greater increases in HDL (good) cholesterol, as well as greater reductions in diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number), triglycerides, and LDL (bad) cholesterol than those on low-fat diets ( 10 ).
Another study found that a low-carb diet was more effective than a low-fat diet at reducing fasting blood sugar levels and hemoglobin A1C — a marker of long-term blood sugar control — in people with type 2 diabetes ( 12 ).
Additionally, cutting out added sugars can reduce inflammation in your body. Chronic inflammation has been linked to the onset and progression of many conditions, including heart disease, certain cancers, and obesity ( 13 ).
Other benefits of the Sugar Busters Diet are that it requires minimal nutrition knowledge, is easy to follow, and doesn’t have complicated rules or regulations.
This makes it a good choice for those looking to lose weight and improve their health without investing in expensive diet products or calculating calories and  macronutrients .
In addition to promoting weight loss, the Sugar Busters Diet may also help regulate blood sugar levels, promote heart health, and reduce inflammation.

Potential downsides
The Sugar Busters Diet relies heavily on restricting specific foods, including some that may contain important vitamins and minerals, such as certain types of fruit or starchy vegetables.
Instead of emphasizing a healthy, well-rounded diet, the Sugar Busters Diet also tends to label foods as “good” or “bad,” which could contribute to the development of unhealthy eating behaviors.
Additionally, while decreasing added sugars and  refined carbs  can improve overall health, completely cutting sugary foods out of your diet long term may be difficult for many and could contribute to cravings ( 14 ,  15 ,  16 ).
The diet also encourages the use of  sugar substitutes , such as aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose.
While these popular sweeteners have been approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), research suggests that they may cause adverse health effects ( 17 ,  18 ,  19 ,  20 ).
For example, artificial sweeteners may negatively impact blood sugar regulation, appetite, and body weight, and may even have harmful effects on the healthy bacteria in your gut ( 21 ).
Furthermore, the Sugar Busters Diet doesn’t provide specific guidelines for other key factors that are integral to a healthy lifestyle, such as portion sizes or physical activity.
Therefore, while the diet may be effective for short-term weight loss, it should be paired with other lifestyle changes and behavioral modifications for long-term success.
The Sugar Busters Diet cuts out many foods that contain important nutrients, it doesn’t address other lifestyle factors — such as exercise — and may be overly restrictive, potentially fostering unhealthy eating behaviors.

Foods to eat
The Sugar Busters Diet encourages eating low-glycemic fruits, as well as  fiber-rich foods  like whole grains and veggies.
