Title: Science-Backed Tips to Lose Weight Fast and Sustainably

Cutting carbs, eating more protein, lifting weights, and getting more sleep are all actions that can promote sustainable weight loss.
Focusing on long-term health and habits that you can stick with over time will help improve your health and are more likely to result in lasting weight loss.
Here are some science-backed tips to help you lose weight.

How to lose weight in 6 simple steps
Aim to include a variety of foods at each meal. To balance your plate, your meals should include protein, fat, vegetables, and  complex carbohydrates .
The following are the recommended amounts you should eat by age according to the  Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020–2025:
Eating a recommended amount of  protein  is essential to help preserve  muscle mass  while losing weight.
Diets with  adequate protein  may also  reduce  cravings and snacks by helping you feel full and satisfied.
The following are examples of foods that contain protein with amounts and servings from the  U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Data Central  database.
All vegetables can be nutrient-rich additions to your diet. Aim to eat about  2.5 cups  of vegetables daily.
Examples of vegetables include:
leafy greens
tomatoes
bell peppers
green beans
squash
Note that certain vegetables — like potatoes,  sweet potatoes , and  corn  — are considered  carbs  or grains when on the plate because they’re higher in carbs and calories. Be  mindful of your portion sizes  when adding these vegetables to your plate.
Healthy fats  like  olive oil ,  avocado , nuts, and seeds are great choices for your eating plan.
Although some oils, like olive oil, are considered healthy, they also provide 9 calories per gram, compared to protein and carbs, which provide only 4 calories per gram.
For this reason, it’s important to eat healthy fats in moderation and limit saturated and trans-saturated fats.
The following are examples of other foods that contain healthy fats:
Butter and  coconut oil  should be enjoyed  only in moderation  due to their high saturated fat content.
The  Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans  recommend combining  cardio workouts  with weight training for optimal health.
Cardio workouts include things like walking, jogging, running, cycling, or swimming. Learn more about  types of weight training exercises.
Be sure to talk with a doctor before starting a new exercise plan.
Fiber moves slowly through the digestive tract and can help you  feel fuller  for longer to support weight loss.
It might also  stabilize blood sugar levels , promote regularity, and protect against certain chronic conditions.
Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, breads, and  legumes  are food groups that contain a lot of fiber. Aim to eat  2 cups of fruit and 6 oz  of grains daily. Many vegetables and legumes also contain fiber.
The following are examples of foods that contain fiber with their recommended daily servings:
Having a good understanding of how your body responds to food and eating can help you make sure you’re not overeating. This is known as  mindful eating . It can involve the following:
eating more slowly
learning to recognize when you’re hungry vs. when you’re craving food for emotional reasons
cooking colorful foods with a variety of textures to prolong and enjoy your meals
The reason eating quickly can be problematic is that it doesn’t allow your brain to register consciously when you’re full.
Eating slowly  gives your stomach more time to tell your brain you’re full, which helps you learn to distinguish the feeling of genuine hunger vs. fullness. This  can result  in you eating less.
Try minimizing distractions while you eat and follow these  to slow down during your meals. Learn more about  mindful eating and weight loss.
Drinking plenty of water can help promote weight loss by  reducing  your food intake, especially if you drink water before a meal.
It might also work by  increasing  fat burning, which can help enhance long-term weight loss.
Be sure to choose water or other low calorie drinks rather than sugar-sweetened beverages like soda, which are high in sugar and calories and  could contribute  to weight gain.
Other benefits from  drinking water  related to weight loss  include  helping you stay hydrated while you exercise and helping remove waste from the body. In general, drinking water helps your body run more efficiently.
In addition to changing your diet and exercise routine, getting enough sleep each night may be beneficial for weight loss.
One study found that people who regularly sleep less than 7 hours per night are  more likely  to have a higher  body mass index  and develop obesity than those who sleep more.
Plus,  sleep deprivation  might also alter levels of hormones that control hunger and appetite.
As a general rule of thumb, it’s recommended to aim for at least  7 hours  of high quality sleep each night.

What about calories and portion control?
It’s not always necessary to  count calories  as long as you follow a balanced  diet rich in protein , fat, and vegetables.
If you’re not losing weight, you may want to keep track of your calories to see if that’s a contributing factor.
Try using a free  online calculator  to estimate your calorie needs.
Eating too few calories can be  dangerous and less effective  for losing weight. Aim to reduce your calories by a sustainable and healthy amount based on a doctor’s recommendation.
Counting calories may be a helpful tool for some, but it may not be the best choice for everyone.
If you’re preoccupied with food or weight, feel guilt surrounding your food choices, or routinely engage in restrictive diets, consider reaching out for support. These behaviors may indicate a disordered relationship with food or an eating disorder.
Talk with a qualified healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian, if you’re struggling.
You can also chat, call, or text anonymously with trained volunteers at the  National Eating Disorders Association  helpline for free or explore the organization’s free and low cost resources.

How fast will you lose weight?
You may lose weight more quickly in the first week of a diet plan and then at a slower but more consistent rate after that. In the first week, you typically lose a mix of both  body fat  and water weight.
If this is the first time you’re changing your diet and exercise habits, weight loss may happen more quickly. Losing 0.5–2 pounds (lbs) per week is a  safe amount  to aim for.

Frequently asked questions
Reducing your  calorie intake  and adding more physical activity to your routine can help you  lose weight quickly  and sustainably. That said, each person is different, and there may be other factors that need to be considered, such as your diet, what medications you’re taking, your hormones, your mood, and genetics.
Decreasing your intake of  processed foods  and  added sugar  can help you lose weight in 7 days.
Drinking plenty of water and adding fiber to your diet might also help. That said, many factors influence your ability to lose weight, and it’s better to aim for slower and more  sustainable weight loss  of 0.5–2 lbs per week.
Exercising, staying hydrated, and enjoying a balanced diet rich in nutrient-dense foods can help you  lose 20 pounds  or reach your healthy goal weight.
For safe and healthy weight loss, 0.5–2 pounds of weight loss per week is a realistic weight loss goal that you are more likely to maintain.
Eating protein, fat, and vegetables; drinking more water; increasing the fiber in your diet; and adding exercise may all help you reach your weight loss goals. But there may be other things to consider, like what medications you take, other health conditions you have, your hormones, and genetics.
Losing 10 pounds in a week is not realistic or sustainable. For safe and  healthy weight loss , aim for 0.5–2 pounds of weight loss per week by changing your diet and lifestyle.
Losing 15 pounds in 2 weeks is unrealistic, unsustainable, and likely unsafe. Healthy weight loss is 0.5–2 pounds of weight loss per week, and you may be most likely to do this by changing your diet and modifying your lifestyle.

Bottom line
While losing weight quickly may be your goal, it’s important to think about the long run.
While you may  lose water weight  quickly,  fat loss  takes longer, and developing sustainable weight loss may take longer than you’d like.
Following a balanced diet and staying active can help support long-term weight loss.
