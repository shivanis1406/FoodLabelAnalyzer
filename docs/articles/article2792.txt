Title: 4 Ways to Tell If Ground Beef Is Bad

Ground beef may be your kitchen burger staple, but how do you tell your ground beef has gone bad? Changes to color, texture, and smell, along with the expiration date can offer clues.
Ground beef is commonly used to make burgers, meatballs, and sausage, as well as tacos, lasagna, and savory pies. It accounts for  about 62%  of all beef sold in the United States.
However, since grinding the meat exposes more of its surface to air, spoilage organisms have more space to attach to it. Thus, it goes bad faster than steak or other larger cuts.
Spoilage and pathogenic bacteria may both affect ground beef. These bacteria are  generally not harmful  but cause food to lose quality and develop a bad odor and taste.
On the other hand, pathogenic bacteria are dangerous, as they can lead to  food poisoning . Furthermore, spoilage makes it more likely for them to be present in your food. Therefore, even though spoilage bacteria won’t make you sick, you should always discard spoiled ground beef to avoid consuming disease-causing microorganisms.
Here are 4 ways to tell whether your ground beef has gone bad.

Check the color
Ground beef may change color due to  multiple factors , including temperature, light, microbial growth, and exposure to oxygen .
Fresh, raw ground beef should be red due to its levels of oxymyoglobin — a pigment formed when a protein called myoglobin reacts with oxygen.
The interior of raw ground meat may be greyish brown due to a lack of exposure to oxygen. This doesn’t indicate spoilage.
Nevertheless, you should throw away ground beef if it has turned either brown or gray on the outside, as this indicates that it’s beginning to rot.
Additionally,  mold  can spoil cooked ground beef, so you should toss your leftovers if you notice any fuzzy blue, grey, or green spots.

Inspect the texture
Another way to check your ground beef is by conducting a touch test. Fresh ground beef should have a relatively firm consistency that breaks apart when you squeeze it.
However, a sticky or slimy texture — either when cooked or raw — may  indicate  the presence of spoilage bacteria. You should toss it immediately.
To avoid spreading bacteria from one surface to another,  wash your hands thoroughly  after touching  raw meat .

Perform a smell test
This test is probably the easiest and fastest way to determine whether  meat  has spoiled. It applies to both raw and cooked ground beef.
Though the scent of fresh ground beef is barely perceptible, rancid meat has a tangy, putrid odor. Once it goes bad, it’s no longer safe to eat.
The scent  changes due to  the increased growth of spoilage bacteria, such as  Lactobacillus  spp. and  Pseudomonas  spp., which may also affect the flavor.
If you don’t notice a funny scent but still see signs of spoilage in color or texture, it’s still  safest to throw it away , as pathogenic bacteria cannot be smelled.

4. Check the expiration date
Sell-by and  expiration dates  are additional guidelines for determining whether your ground beef is good.
A sell-by date tells the retailer how long a product can be displayed for sale. Ground beef can be refrigerated and safely eaten  up to 2 days  past this date.
Meanwhile, the expiration date — also labeled as “best before” — tells you when the product will likely start going bad. Food will have the best taste and quality before this date.
You shouldn’t eat ground beef past its expiration date unless it’s been frozen, which can last up to 4 months.
Be sure to carefully  read the product label  when buying ground beef.

Side effects of eating bad beef
Spoiled ground beef is dangerous to eat because it may contain pathogenic bacteria, which are responsible for  foodborne illnesses . Symptoms include  fever ,  vomiting ,  stomach cramps , and  diarrhea  — which may be bloody.
Disease-causing microorganisms grow rapidly in food that’s been left at room temperature and are more likely to occur in spoiled food.
The  most common  harmful bacteria in ground beef are  Salmonella  and Shiga toxin-producing  E. coli  (STEC). Outbreaks of infections related to these bacteria occur fairly frequently in the United States. It may take several days for symptoms to appear.
To destroy these bacteria and reduce your risk of food poisoning, cook ground beef thoroughly and use a meat thermometer to verify that its  internal temperature  reaches 160°F (71°C).
It’s safest to never eat raw or spoiled ground beef.

How to safely handle ground beef
Proper handling and storing are key to avoiding  food poisoning  from ground beef. Here are a few safety tips:
To minimize the time that ground beef is left unrefrigerated, buy it last and head home directly from the store.
Choose a cold package to the touch and in good condition, without holes or scratches.
Check the color and expiration date of the meat.
Keep raw meat separately in your cart to avoid cross-contamination or the spread of bacteria to other food items.
Refrigerate or freeze it when you get home or within 2 hours of purchase. Make sure the fridge temperature is below 40°F (4°C).
Keep it in a bag on the lowest shelf to prevent its juices from leaking.
Thaw frozen beef in the fridge to keep it cold while defrosting. Never leave at room temperature for more than 2 hours.
Refrigerate your  leftovers  within 2 hours of cooking and eat them within 3–4 days.
Remember to wash your hands thoroughly after handling ground beef, and don’t forget to your clean kitchen counters and utensils.

Frequently asked questions
Below are frequently asked questions regarding ground beef.
Spoiled ground beef will have a pungent, putrid smell. Ground beef that is safe to eat typically has little to no perceptible smell.
All ground beef has a slight aroma of  iron . Ground beef nearing its expiration date may have a slightly more noticeable smell but is still safe to eat. However, if a product has a noticeable, pungent smell, it is most likely spoiled and should be discarded.
When inspecting a package of ground beef, it is common for the outside to appear red or pink, while the inside may appear grey or brown. This is due to a lack of oxygen in the center of the beef.
However, if ground beef is grey on the outside, it is unsafe to cook and consume and should be disposed of.

The bottom line
Ground beef is very popular but highly perishable.
A few simple techniques, including looking for changes in color, odor, and texture, can determine whether your ground beef has gone bad.
Though the bacteria that cause meat to spoil aren’t generally harmful, other disease-causing microorganisms may proliferate when it goes bad. To reduce your risk of illness, you should always  cook meat thoroughly  and avoid eating spoiled or undercooked ground beef.
