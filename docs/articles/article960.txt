Title: Chickweed: Benefits, Side Effects, Precautions, and Dosage

Chickweed is an herb traditionally believed to aid weight loss, heal wounds, and reduce inflammation. However, most research on chickweed has been done in test tubes or on animals, so its benefits in humans remain unclear.
Chickweed, also called starweed, satin flower, or mouse-ear, is a common weed in the carnation family.
It grows low to the ground, has a hairy stem, and produces small, star-shaped, white flowers. It’s native to Europe but can be found in all  50 states  in the United States of America.
Chickweed has many culinary and folk remedy uses that date back centuries, with people believing it may help treat certain ailments. However, while these historical uses are well-documented, there is limited scientific research to confirm its effectiveness.

Benefits of chickweed
It’s important to note that the benefits listed below are the result of older studies that pertain only to animals.
To better understand the effects of chickweed on humans, more recent and high quality research is necessary.
One 2011 study  found that orally administered chickweed extract suppressed  progesterone -induced obesity in mice.
All of the mice with progesterone-induced  obesity  experienced significant increases in body weight, body fat, and liver fat.
However, those that were also given 90–180 mg of chickweed extract per pound (200–400 mg per kg) of body weight experienced significant decreases in these measurements, compared with the control and progesterone-treated groups.
What’s more, another  2012 study  in mice fed a high fat diet for 6 weeks found that consuming freeze-dried chickweed juice prevented weight gain and increases in body fat and total and  LDL (bad) cholesterol , compared with a control group.
These anti-obesity effects were attributed to the delayed absorption of dietary fats and carbs in the intestines as a result of the digestive-inhibiting enzymes in the chickweed juice.
If you’re experiencing  phlegm buildup , chickweed may be helpful.
Some animal and test-tube studies indicate that chickweed is a good  expectorant , meaning it  may help  loosen mucus, thus helping you  cough .
One review  found that applying whole chickweed as a plaster to swollen areas or even broken bones could provide anti-inflammatory, anti-irritation, and soothing effects.
Another review  observed that the whole plant can fight  inflammation  when used for inflamed skin, joints, and respiratory tract illnesses like  bronchitis .
Chickweed may fight germs and help heal wounds and  infections . It has been used for these purposes in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries,  primarily for  skin diseases.
In Ireland and Britain, chickweed is a  common remedy  for alleviating skin problems, speeding  wound healing , and reducing irritation and itchiness.
One test-tube study  found that applying fresh chickweed juice could fight the  hepatitis B virus  (HBV). Applying the juice to an HBV-infected liver cell line for 6 days reduced HBV growth and production by over 25%.

Downsides and precautions
Consuming excessive amounts of chickweed  can cause  nausea and  diarrhea . Plus, the plant is high in saponins, which are compounds that may cause an upset stomach in some people.
It has also been reported that using chickweed directly on the skin could cause  contact dermatitis  in some people, though this may be due to an allergy.
Furthermore, there’s not enough evidence that using chickweed is safe for children or women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, so these populations should avoid the plant to prevent adverse outcomes.

Uses and doses for chickweed
Chickweed can be used in a number of ways, though there’s no clinical evidence to suggest a suitable dosage. Keep in mind that it’s best to speak with your doctor before using it.
It’s important to note that essential oils are for topical use only and should not be consumed.
The whole chickweed plant can be applied directly to irritated skin to potentially reduce inflammation.
You can also find chickweed salves or ointments that can be used to soothe  bug bites ,  burns , cuts, and itchiness, as they’re said to have a cooling and drying effect on the skin.
Chickweed-infused oil can be added to a bath or applied to your skin.
To make infused chickweed oil, chop 2 cups (100 grams) of fresh chickweed leaves and leave them on your countertop to wilt for about 24 hours.
Then, combine the leaves with 1 1/4 cups (270 grams) of  coconut oil  in a blender until smooth. Heat this mixture in a double boiler until it’s warmed through. Turn off the heat and let the mixture sit for 3 hours. Repeat the warming and sitting step 4 more times.
The oil is ready to use when it takes on a green hue. At this point, strain it to remove any large pieces of leaves.
Note that  essential oils  should be diluted with a  carrier oil , and they should never be ingested. They’re for topical use only.
Also, before topical application of the oil, a skin allergist can perform a  patch test  for you. This includes applying the substance to a patch, which is then applied to your skin to determine if you may have an adverse reaction.
While essential oils have a varying shelf life, most types last for at least a year if stored properly in a cool, dark place in a sterile container with an airtight lid.
Chickweed leaves can be steeped in hot water to make a  tea  that potentially relieves pain, reduces inflammation, and provides calming, soothing effects.
To make your own chickweed tea, add 1 1/2 cups (300 grams) of chickweed leaves to 3 cups (710 mL) of water and simmer over medium heat for approximately 10 minutes. Filter out the leaves and enjoy.
Old herbal folklore suggests enjoying a cup of this tea every 2–3 hours, though there’s no research to suggest how often you should drink it to reap its potential benefits.
You can add chopped chickweed leaves to dishes like soups, egg recipes, pastas, or pizzas.
It can also be blended into dips and sauces like pesto or hummus.

The Takeaway
Chickweed is a common weed that may offer a number of potential health benefits.
It can be applied directly to your skin, made into tea, eaten raw, or infused into an oil for topical use.
The plant is believed to help reduce inflammation and soothe irritated skin, with possible applications in disease treatment and obesity prevention.
However, these claims are based on the findings of animal and test-tube studies. Therefore, these benefits may not necessarily apply to humans.
Ultimately, more research is needed to confirm these effects.
As with other herbs, it should not be used without approval from a doctor. Children and people who are pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid using it due to a lack of evidence on its safety in these populations.
