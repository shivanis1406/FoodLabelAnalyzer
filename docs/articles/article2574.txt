Title: Fruits that Help with Cancer Treatment Effects

Eating a variety of fruits during and after cancer treatment can be beneficial. Bananas, strawberries, and apples are among some of the fruits that can help relieve symptoms.
Your diet can affect your risk of developing cancer. Similarly, filling up on healthy foods is important if you are being treated for or recovering from cancer.
Certain foods, including fruits, contain health-promoting compounds that may slow tumor growth and reduce certain side effects of treatment to help ease your road to recovery.
But it’s important to remember that cancer treatments may compromise your immune system, so have caution and always wash your raw fruits and vegetables.
Here are the 12 best fruits to eat during and after cancer treatment.

Fruit choices for those with cancer
When being treated for or recovering from cancer, your food choices are incredibly important.
Cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation can cause many side effects, which can be either worsened or improved by what you eat and drink.
Common side effects of  chemotherapy  and  radiation  include:
fatigue
anemia
nausea
vomiting
changes in appetite
diarrhea
constipation
painful swallowing
dry mouth
mouth sores
impaired focus
mood changes
Eating nutritious foods, including  fruits , helps supply your body with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants throughout your cancer treatment.
However, it’s important to tailor your fruit choices to your specific symptoms.
For example, puréed fruits or fruit smoothies are a good option if you have  difficulty swallowing , while fruits rich in fiber can help if you’re experiencing constipation.
You may also want to avoid certain fruits based on your symptoms. Citrus fruits, for example, may irritate mouth sores and worsen dry mouth.
Whole fruits like  apples ,  apricots , and  pears  are hard for some people with cancer to eat due to:
mouth sores
difficulty swallowing
dry mouth
nausea
Also , remember to exercise caution when consuming raw fruits, as many cancer patients are immunocompromised. The  American Cancer Society  recommends washing and lightly scrubbing any raw fruits or vegetables  under running water.
Lastly, you can opt for organic fruits for decreased pesticides.
Some foods can either worsen or improve certain side effects of cancer treatments. It’s best to tailor your fruit choices to your specific symptoms.

1. Blueberries
Blueberries  are a nutritional powerhouse. In each serving, blueberries pack plenty of:
fiber
vitamin C
manganese
According to the Obesity Medicine Association, they’re also rich in antioxidants and are one of many fruits thought to be beneficial in  cancer protection .
A  2021 review  of blueberries found studies on adults and schoolchildren supporting their benefits for brain:
protection
health
function
But a limitation is that the studies included in the review did not specifically test people undergoing cancer treatment.
It’s important to keep the brain functioning as much as possible by eating a well-balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables.
Blueberries may be beneficial in cancer protection and brain health.

2. Oranges
Oranges are a common type of  citrus fruit , favored for their:
sweet taste
vibrant color
nutrient profile
Just  one orange  can meet and exceed your daily needs for vitamin C, all while supplying other important nutrients like:
thiamine
folate
potassium
According to a  2024 study  from New Zealand, ascorbate, another term for vitamin C, levels are low in patients with  metastatic melanoma  receiving  immunotherapy  and those being treated with chemotherapy. This suggests that cancer patients may want to supplement or increase their intake of dietary vitamin C to  boost immune health .
Research from a  2019 study  suggests that vitamin C may also be therapeutic against certain types of cancer, such as breast cancer.
Vitamin C from oranges can also boost the  absorption of iron  from foods. This helps protect against anemia, a common  side effect  of cancer therapies.
Oranges are a great source of vitamin C, which can help strengthen your immune function, act as a therapeutic against breast cancer, and increase iron absorption.

3. Bananas
Bananas  can be a great dietary addition for those recovering from cancer.
Raw bananas  are an easy-to-tolerate food for those with swallowing difficulties and a good source of many important nutrients, including:
vitamin B6
manganese
vitamin C
Additionally, bananas contain a type of fiber called  pectin , which can be especially beneficial for those experiencing  diarrhea or constipation  caused by cancer treatments.
Because bananas are  rich in potassium . They can also help replenish  electrolytes  lost through diarrhea or vomiting.
Furthermore, a  2022 review  of animal and human studies found an association between the  anticancer properties  of pectin and the prevention or treatment of:
breast cancer
colon cancer
gastric cancer
pancreatic cancer
hepatocellular cancer
bladder cancer
prostate cancer
ovarian cancer
leukemia
myeloma
skin cancer
brain cancer
lung cancer
That said, more research is needed to determine whether the pectin found in bananas could slow  cancer cell growth  in humans.
Bananas contain pectin, which has anti-diarrhea, anti-constipation, and anticancer properties against several forms of cancer.

4. Grapefruit
Grapefruit  is a nutritious fruit loaded with:
antioxidants
vitamins
minerals
In addition to providing a hearty dose of vitamin C, provitamin A, and potassium,  raw grapefruit  is rich in beneficial compounds like lycopene.
Lycopene  is a  carotenoid  with potent anticancer properties. Some research performed on mice suggests that it may reduce certain negative side effects of cancer treatments, such as  chemotherapy  and  radiation .
A  2021 review  of citrus fruit and  citrus juices  suggests they benefit blood-brain barrier function and integrity, which may, in turn, help chemo brain. More human research, however, is needed to make these claims.
Grapefruit might interfere with certain medications, so it’s best to talk with your doctor before adding it to your diet.
Grapefruit is rich in antioxidants like lycopene, which has anticancer properties and may reduce some side effects of cancer treatments. Lycopene has also been shown to positively effect brain health, which may ease chemo brain.

5. Apples
Each  100 g serving  of a gala apple is rich in fiber and potassium — both of which can benefit cancer recovery.
Both the  soluble and insoluble fiber  found in apples can:
promote regularity
ease digestion
increase satiety
Potassium  affects your  fluid balance  and can help prevent  sodium retention , a common side effect of some types of chemotherapy.
An alternative for those with swallowing difficulties is applesauce. And for decreased pesticides, opt for organic apples.
Apples are high in fiber, potassium, and vitamin C. They can help promote regularity, reduce fluid retention, and support immune health.

6. Lemons
Lemons  deliver a burst of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants in every serving. They can be added to water for even more vitamin C.
Raw lemons  are especially high in vitamin C but also contain some:
potassium
iron
vitamin B6
A  2022 study  in mice found that an herbal blend of lemon and  ginger  was associated with  anticancer effects  and decreased the size of tumors.
According to a  2023 human study , inhaling  lemon essential oil  may also enhance:
brain activation
mood
memory function
concentration
This enhanced cognitive function may also help alleviate chemo brain, though the study didn’t look specifically at this.
While more research is needed to confirm the effect of lemons and cancer treatment, enjoying lemons in your favorite drinks or desserts as part of a well-balanced diet could be beneficial.
Lemons have been shown to decrease the size of tumors in animal studies. Lemons also contain compounds that may boost your mood and, by association, reduce chemo brain.

7. Pomegranates
Pomegranates are nutritious and brimming with  health benefits , making them a great addition to any diet.
Like other fruits,  raw pomegranates  are high in vitamin C and fiber but also pack plenty of:
vitamin K
folate
potassium
Plus, some research from a  2023 review  has found that consuming pomegranates,  pomegranate juice , or pomegranate extract may be related to improved:
working memory
delayed memory
immediate memory
This may help those affected by impairments in focus or concentration caused by chemotherapy.
Past studies in this review have also found that pomegranate has anticancer properties.
What’s more,  studies  have found that pomegranates may help reduce  joint pain , another common side effect of cancer treatments like chemotherapy.
Pomegranates may help improve memory and reduce joint pain, both of which are common side effects of cancer treatments.

8. Mulberries
Mulberries  are a type of colorful fruit from the same family as  figs  and breadfruit.
They have been used to treat cancer in many traditional forms of medication, and emerging  research  has begun to confirm their potential cancer-fighting effects.
Mulberries  are one of the few fruits rich in both vitamin C and  iron , which may help protect against anemia caused by cancer treatments.
They’re also high in a type of plant fiber known as lignin. Lignins have been associated with health benefits and protect against  cardiovascular disease  and hormone-dependent tumors in some  studies .
Additional studies are needed to evaluate if eating mulberries in normal amounts may be beneficial during and after cancer treatment.
Mulberries are high in vitamin C and iron, which can help reduce the risk of anemia. They also contain lignin, which may have health benefits and anticancer properties.

9. Pears
Pears  are highly nutritious, supplying a wealth of:
fiber
potassium
vitamin C
vitamin K
Like bananas, the potassium content in pears can help restore electrolytes lost from diarrhea during cancer treatment. And similar to apples, they can also help maintain fluid levels.
Pears may also contain powerful cancer-fighting compounds. A  2021 review  found that flavonoids and triterpenoids, both of which pears contain, may have anticancer and anti-tumor effects.
Pears are rich in potassium, flavinoids, and triterpenoids, which are associated with reduced cancer growth.

10. Strawberries
Strawberries  are rich in:
vitamin C
phosphorus
potassium
In addition to boasting an impressive nutrient profile, strawberries may offer several benefits specific to cancer recovery.
Ripe strawberries are also soft, making them suitable for those with mild swallowing difficulties.
Strawberries contain anthocyanin, which is a potent  anticancer antioxidant .
Studies  have also found that strawberries may be:
anti-inflammatory
anti-microbial
chemopreventive
Chemopreventive means that strawberries may help prevent cancer from coming back.
A  2022 review  included animal studies that found an association between strawberry consumption in combination with other treatments had a tumor-shrinking effect on esophageal cancer.
That said, more high quality studies are needed to determine if strawberries exhibit anticancer effects in humans when eaten as part of a healthy diet.
Strawberries are rich in antioxidants and may help decrease cancer cell growth. Ripe berries are also soft, making them a good choice for those with mild swallowing difficulties.

11. Cherries
Cherries  are a type of  stone fruit  that belongs to the same genus as:
peaches
plums
apricots
Each 100 g serving of  cherries  supplies a hearty dose of:
vitamin C
potassium
phosphorus
These small fruits are also a good source of health-benefitting antioxidants, like:
beta-carotene
lutein
zeaxanthin
Many  studies  have found that the  antioxidants  found in red fruits, including cherries, could have anticancer effects.
One  2023 test-tube  study showed that cherry extract may also enhance anticancer therapies. Researchers found that cherry extract was associated with an increased uptake of oral drugs used to treat cancer.
Another  2021 review  observed the anticancer effects of cherries in animal studies. Cherries were associated with a decrease in tumor growth and size.
However, additional research is needed to evaluate if these findings also apply to humans when cherries are eaten in normal amounts.
Cherries are rich in antioxidants and have been shown to decrease the growth of cancer cells in test-tube and animal studies.

12. Blackberries
Blackberries  are a popular fruit that is high in:
vitamin C
manganese
vitamin K
potassium
folate
Blackberries also contain an array of  antioxidants , including:
ellagic acid
gallic acid
chlorogenic acid
According to some  research , eating  berries  may help protect against:
DNA damage
neutralize free radicals
slow the growth and spread of cancer cells
Other  animal studies  suggest that berries may be related to brain health and  enhanced memory  performance, potentially preventing certain side effects of chemotherapy.
However, further studies are needed to determine if blackberries offer similar benefits in humans.
Blackberries are rich in antioxidants that may help protect against cancer. Animal studies show that they may also promote brain health, which could prevent certain side effects of cancer treatment.
