Title: 9 Healthy Coffee Creamer Alternatives

If you’re a coffee lover, you may have a go-to creamer that adds flavor and creaminess to your daily cup of joe.
Although coffee creamers are delicious, some popular creamers are high in added sugar and contain ingredients such as high fructose corn syrup, oils, and carrageenan, as well as artificial flavors, sweeteners, and colors, which many people prefer to avoid.
For example, both International Delight and Coffee Mate vanilla-flavored creamers contain 5 grams of added sugar per 1-tablespoon (15-mL) serving ( 1 ,  2 ).
Most people use much more than the recommended serving size. As such, you could be consuming 10 grams — or 2.5 teaspoons — of added sugar if you use just 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of these creamers in your coffee.
High added sugar intake is linked to an increased risk of weight gain, metabolic syndrome, depressive symptoms, and other negative effects, so it’s best to limit your intake of added sugar as much as possible — including in your coffee creamer ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ).
Fortunately, it’s easy to make your own coffee creamer at home. A number of low sugar or zero-sugar premade coffee creamers are available as well.
Here are 9 healthier coffee creamer alternatives.

1–4. Homemade coffee creamer alternatives
Instead of spending money on premade coffee creamers, try making your own at home.
Doing so is simple and lets you control which ingredients are added and left out. The best part of making your own creamer is that you can experiment with different flavors and bases depending on your preferences.
Here are 4 creamers you can whip up in just a few minutes.
Canned  coconut milk  is a perfect base for homemade coffee creamers. It’s thick and has the rich texture of store-bought creamers.
This vanilla coconut milk creamer recipe couldn’t be any easier.
Simply dump a can of coconut milk into a glass jar. Then add 1–2 teaspoons (5–10 mL) of vanilla extract, seal the jar, and shake for 30 seconds. Optionally, add a small amount of sweetener like  maple syrup  or honey.
Keep this mixture in your fridge for up to a week.

For people who enjoy pumpkin-flavored coffee year-round, this pumpkin spice creamer recipe from  Thyme and Joy  is essential.
1/2 cup (120 mL) coconut cream
1/2 cup (120 mL) almond milk
1/4 cup (56 grams)  pumpkin puree
1/8 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/8 teaspoon ground  cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon vanilla bean powder
1 pinch sea salt
Blend all ingredients in a high speed blender until fully combined.
Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 7–10 days.
Store-bought chocolate-flavored coffee creamers are often high in added sugar, but this version from  Nyssa’s Kitchen  is made with simple ingredients and sweetened with dates, not sugar.
1 cup (150 grams) cashews, soaked overnight in water and drained
4 cups (945 mL) filtered water
3–4 pitted  dates  (or a small amount of maple syrup)
1/4 cup (30 grams)  cacao  powder
1 teaspoon (5 mL) vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
Rinse  cashews  with cold water after soaking them overnight.
Add cashews to a blender with water, dates, cacao powder, vanilla, cinnamon, and  sea salt .
Blend on high for about 2 minutes, until smooth, creamy, and frothy.
Store in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
If you prefer powdered creamers, you’ll love  this homemade powdered creamer  that uses coconut milk powder — though you may want to use less sweetener than the recipe calls for. (You can use milk powder in place of coconut milk powder if you’d prefer.)
To make your own powdered creamer, simply pulse coconut milk powder in a food processor or blender with ingredients of your choice, such as cacao powder, vanilla bean powder, cinnamon, or pumpkin pie spice.
If you choose to add a granulated sweetener like monk fruit, date sugar, or coconut sugar, be sure to blend it into a fine powder before mixing it into the coconut milk powder.
Store powdered creamer at room temperature in a sealed container.

5–9. Commercial coffee creamers
If you prefer to purchase premade coffee creamer, it’s important to read the nutrition facts and ingredient lists on coffee creamer  labels .
Try to choose brands that have less than 2 grams of added sugar per serving and are free of added oils, artificial colors, and  high fructose corn syrup .
Here are a few healthy store-bought coffee creamers.

Otherwise, try one of the better-for-you premade  coffee creamer products  listed above.
Try this today:  If you can’t imagine giving up your current coffee creamer, start by using less. For example, if you currently add 3 tablespoons (45 mL) of creamer to your coffee, try adding just 1 tablespoon (15 mL). This will  cut your sugar intake  significantly.
