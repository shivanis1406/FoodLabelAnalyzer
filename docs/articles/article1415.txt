Title: 14 Everyday Uses for Tea Tree Oil

Tea tree oil may have benefits for topical use. It may target certain bacteria and support skin health when used as directed.
Tea tree oil is an essential oil with several uses, including keeping skin, hair, and nails healthy.
In addition to its scientifically backed benefits, tea tree oil is inexpensive and safe when used as directed.
This article discusses 14 everyday uses for tea tree oil and provides guidance on using it safely and effectively.

What is tea tree oil, and how does it work?
Tea tree oil comes from the leaves of Melaleuca alternifolia, a small tree native to Australia.
Although Melaleuca alternifolia is known as the tea tree, it is not the same plant whose leaves are used to make black, green, and  oolong tea .
Tea tree oil has been used as a traditional medicine by the Aboriginal people of Australia for centuries to treat coughs and colds or apply it directly to the skin for healing.
You can buy tree oil essential oil 100% undiluted or neat. Diluted forms, ranging from 5–50% strength, are also available in products designed for the skin.
Tea tree oil contains several compounds, including terpinen-4-ol, that  can destroy  certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
Tea tree oil’s germ-fighting properties make it a valued natural remedy for treating bacterial and fungal skin conditions, preventing infection, and promoting healing.
Read on to learn about the many uses and benefits of this oil.

Hand sanitizer
Tea tree oil makes an ideal natural hand sanitizer.
Studies  suggest tea tree oil can destroy several common bacteria and viruses that cause illness, including E. coli, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae.
Hand sanitizers with tea tree oil are  effective  for hand disinfection, killing bacteria without antibiotics.

Insect repellent
Tea tree oil may help keep insects away.
Tea tree oil is  lethal  against larvae and adult house flies.
Tea tree oil  can also help  keep ants off of produce in agriculture.
It is also an  effective  mosquito repellent.
An  older test-tube study  revealed that tea tree oil could repel mosquitoes more than DEET, the most common active ingredient in commercial insect repellents. However, the study noted that other essential oils were more effective than tea tree oil. These included:
rosemary
lavender
eucalyptus
citronella

Natural deodorant
Tea tree oil’s antibacterial effects may help manage underarm odor related to perspiration.
Sweat  itself does not smell. But when secretions from your sweat glands combine with bacteria on your skin, a moderate to strong odor may be produced.
Your underarm area contains a large concentration of these glands, which are mainly responsible for what is commonly referred to as body odor. Tea tree oil’s bacteria-fighting properties make it an ideal  natural alternative  to commercial deodorants and antiperspirants.
You can make your own safe and effective  natural deodorant  from tea tree oil and other ingredients.

Antiseptic for minor cuts and scrapes
Injuries resulting from broken skin make it easy for germs to enter your bloodstream, leading to infection.
Tea tree oil can treat and disinfect minor cuts and abrasions by  targeting  S. aureus and other bacteria that can cause infection in open wounds.
To disinfect a cut or scrape, follow these steps:
Clean the cut thoroughly with plain soap and water.
Mix one drop of tea tree oil with one teaspoon of  coconut oil .
Apply a small amount to the injury and cover with a bandage.
Repeat this process once or twice daily until a scab has formed.

May support wound healing
Tea tree oil prevents infection in cuts and abrasions and, when combined with traditional methods, may also encourage wound healing.
Research  suggests tea tree oil may help reduce inflammation and trigger the activity of white blood cells that are essential in the healing process.
Because of tea tree oil’s antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant properties, it may help reduce inflammation and enhance healing.
In a  small study  of 10 people with wounds from 2013, adding tea tree oil to conventional wound treatment led to decreased healing time in all but one participant. The researchers noted that additional research with a larger study is still needed to support this use of tea tree oil.
A few drops of diluted tea tree oil can be added to the wound dressing each time a new dressing is applied.

Reduce acne
Research  suggests that tea tree oil may help reduce, manage, and prevent some types of  acne , particularly acne vulgaris, which typically involves bacteria on the skin.
The antibacterial effects of tea tree oil may help it reduce the presence of bacteria on the skin.  Research from 2020  that application not only reduced the activity of bacteria but also eradicated them in the lab after 4 to 6 hours.
However,  other researchers  noted that additional research with fewer variables is still needed to support the use of tea tree oil for acne.
You can find tea tree oil-based acne gels at natural grocery stores or online.
Alternatively, you can make your own acne treatment by mixing one part tea tree oil with nine parts water and applying the mixture to affected areas with a cotton swab once or twice a day, as needed.

Get rid of fungus
Fungal nail infections are quite common. Although they aren’t dangerous, they can be unsightly. There are medications that can treat nail fungus, but some people may prefer a more natural approach.
Tea tree oil  may help  get rid of nail fungus when used alone or in combination with other natural remedies, with fewer side effects than traditional medications.
In a  2020 study , tea tree oil inhibited the growth of nail fungus in a lab setting. Researchers noted that, depending on the strain, it took .02% to .04% strength tea tree oil to inhibit fungal growth.
A  2021 study  suggests that, when used with traditional treatment, tea tree oil may improve the effectiveness of treatment for fungal skin infections.
You can use a few drops of tea tree oil alone or mix it with an equal amount of coconut oil or another  carrier oil . Then, apply it to the affected area. Be sure to wash your hands immediately after applying in order to avoid spreading the fungus to other areas.

Chemical-free mouthwash
Research  suggests that tea tree oil may fight germs that cause tooth decay and  bad breath .
A  2020 study  found that tea tree oil mouthwash was an effective treatment to reduce the inflammation of gingivitis.
To make your own chemical-free mouthwash, simply add a drop of tea tree oil to a cup of warm water, mix thoroughly, and swish in your mouth for 30 seconds or so.
Like other mouthwashes, tea tree oil should not be swallowed. It  can be toxic  if ingested.

All-purpose cleaner
Tea tree oil makes a great all-purpose cleaner that also sanitizes surfaces. In addition to  being effective  against certain bacteria and fungi, it  may also  be able to disinfect and prevent transmission of coronaviruses, including COVID-19.
It does so without leaving traces of chemicals you wouldn’t want your family members or pets to come in contact with.
Here’s an easy recipe for an all-natural, all-purpose cleaner:
Combine 20 drops of tea tree oil, 3/4 cup water, and a 1/2 cup  apple cider vinegar  in a spray bottle.
Shake well until thoroughly mixed.
Spray directly onto surfaces and wipe clean with a dry cloth.
Shake the bottle before each use to mix the tea tree oil with the other ingredients.

Soothe skin inflammation
Tea tree oil may help relieve inflamed skin.
A common form of skin irritation is  contact dermatitis , which occurs when your skin comes in contact with an allergen, such as nickel. Exposure to the allergen leads to irritated, itchy, and sometimes painful skin.
Applying tea tree oil may help reduce the severity of these symptoms.
In an  older study  comparing the effects of different treatments for contact dermatitis, tea tree oil was found to reduce symptoms by 40%, which was significantly more than standard medications applied to the skin.
Ocular demodicosis is inflammation around the eyes and eyelids related to Demodex mites. Tea tree oil  may help  treat this condition. It may help reduce the number of mites and reduce inflammation. However, additional research  is needed  to further support the effectiveness of tea tree oil for ocular demodicosis.
Use this recipe to relieve inflamed skin:
Combine 10 drops of tea tree oil with 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil and 1 tablespoon of melted coconut oil.
Mix well, and store in a sealed container.
Apply to the affected area up to twice per day until symptoms resolve.

Manage dandruff
Dandruff, or white flakes of dead skin that fall from the scalp, isn’t dangerous. However, it can be annoying and embarrassing for some people.
Adding tea tree oil to shampoo may help  reduce dandruff . This is thought to be related to its antifungal properties. And because it is slightly more acidic than your skin, it can help clear the dandruff scales.
In , tea tree oil shampoos were found to be effective in the lab at reducing the growth of Candida albicans (yeast), which often contributes to dandruff formation. However, additional studies with human participants are needed to evaluate this remedy.
To help  reduce dandruff , try adding a few drops of tea tree oil to a dollop of shampoo when washing your hair.

Treat athlete’s foot
Known medically as tinea pedis,  athlete’s foot  is a contagious fungal infection on the feet that can also spread to the toenails and hands. Symptoms can include:
peeling
cracking
blisters
skin discoloration
Antifungal medications are considered standard treatment for athlete’s foot. A  small amount of research  suggests that tea tree oil may be an effective alternative for relieving symptoms.
Here is a natural treatment to relieve the symptoms of athlete’s foot:
Combine 1/4 cup arrowroot powder, 1/4 cup baking soda, and 20–25 drops of tea tree oil.
Stir to combine and place in a covered container.
Apply to clean, dry feet twice per day.

Reduce mold on fruits and vegetables
Fresh products may be susceptible to the growth of gray mold, or Botrytis cinerea, particularly in warm, moist climates.
Research  suggests tea tree oil’s antifungal compounds terpinen-4-ol and 1,8-cineole may help reduce the growth of this mold in  fruits and vegetables .
To protect against  mold , add 5–10 drops of tea tree oil to water before rinsing your produce and drying it thoroughly.

Help deter lice
Some people use  tea tree oil to deter lice  or help treat an infection.
The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)  notes  that a small amount of research suggests it could be beneficial for lice.
Using  tea tree oil on your scalp  may suffocate lice, according to a  2022 review of research . The review notes that it is likely an effective treatment for head and body lice, especially for lice that have developed resistance to conventional treatments.

Precautions when using tea tree oil
Research suggests tea tree oil appears to be safe overall.
However, there are some things to be aware of before using it. Tea tree oil should not be ingested because it may be toxic if swallowed. Store it out of reach of children.
Tea tree oil may also cause  side effects  in some people. Prior to using tea tree oil for the first time, test 1 or 2 drops on a small area of your skin and wait 24 hours to see if any reaction occurs.
Some individuals  who use tea tree oil develop contact dermatitis. Likewise, people with sensitive skin may experience irritation when using undiluted tea tree oil. If your skin is sensitive, it’s best to mix tea tree oil with an equal or greater amount of olive oil, coconut oil, or almond oil.
Additionally, using tea tree oil or other essential oils on pets may be unsafe.

The bottom line
Tea tree oil may be an inexpensive natural alternative to chemical-based skin and nail treatments, personal care products, and disinfectants, among other things. However, larger controlled studies with human participants are still needed to determine its effectiveness for many common uses.
However, tea tree oil is not a magic cure-all and some people may experience skin irritation or allergic reactions after using it.
