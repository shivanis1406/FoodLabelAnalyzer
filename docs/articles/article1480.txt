Title: Are Peanuts Good for Weight Loss?

Peanuts are one of the world’s most popular legumes. They’re widely used as a healthy snack or dessert topping and are commonly found on the counter of any bar.
They come in many varieties, such as raw, roasted, boiled, salted, flavored, or plain. While peanuts are known for their high protein and fat content, you may wonder whether they can help you lose weight.
This article tells you whether peanuts are good for weight loss.

How peanuts affect weight loss
Peanuts may help you  lose weight  in many ways. In fact, many observational studies have shown that eating peanuts is associated with a healthy weight. Plus, they have been linked to lower rates of obesity ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
Unlike other snack foods that are high in simple carbs, peanuts are rich in healthy fats, proteins, and fiber, which take longer to digest ( 4 ).
One small study in 15 participants found that adding either whole peanuts or  peanut butter  to breakfast led to increased fullness and more stable blood sugar levels ( 5 ).
Simple carbohydrates are quickly absorbed into the bloodstream and lead to a quick spike in blood sugar followed by a rapid drop. This may cause you to feel hungry shortly after eating ( 6 ).
In contrast, peanuts are digested slowly and remain in your stomach longer. This helps you feel full and satisfied, allowing you to go longer between meals ( 4 ,  5 ).
Finally, peanuts require more chewing, which allows you to eat your food more slowly. As a result, this gives your body time to send fullness signals that may prevent you from overeating ( 4 ,  5 ).
Peanuts are rich in healthy fats known as  monounsaturated fatty acids  (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).
A diet high in these fats has been linked to reduced rates of inflammation, obesity, and chronic conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes ( 7 ,  8 ).
What’s more, nut consumption is associated with a lower risk of long-term weight gain. Some researchers theorize that the high unsaturated fat content in nuts may improve the body’s ability to use stored fat as energy. Still, more research is needed ( 9 ).
Though peanuts are high in calories, you may not absorb all the calories they provide.
When you eat peanuts, your teeth cannot break them down into a small enough size for full digestion, meaning you’re likely absorbing fewer calories while the rest is excreted through waste ( 10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13 ).
In a study in 63 men, participants ate whole peanuts, peanut butter,  peanut oil , or peanut flour. After comparing stool samples, those who ate whole peanuts had significantly higher amounts of fat in their stool, indicating a lower absorption of calories ( 13 ).
However, this doesn’t mean you should go overboard. Overeating calorie-dense foods, such as peanuts, can still lead to a calorie surplus and ultimately hinder your weight loss efforts.
For example, a 1/4-cup (146-gram) serving of peanuts contains 207 calories. Even if only 50–75% of the calories are absorbed, this is still 104–155 calories ( 14 ).
Therefore, it’s still important to be mindful of portion sizes to prevent calories from adding up. It’s best to stick to 1–2 handfuls per serving since they’re easy to overeat.
Research has shown that eating peanuts may help you manage your weight better. Peanuts are rich in fiber, protein, and healthy fats, which can help you feel full and prevent you from overeating.

Which ones to choose
It’s always best to select unflavored peanuts that have undergone minimal processing and don’t contain any added salt or other ingredients. Avoid candied peanuts, which contain a  sugar  coating and provide additional calories.
For extra fiber and antioxidants, enjoy peanuts with the skins on. The extra fiber can help increase fullness.
Boiled peanuts contain fewer calories than raw or roasted peanuts, with around 116 calories per 1/4 cup (146 grams), compared with 207 and 214 calories for raw and roasted peanuts, respectively ( 14 ,  15 ,  16 ).
However, boiled peanuts contain 50% less fat than raw and roasted peanuts, meaning they may not have the same filling effect. Therefore, choose the type you like the best and always be mindful of your portion sizes ( 14 ,  15 ,  16 ).
Select unshelled peanuts, as they take longer to open, which may prevent  mindless eating  and, ultimately, help you better manage your portion sizes and calorie intake.
Though peanut butter can be a healthy option, stick with natural peanut butter that contains no added salt, processed oils, or other ingredients.
Raw, roasted, and boiled peanuts are great options as a healthy snack. Be sure to pick peanuts that are free of added salt and flavoring, and always be mindful of your portion sizes.

The bottom line
Peanuts are full of nutrition and make for a  healthy snack .
They’re full of fiber, protein, and healthy fats, which can aid weight management by keeping you full longer.
For best results, choose raw, roasted, or boiled peanuts free of added salt and flavoring, and be mindful of your serving size.
Peanuts are an excellent alternative to other high calorie and processed snacks to help you with your weight loss goals.
