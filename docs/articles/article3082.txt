As children grow, it’s important for them to get enough vitamins and minerals to ensure optimal health.
Most kids get adequate amounts of nutrients from a balanced diet, but under certain circumstances, children may need to take vitamin or mineral supplements.
This article tells you everything you need to know about vitamins for kids, whether your child may need them, and the 7 best products to choose from, as well as a few others that are worth considering.

A note on vitamins for kids
Keep vitamins and supplements out of children's reach
Vitamins or supplements can be toxic to children in excess amounts. Gummy vitamins, especially, can be easy to overeat thanks to their candy-like form and flavor.
Discuss vitamin intake with older children
Talking with a child can help prevent overeating of vitamins and supplements.

Designed by parents looking for a lower sugar toddler multivitamin without artificial ingredients, Hiya offers a limited ingredient list and is free of added sugar. Instead, it’s naturally sweetened with monk fruit.
The multivitamin is also suitable for toddlers as young as 2 years, and it contains 16 essential nutrients your growing child needs, including vitamins A, C, D, and E; B vitamins; and zinc.
Hiya vitamins come in eco-friendly refillable jars, and packets of vitamins are delivered right to your doorstep each month.
According to the company, Hiya vitamins are third-party tested for heavy metals, allergens, and pathogens. However, they are not third-party tested to confirm potency.
“After seeing countless ads on social media for Hiya, I decided to give it a try. I was impressed by the initial packaging, which came with a refillable bright yellow bottle, a bag of that month’s vitamins, and stickers to decorate the bottle. Unfortunately, the stickers ended up all over my son’s chair and not the vitamin bottle, but it was still a nice touch.
“I was worried that he wouldn’t like the vitamins because they aren’t gummies and aren’t as sweet. However, he had zero issue making the swap and happily eats his one chewable each day.
“My only complaint is that I wish the company offered an omega-3 supplement that you could add to your monthly subscription.”

Many multivitamin supplements don’t contain iron, which is an important mineral  involved  in the production of healthy red blood cells.
Although most children can get enough iron from iron-rich foods, certain kids may be at a higher risk of iron deficiency, including picky eaters and those following a vegan or vegetarian diet.
These dissolvable tablets contain 18 vitamins and minerals, including iron, and are free of sugar and artificial colors and flavors. They are also vegan-friendly and can be used by children ages 2 and up.
Keep in mind that giving your infant or child too much iron can be dangerous. Make sure to have your child tested for iron deficiency before giving them an  iron-containing supplement .

This liquid supplement from Nordic Naturals provides 530 milligrams (mg) of omega-3 fatty acids, such as DHA and EPA, which  play a key role  in brain development.
Though DHA and EPA are found naturally in foods like oily fish, an omega-3 supplement might be a good option if seafood isn’t a regular part of your child’s diet.
Interestingly, some research suggests that omega-3 supplementation  could help manage  symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and  may even be linked  to improved cognition in children and adolescents.
This supplement is third-party tested for purity and is certified by Friend of the Sea (FOS) to help ensure sustainability. Additionally, a certificate of analysis (COA) is available for all Nordic Naturals products.
The company also offers an easy-to-chew softgel version of this supplement, which provides 250 mg of omega-3s per serving.
Healthline editor  Crystal Hoshaw  shared that the chewable form of Nordic Naturals Children’s DHA is her go-to pick for her son.
Hoshaw explained: “I love Nordic Naturals. It’s my go-to pick for fish oil and omega complex products. I trust it more than any brand on the market to be tested for mercury and provide high quality, potent, absorbable nutrients.
“My son never has trouble taking these, and when he gets bored of one flavor, we switch to another for a while to change things up.”

Best vitamin D drops
Dose   1 drop (0.028 mL) per day
Recommended age   infants through 12 months of age
Certifications   third-party tested for purity and potency, non-GMO tested
Price   $

Because breast milk typically doesn’t provide adequate amounts of vitamin D, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)  recommends  using a vitamin D supplement for breastfed and partially breastfed infants.

Formula-fed infants are also recommended to take a vitamin D supplement if they’re consuming fewer than  32 ounces  (oz), or about 1 liter (L), of formula per day.

Be sure to talk with a pediatrician if you’re unsure whether your baby needs vitamin D.

This is our overall pick for the  best vitamin D drops for babies  because it’s third-party tested and comes with a budget-friendly price tag, with enough servings to last a baby’s full first year.

It also contains just two ingredients — vitamin D and medium-chain triglyceride oil — and is free of GMOs and fillers.

Best allergen-free multivitamin
Dose   4 gummies per day
Certifications   NSF Contents Certified, Clean Label Project Purity Award, non-GMO tested
Price   $
This option from SmartyPants is one of the best gummy multivitamins for kids because it’s NSF Contents Certified, meaning that the contents of the vitamins match what’s on the label.
It’s also free of GMOs, synthetic colors, and artificial flavors. It may also be a good option for kids who need to avoid milk, eggs, nuts, soy, gluten, or wheat.
What it does contain: 15 essential nutrients, including vitamin D3 for bone and immune health, vitamin B12 for energy, omega-3 EPA and DHA for heart and brain health, iodine for thyroid support, and vitamin E for antioxidant support.
This gummy multivitamin is available in several flavors and is recommended for children over 4 years old. The company also offers a gummy supplement that’s suitable for toddlers ages 2 and 3.
Just keep in mind that these gummies contain 5 grams (g) of added sugar per serving (for the Kids formulation), which could contribute to  excessive sugar intake  throughout the day. Additionally, because kids may confuse gummy vitamins for candy, it’s essential to keep these vitamins stored safely and out of reach of kids.
“I purchased the toddler version of this supplement when my son was 2.
“Because he’s a picky eater, especially when it comes to fish, I liked that these gummies were comprehensive and included omega-3 DHA and EPA. I also appreciated being able to purchase them from Target.
“My son  loved  these gummies so much that I often found him trying to find the bottle so he could eat more. Because I was concerned about him getting ahold of the gummies and consuming (potentially) toxic amounts, I ultimately ended up switching him to Hiya chewable vitamins instead.”

Other products to consider
Besides the products listed above, there are many other high quality multivitamins for kids on the market.
If you still don’t see a supplement that meets your needs, here are a few additional products to consider:
OLLY Kids Multi + Probiotic Gummy :  Similar to a few others on our list, these gummy vitamins are designed for kids 2 years and older. In addition to 12 essential nutrients, they contain probiotics, which may be appropriate for some kids.
Garden of Life Kids Gummy :  These certified organic gummies are suitable for kids ages 4 years and up. While we like their comprehensive formulation, they are high in added sugar (4 g per 4-gummy serving), and some reviewers complain of an unpleasant smell.
Thorne Kids Multi+ :  These strawberry-kiwi dissolvable discs are formulated for kids ages 4-12 years and provide 15 essential vitamins and minerals. While they’re a good alternative to gummy vitamins, some reviewers complain that their kids don’t like the taste. These vitamins are also on the pricier side.

A comparison of the best vitamins for kids

How we chose the best vitamins for kids
There are several important factors to consider when choosing a supplement for your child, which is what we considered when choosing these products.
These products were selected based on the following criteria:
Ingredients:  We looked for vitamins that are free of fillers, artificial flavors, food dyes, and preservatives.  All products adhere to allowable health claims and labeling requirements, per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, and are manufactured in facilities that adhere to current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs) established by the FDA.
Credibility:  We chose products produced by medically credible companies that follow ethical, legal, and industry best standards and that provide objective measures of trust, such as having its supplements validated by third-party labs.
Dosage:  We included products that are specifically formulated for infants or kids.
Supplement form:  We included multivitamins in several forms, such as liquid, chewable, dissolvable, and gummy.
Reputable brands:  We selected products from well-known brands that adhere to strict manufacturing standards.

How to choose vitamins for kids
If your child follows a restrictive diet, cannot adequately absorb nutrients, or is a picky eater, they may benefit from taking vitamins.
Here are some tips on what to look for when selecting a supplement:
Third-party testing:  To ensure that the contents match the label, look for a product that has been tested by a third party, such as NSF International, United States Pharmacopeia (USP), ConsumerLab.com, Informed Choice, or the Banned Substances Control Group.
Kid-specific formulation:  Choose vitamins that are specifically made for kids. These products shouldn’t contain megadoses that exceed the daily nutrient needs of children.
Age-appropriate formulation:  Select a product that’s formulated for the specific age of your child. While many multivitamins are for kids 4 years and older, there are a few options for younger toddlers.
Nutrient needs:  Be sure to talk with your child’s pediatrician or a registered dietitian to determine which nutrients your kid’s multivitamin should contain.
Additives and sugar:  When possible, choose a multivitamin that contains minimal amounts of added sugar and artificial additives.
Always discuss supplements with a healthcare professional before giving them to your child.

Nutrient needs for kids
Kids’ nutrient needs depend on age, sex, size, growth, and activity level.
According to health experts, children ages 2-8 years need  1,000-1,400 calories  each day. Kids ages 9-13 years need 1,400-2,600 calories daily, depending on factors such as activity level.
In addition to including enough calories, a child’s diet should meet the following  Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) :
While the above nutrients are some of the most commonly discussed, they aren’t the only ones kids need.
Children need some amount of every vitamin and mineral for proper growth and health, but the exact amounts vary by age. Older children and teens need different amounts of nutrients than younger kids to support optimal health.
Kids need the same nutrients as adults but usually require smaller amounts.
As children grow, it’s vital for them to get adequate amounts of nutrients that  help build strong bones , such as calcium and vitamin D.
Moreover, iron, zinc, iodine,  choline , and vitamins A, B6, folate, B12, and D  are crucial  for brain development in early life.
Although kids may need smaller amounts of vitamins and minerals than adults do, they still need to get enough of these nutrients for proper growth and development.

Do kids need vitamin supplements?
In general, children who eat a balanced diet don’t need additional vitamin supplements. However, infants have different nutrient needs than children and  may require  certain supplements, such as vitamin D for  breastfed babies .
The  AAP  and the  USDA’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans  don’t recommend supplements over and above the Recommended Dietary Allowances for healthy children older than 1 year who eat a balanced diet.
Instead, they suggest that kids eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy products, and  protein  foods to obtain  adequate nutrition .
However, some may require supplements in specific circumstances, such as kids:
Following a vegetarian or vegan diet:  Plant-based diets may lead to  deficiencies  in calcium, iron, zinc, and vitamins B12 and D, especially if few or no animal products are consumed. A lack of these nutrients in children’s diets  can have  serious effects on their health, such as atypical growth and developmental delays.
With certain medical conditions:  Conditions like  celiac disease , inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ), cancer, and  cystic fibrosis  can affect nutrient absorption or increase nutrient needs. These children  may require  certain supplements to prevent disease-related malnutrition.
Who are picky eaters:   Picky eating  decreases the variety of foods in a child’s diet and may lead to low intakes of key nutrients like zinc, as suggested by some  studies . In such cases, testing for deficiencies can help determine if supplementation is necessary.

How to ensure your child is getting enough nutrients
Katie Drakeford , a registered dietitian and board certified specialist in pediatric nutrition, emphasizes providing a  variety of nutritious foods , including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
Some of the most common nutrient deficiencies seen in childhood include iron, calcium, and vitamin D. According to Drakeford, “incorporating iron-rich foods like meat, legumes, spinach, and fortified cereals can help prevent iron deficiency anemia.” She also recommends pairing these foods with vitamin C-rich options, such as strawberries, tomatoes, or citrus fruits, to enhance iron absorption.
Vitamin D and calcium are critical for bone health. While fortified foods like egg yolks, orange juice, and cereals provide vitamin D, Drakeford suggests that spending a few minutes outside can also boost levels of vitamin D. It’s important, though, to use sunscreen to prevent sunburn. For calcium, she advises including foods like milk, yogurt, cheese, and dark leafy greens in your child’s diet.
If you’re concerned about whether your child is getting enough nutrients, consult with their pediatrician or a registered dietitian before considering supplements.

Safety and risks associated with vitamins for kids
While supplements can be helpful in the right situation, it’s essential to approach them with caution.
There are risks associated with vitamin supplementation. Drakeford warns that “there are potential risks of vitamin toxicity, especially with the  fat-soluble vitamins ,” which are vitamins A, D, E, and K.
To ensure safety, Drakeford recommends selecting supplements from trusted brands that undergo third-party testing for quality, purity, and safety. “Vitamin and mineral dosing varies by age, so check the label carefully to ensure you are selecting an appropriate product for your child,” she adds.
Ultimately, Drakeford emphasizes that it’s best to rely on food first for getting vitamins and minerals. “Serve a variety of whole foods to ensure your child is being exposed to all of the different vitamins and minerals,” she recommends.
Some children may have increased needs and a supplement may help, but it’s best to consult your child’s healthcare professional before starting anything new.

Frequently asked questions about vitamins for kids
The type of vitamin supplements your child may need will depend on their age and any specific health concerns they have. Consult a pediatrician to see whether your child needs or would benefit from taking vitamins.
If a pediatrician recommends that your child take vitamins, look for quality brands that have been tested by a third party and are formulated with the appropriate doses of nutrients for kids (to avoid toxicity).

Outside of this age group, when you should start giving vitamins to kids depends on when they begin to have needs that warrant supplements. For instance, a child who has undergone surgery that affects nutrient absorption will likely need to start taking vitamins after the surgery.
Discuss with a pediatrician to confirm the best time to give vitamins to your child.

Children who eat a  balanced diet  generally don’t need to take vitamin supplements. But some kids may need them if they are at risk of deficiencies.
This would include children who follow a vegan or vegetarian diet, have had surgery affecting their intestines, have a medical condition that affects nutrient absorption, or are very picky eaters.

While vitamins and minerals shouldn’t be used to replace other treatments for behavioral problems, some research suggests that  certain supplements  could reduce symptoms of certain conditions that affect behavior, such as  ADHD .
For example,  one review  reported that omega-3 fatty acids may improve emotional difficulties, attention, and behavior in children and adolescents with ADHD. Similarly, a  2019 study  found that vitamin D supplementation could improve behavioral problems and reduce impulsivity in kids with ADHD.
A pediatrician can help determine whether supplementation may be beneficial for your child.

Gummy vitamins  can be a good option for kids, especially if they’re third-party tested for quality and safety. However,  some experts  question the marketing of gummy vitamins, pointing out that encouraging children to consume them like candy may send mixed messages about health.
Additionally, gummy vitamins may not be the best choice if you’re concerned about added sugars, as some gummies contain several grams per serving. Always check the label and consider sugar-free options if necessary.

The bottom line
Kids who eat a nutritious, balanced diet typically fulfill their nutrient needs through food.
Still, vitamin supplements may be necessary for  picky eaters , children who have a health condition that affects nutrient absorption or increases nutrient needs, or those who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet.
When providing vitamins to children, be sure to choose high quality brands that contain appropriate doses for kids and stick to the recommended dosage.
It’s also best to be cautious of giving your child supplements without documented evidence of a deficiency.
To ensure that your child is getting enough nutrients, try to offer them a balanced diet that includes a variety of foods and limits sweets and refined foods.
