Title: Alpha-Lipoic Acid: Weight Loss, Other Benefits and Side Effects

Alpha-lipoic acid may provide health benefits, including supporting weight loss and lowering blood sugar levels. You can get it through food and supplements with minimal side effects.
Alpha-lipoic acid has gained a lot of attention in recent years.
It’s an organic compound that acts as a powerful antioxidant in the body.
Your body produces alpha-lipoic acid naturally, but it’s also found in a variety of foods and as a dietary supplement.
Research suggests that it may play a role in weight loss, diabetes, and other health conditions.
However, many people wonder whether it’s effective.
This article reviews alpha-lipoic acid, its benefits, side effects, and recommended dosage.

What is alpha-lipoic acid?
Alpha-lipoic acid is an organic compound found in all human cells.
It’s made inside the mitochondrion — also known as the powerhouse of cells — where it helps enzymes turn nutrients into energy ( 1 ).
What’s more, it has powerful  antioxidant  properties.
Alpha-lipoic acid is both water- and fat-soluble, which allows it to work in every cell or tissue in the body. Meanwhile, most other antioxidants are either water- or fat-soluble ( 2 ).
For instance, vitamin C is only water-soluble, while vitamin E is only fat-soluble.
The antioxidant properties of alpha-lipoic acid have been linked to several benefits, including lower blood sugar levels,  reduced inflammation , slowed skin aging, and improved nerve function.
Humans only produce alpha-lipoic acid in small amounts. That’s why many turn to certain foods or supplements to optimize their intake.
Animal products like red meat and organ meats are great sources of alpha-lipoic acid, but plant foods like broccoli, tomatoes, spinach, and Brussels sprouts also contain it.
That said, supplements can pack up to 1,000 times more alpha-lipoic acid than food sources ( 3 ).

Alpha-lipoic acid and weight loss
Research has shown that alpha-lipoic acid may affect  weight loss  in several ways.
Animal studies indicate that it can reduce the activity of the enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is located in your brain’s hypothalamus ( 4 ,  5 ).
When AMPK is more active, it may increase feelings of hunger.
On the other hand, suppressing AMPK activity may increase the number of calories your body burns at rest. Thus, animals who took alpha-lipoic acid burned more calories ( 6 ,  7 ).
However, human studies show that alpha-lipoic acid only slightly impacts weight loss.
An analysis of 12 studies discovered that people who took an alpha-lipoic acid supplement lost an average of 1.52 pounds (0.69 kg) more than those taking a placebo over an average of 14 weeks ( 8 ).
In the same analysis, alpha-lipoic acid did not significantly affect waist circumference.
Another analysis of 12 studies found that people who took alpha-lipoic acid lost an average of 2.8 pounds (1.27 kg) more than those taking a placebo over an average of 23 weeks ( 9 ).
In short, it seems that alpha-lipoic acid has just a slight effect on weight loss in humans.
Though alpha-lipoic acid has properties that may promote weight loss, its overall effect in humans seems negligible.

Alpha-lipoic acid and diabetes
Diabetes affects more than 400 million adults worldwide ( 10 ).
A key feature of uncontrolled diabetes is high blood sugar levels. If left untreated, this can cause health problems, such as vision loss, heart disease, and kidney failure.
Alpha-lipoic acid has become popular as a potential aid for diabetes, as it’s been shown to  lower blood sugar levels  in both animals and humans.
In animal studies, it has lowered blood sugar levels by up to 64% ( 11 ,  12 ).
Other studies in adults with metabolic syndrome have shown that it may reduce  insulin resistance  and lower fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels.
Scientists believe that alpha-lipoic acid helps lower blood sugar by promoting processes that can remove fat that has accumulated in muscle cells, which otherwise makes insulin less effective ( 13 ).
Moreover, alpha-lipoic acid may lower the risk of diabetes complications.
It’s proven to ease symptoms of nerve damage and lower the risk of diabetic retinopathy (eye damage) that can occur with uncontrolled diabetes ( 14 ,  15 ,  16 ).
It’s believed that this effect is due to the powerful antioxidant properties of alpha-lipoic acid ( 17 ).
Though alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to aid blood sugar control, it’s not considered a complete treatment for diabetes. If you have diabetes and want to try alpha-lipoic acid, it’s best to first talk with your doctor, as it may interact with your medications.
Alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to reduce insulin resistance, improve blood sugar control, ease symptoms of nerve damage, and lower the risk of diabetic retinopathy.

Other health benefits
Alpha-lipoic acid has been linked to a variety of other health benefits.
Research has shown that alpha-lipoic acid may help fight signs of skin aging.
In one human study, scientists found that applying a cream containing alpha-lipoic acid to the skin reduced fine lines, wrinkles, and skin roughness with no side effects ( 18 ).
When alpha-lipoic acid is applied to the skin, it incorporates itself into the skin’s inner layers and offers antioxidant protection against the sun’s harmful UV radiation ( 19 ,  20 ).
Moreover, alpha-lipoic acid raises the levels of other antioxidants, such as  glutathione , which help protect against skin damage and may reduce signs of aging ( 21 ,  22 ).
Memory loss  is a common concern among older adults.
It’s believed that damage from oxidative stress plays a critical role in memory loss ( 23 ).
Because alpha-lipoic acid is a powerful antioxidant, studies have examined its ability to slow the progression of disorders characterized by memory loss, such as Alzheimer’s disease.
Both human and lab studies suggest that alpha-lipoic acid slows the progression of Alzheimer’s disease by neutralizing free radicals and suppressing inflammation ( 24 ,  25 ,  26 ).
However, only a handful of studies have investigated alpha-lipoic acid and memory loss-related disorders. More research is needed before alpha-lipoic acid can be recommended for treatment.
Research has shown that alpha-lipoic acid promotes healthy nerve function.
In fact, it’s been found to slow the progression of  carpal tunnel syndrome  in its early stages. This condition is characterized by numbness or tingling in the hand caused by a pinched nerve ( 27 ).
Moreover, taking alpha-lipoic acid before and after surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome has been shown to improve recovery outcomes ( 28 ).
Studies have also discovered that alpha-lipoic acid may ease symptoms of diabetic neuropathy, which is nerve pain caused by uncontrolled diabetes ( 14 ,  15 ).
Chronic inflammation  is linked to several diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
Alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to lower several markers of inflammation.
In an analysis of 11 studies, alpha-lipoic acid significantly lowered levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) in adults with high levels of CRP ( 29 ).
In test-tube studies, alpha-lipoic acid has reduced markers of inflammation, including NF-kB, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, and IL-6 ( 30 ,  31 ,  32 ,  33 ).
Heart disease  is responsible for one in four deaths in America ( 34 ).
Research from a combination of lab, animal, and human studies has shown that the antioxidant properties of alpha-lipoic acid may lower several heart disease risk factors.
First, antioxidant properties allow alpha-lipoic acid to neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative stress, which is linked to damage that can increase heart disease risk ( 35 ).
Second, it’s been shown to improve endothelial dysfunction — a condition in which blood vessels cannot dilate properly, which also raises the risks of heart attack and stroke ( 36 ,  37 ).
What’s more, a review of studies found that taking an alpha-lipoic acid supplement  lowered triglyceride  and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels in adults with metabolic disease ( 13 ).
Alpha-lipoic acid has strong antioxidant properties, which may reduce inflammation and skin aging, promote healthy nerve function, lower heart disease risk factors, and slow the progression of memory loss disorders.

Side effects
Alpha-lipoic acid is generally considered safe with little to no side effects.
In some cases, people may experience mild symptoms like  nausea , rashes, or itching.
However, research shows that adults can take up to 2,400 mg without harmful side effects ( 38 ).
Higher doses are not recommended, as there’s no evidence that they provide extra benefits.
Furthermore, animal research has found that extremely high doses of alpha-lipoic acid may promote oxidation, alter liver enzymes, and place strain on liver and breast tissue ( 38 ,  39 ).
To date, very few studies have looked at the safety of alpha-lipoic acid in children and pregnant women. These populations should not take it unless advised to do so by their healthcare provider.
If you have diabetes, consult your healthcare provider before taking alpha-lipoic acid, as it may interact with other medicines that help lower blood sugar levels.
Alpha-lipoic acid is generally safe with little to no side effects. In some instances, people may experience mild symptoms, such as nausea, rashes, or itching.

How to take alpha-lipoic acid
Alpha-lipoic acid is found naturally in several foods.
Good sources of alpha-lipoic acid include ( 3 ):
red meats
organ meats  like liver, heart, kidney, etc.
broccoli
spinach
tomatoes
Brussels sprouts
potatoes
green peas

Alpha-lipoic acid is also available as a supplement and can be found in many health stores and  online . Supplements can contain up to 1,000 times more alpha-lipoic acid than foods ( 3 ).
Alpha-lipoic supplements are best taken on an empty stomach, as certain foods can lower the acid’s bioavailability ( 40 ).
Though there is no set dosage, most evidence suggests that 300–600 mg is sufficient and safe. Alternatively, you can follow the instructions on the back of the bottle.
People with diabetic complications or cognitive disorders may require more alpha-lipoic acid. In such cases, it’s best to ask your healthcare practitioner how much is most effective.
Alpha-lipoic acid is naturally present in red meats, organ meats, and several plants. It’s also available as a dietary supplement sold in health stores or online.

The bottom line
