By providing products such as organic baby foods and family-style meals, meal delivery services can help make mealtime easier for parents who are short on time.
Healthline nutrition editor and registered dietitian Kelli McGrane reviewed more than 15 of the most popular meal delivery services for kids. Next, along with her sons, she tried 11 of those companies, as well as a handful of family-friendly meal kit delivery services.
See which companies ultimately made her list of the seven best meal delivery services for kids and families.

How we chose
When selecting the best meal delivery services for kids and families, we considered several factors:
Nutrition:  We looked for services offering nutritionally balanced meals with plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. We also prioritized services that limit the amounts of added sugar and salt in their products.
Ingredient quality and freshness:  We chose services that use mostly whole food ingredients and are free from, or contain minimal amounts of, artificial additives. We also paid attention to the freshness of the products during taste testing.
Products offered:  We included a wide range of product types, from pouches and snack bars to full meals.
Ease of preparation:  We prioritized services offering easy-to-prepare meals.
Taste:  A mom and toddler taste-tested every service’s offerings.
Texture:  We included services to suit a wide range of texture needs and preferences, so you’re likely to find one that works for you whether you have an infant, toddler, or school-aged kid.
Disclaimer:  All the services tested below were   provided to our tester for free. All opinions are our own.
In addition to being toddler-tested and mom-approved, every service on our list has been reviewed by registered dietitians and  vetted  to ensure that it aligns with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being.
Each service in this article:
complies with U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) food safety and manufacturing regulations
uses a trusted shipper to handle its food products
lists all ingredients, allergens, and nutrition facts on its website or product packaging
promotes a healthy approach to well-being
doesn’t make unsupported health claims on its website or marketing materials

Healthline tester
There’s no denying that meal subscription services aren’t cheap. To ensure that we’re recommending services that are worth the money, we put each one to the test.
During the initial round of testing, Healthline nutrition editor Kelli McGrane, MS, RD, and her son (who was 18 months old at the time) tried more than 10 of the most popular meal delivery services for kids and families to find the ones that are kid-, mom-, and dietitian-approved.
Most recently, McGrane tested an additional service, this time wither her 8-month-old and, now, 3-year-old.

Healthline’s picks of the best meal delivery services for kids


Best meal kit for busy families
Price per serving   $9.99 to $13.95
Delivery area   contiguous United States
Shipping   $9.99 to $11.99
Recommended age:  children and adults
Types of meals:  meal kits, oven-ready meals, and prepared meals

Known for its line of easy-to-prepare meal kits and oven-ready entrees,  Home Chef  is a great option for busy families who could use some help getting homemade meals on the table.

The service offers multiple meal plans to choose from, including its new Family Menu. This meal plan features a rotating menu of 10 or more family-friendly recipes, all of which include fresh ingredients and are designed to feed a family of 4.

While a few vegetarian and calorie- and carb-conscious options are available, Home Chef’s Family Menu doesn’t cater to specialized diets or allergies.

Every Home Chef meal kit is delivered in a recyclable cardboard box that contains insulated liners and gel packs to keep your food cool during transport.

Most Home Chef meal kits start at $7.99 per serving. However, with the Family Menu, prices start as low as $3.77 per serving, making it also one of the most affordable services for families.


I tried three recipes from Home Chef’s family menu, including the One-Pan Pork and Broccoli Stir-Fry, One-Sheet Butter Cracker-Crusted Chicken Cutlet, and Cheesy Beef Enchilada Bake.

Overall, all of the recipes were incredibly easy to make — my now 2.5-year-old was even able to help — and each dish was very flavorful. What’s more, despite being designed for four people, we had enough leftovers to easily feed two to three adults for lunch the next day.

My only complaint is that I wish two of the recipes had larger servings of vegetables. Instead, I ended up adding avocado and fresh tomato to the enchilada dish and a bag of frozen mixed vegetables to the stir-fry.

Shipping   $8.99
Recommended age:  babies, toddlers, and kids from 10 months to 12 years old
Types of meals:  smoothies, snack bites, fresh and fully prepared kids’ meals, finger foods, and crustless sandwiches

From finger foods for toddlers to pasta dishes for older kids,  Nurture Life  is one of the best meal delivery services for kids and toddlers. The meals are designed by registered dietitians to be nutritionally balanced and to include at least one serving of  vegetables  per meal.

What’s more, Nurture Life is a good option for parents who are short on time, as the meals come fully prepared and can be reheated in 2 minutes or less.

All Nurture Life entrees are made in a facility that’s free of peanuts and tree nuts, and customers can use the dietary filter option to find meals that are free of wheat, eggs, milk, soy, fish, gluten, sesame, coconut, or pork. However, cross contamination is still possible.

The meals are made using organic produce and whole grains, antibiotic-free animal proteins, and sustainably sourced seafood.

Meals are shipped in insulated boxes and last up to 1 week in the fridge or 90 days in the freezer. Except for the seals and the interior of the freezer gel packs, all the packaging is recyclable.


Nurture Life scored major points for being easy to reheat and nutritionally balanced, with every meal containing a vegetable, a whole grain or starchy vegetable, and a protein.

My son seemed to be a fan of the textures and flavors of each meal. He particularly loved the smoothies, all of which are free of added sugar and contain a blend of fruits and vegetables.

His other favorites were the egg bites with sweet potato and the mac and cheese with hidden cauliflower.

Designed by chefs and neonatal nutritionists, Little Spoon meals cater to a child’s developmental stages, offering purees for babies (6 months+), bite-sized finger foods for babies transitioning to solids, and balanced meals for toddlers and bigger kids.

The extensive menu allows you to filter by dietary needs, preferences, and even protein or grain type. That being said, it’s important to note that meals are processed in facilities that process major allergens, so this still may not be suitable for littles with serious allergies.

A standout feature of Little Spoon is its approach to  picky eating . Many plates contain hidden veggies to help ensure little ones are getting plenty of nutrients, but also include a present vegetable to help encourage the healthy habit of  eating vegetables .

With Little Spoon, you choose the meals you want and the frequency of delivery (weekly or biweekly). You can also add snacks to your order, including options like soft baked oat bars with hidden veggies and chickpea-based crunchy snack loops.

Despite my best efforts to expose him to a variety of foods at a young age, my 3-year-old is firmly into the picky eating stage of toddlerhood. Because of this, I was excited to try Little Spoon, which includes both hidden and visible vegetables.
My toddler loved the pasta dishes and even took several bites of the various veggie-based bites. However, his favorite items were the smoothies, particularly the Tropical Greens pouch. He also enjoyed the chickpea-based crunchy snack loops and the oat-based snack bars, both of which contain hidden veggies.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, my 8-month-old happily gobbles down anything we give him. So, it wasn’t a surprise that he loved all of the Babyblends and the Biteable meals we tried. As a busy mom, I was very grateful to have quick and easy (and sodium-free) balanced meals to give him.
My only complaint with Little Spoon is that there isn’t an option for one-time purchases. Having yet another subscription isn’t in our budget at the moment. However, there are a few meals and snacks that I’d like to order again from time to time.

Best for infants on purees

Price per serving   $4.98–$7.07

Recommended age:  infants 4–12+ months
Types of meals:  pureed meals

Square Baby is a  baby food  company that was created by a registered dietitian and genetic counselor.

The company offers meals for various stages, including single-ingredient meals for babies 4 months old and up, and “square meals,” which contain a mix of ingredients, for infants over 6 to 8 months of age.

You can filter the menu to find items suitable for your child’s age, as well as options that are smooth or chunky, dairy-free, gluten-free, vegan, or vegetarian.

Meals are also sorted by their specific source of protein and potential health benefits, making it easy to find meals that are rich in probiotics, fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, or sprouted grains.

The service also offers an assortment of foods that contain common allergens to help you  introduce these foods  into your child’s diet early. However, keep in mind that this may not be suitable for infants who have a diagnosis of a food allergy.

The items are made using high quality organic ingredients and packaged in reusable or recyclable containers. What’s more, Square Baby meals are third-party tested by the  Clean Label Project  to ensure that they’re free of heavy metals, pesticide residues, and over 400 other contaminants.


The meals arrived frozen and were easy to thaw in the fridge or microwave. They were also compactly packaged, so they didn’t take up valuable refrigerator real estate.

Because the purees are designed as meals for younger kids, I served my 18-month-old the purees as snacks and side dishes. While he took bites of the Mango Coconut Chicken and the Minty Greens, he particularly enjoyed the Peachy Oatmeal and the Beet Berry.

I wish I had tried this service when my son was younger, as I think it’s a great way to expose infants to new flavors while ensuring they’re getting a nutritionally balanced meal.
Note:  When I tried the service, they were in the middle of changing their packaging. Square Baby meals now come in reusable glass jars.

Tiny Organics specializes in finger foods that are designed to encourage your little one to become an adventurous eater. The dishes offer a variety of textures and flavors and are created by a team of chefs and neonatal nutritionists to suit your child’s  developmental milestones .

All Tiny Organics meals are plant-based, nutritionally balanced, made with certified organic ingredients, and free of  added sugar  and salt. Instead, meals are flavored with real fruits and vegetables, whole grains, herbs, and natural seasonings.

In addition to their original Tiny Meals (designed for babies 6 months and older), the company’s lineup also includes Tiny Purees and Tiny Toddler Meals.

The meals are flash-frozen and can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months. They’re easy to reheat in the microwave or on the stove.

Tiny Organics offers 12- and 24-pack meal subscriptions, with recurring deliveries at 1-, 2-, or 4-week intervals.


Tiny Organics is one of my favorite meal delivery services for older babies and younger toddlers because the ingredient lists are impressively short and the meals contain a good variety of seasonings and ingredients.

I also appreciate that the meals can be frozen for up to 3 months and take up very little freezer space.

My son took bites from every meal that we tried. He particularly loved the Bananas Foster, Coconut Curry, and Oat Em Gee.

Serenity Kids is a meal delivery service that offers a variety of meat- and veggie-based baby food pouches, along with grain-free puffs and toddler formula.

The products have been third-party tested for heavy metals by the  Clean Label Project , which has determined that the company meets the standards for the Purity and Pesticide Free Award.

All items are also free of gluten, nuts, grains, soy, and corn. However, items are manufactured in a facility that also processes these ingredients, so cross contamination is possible.

The pouches are shelf-stable and free of preservatives. Additionally, all pouches are made with organic vegetables, and the meat is sourced from small family farms that practice regenerative agriculture to support sustainability.

Though the pouches are not curbside recyclable, Serenity Kids offers a free recycling program, making it easy to collect and mail back the containers once you’re finished.


Serenity Kids is one of my favorite brands for pouches because it prioritizes herbs, vegetables, healthy fats, and even meats, making the pouches less sweet than those from other brands.

My son enjoyed pretty much all the vegetable pouches, and I appreciated having a stash of quick and easy veggie-packed snacks on hand. The grain-free puffs were also handy for keeping him busy at restaurants.

The only items he didn’t like were the meat pouches (even now at 2 years old he’s still not much of a meat eater). However, I gave the rest to my friend, and her kiddo gobbled them up.

Price per serving   pouches and smoothies start at $3.05 each, Smart Bars cost $1.02 per serving
Shipping   $4.99, or free for orders over $45
Recommended age:  infants and toddlers 4 months and older
Types of meals:  pouches, bars
Founded by a neurosurgeon and developmental neurobiologist, Cerebelly offers an assortment of purees, smoothie-inspired pouches, and bars with added nutrients to  support brain health .

In addition to being certified organic, Cerebelly is the first shelf-stable baby food to receive the Clean Label Project Purity Award, which means the food has been tested for heavy metals and contaminants.

Cerebelly also offers an online quiz, which asks about your child’s age and developmental milestones to provide specific product recommendations to fit their needs.

You can purchase a six-pack of your favorite varieties or a bundle with several different products to try. All products are free of gluten and major food allergens.

Plus, Cerebelly has a free recycling program, which allows you to print a shipping label and mail your plastic pouches so they can be recycled.


Finding kid-friendly  snack bars  that are flavorful without being high in added sugar is surprisingly difficult, which is why I was very excited about Cerebelly Smart Bars.
I also appreciate that they don’t melt and aren’t super crumbly, which means they’re ideal for park days or zoo trips. Just keep in mind that the bars are a bit chewier and not as soft — or as sweet — as some others on the market.
While my son loved the bars initially, after 2 months of regularly weaving them into his snack rotation, he started to prefer chewier, date- and nut-based bars over these ones.
I was also impressed by both the nutrition stats and the ingredient combinations offered by the pouches. My son isn’t always a huge fan of pouches, but he really liked this company’s smoothie-inspired line.

A comparison of the best meal delivery services for kids
Here’s a quick look at how our top picks compare:

How to choose
When looking for a kid-friendly meal delivery service, there are several factors to consider:
Age-appropriate meals:  Some services specialize in purees for infants, while others cater to only school-aged kids. Be sure to choose a service that’s appropriate for your child’s age and developmental stage.
Recipe variety:  It’s a good idea to browse each service’s menu to make sure you choose a company with recipes that fit your child’s food preferences.
Products offered:  Are you looking for help at mealtime, or do you simply need a few healthy snacks to stash in your kid’s backpack? Knowing the types of products you’re looking for will help narrow down your options.
Food allergies:  If your kid has a food allergy, make sure to choose a service that has strict standards in place to reduce the risk of cross-contamination.
Nutritional quality:  Because proper nutrition plays an essential role in development, consider a service featuring meals that are developed by experts to meet the specific nutritional needs of children.
Ingredient quality:  Look for services that prioritize whole-food ingredients and limit the use of added sugar, salt,  dyes , and artificial additives.
Prep time:  If you’re short on time, you may want to choose a service that provides microwavable prepared meals rather than meal kits.
Packaging:  Because most  meal delivery services  come with a lot of packaging, you may prefer a company that uses mostly recyclable, reusable, or biodegradable materials.
Price:  Make sure to have a budget in mind when looking at meal delivery services. Also, many companies offer discounts on bulk orders or monthly subscriptions.

However, for babies and younger toddlers, a service like Tiny Organics might be better.

The bottom line
If you’re looking for a healthy meal delivery service to save time on preparing meals for your kids or family, be sure to choose a company that prioritizes quality ingredients, nutritional content, and  kid-friendly recipes .
Because babies and toddlers reach developmental milestones at different rates, it’s important to consult your pediatrician if you have any concerns about whether a meal delivery service is age-appropriate for younger children.
