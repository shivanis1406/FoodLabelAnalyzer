Title: The 10 Best Foods That Are High in Zinc

Food sources of zinc include meat, shellfish, and dairy, among others. You can also get moderate amounts of zinc from some plant-based sources.
The mineral zinc is required for the functions of over 300 enzymes. It is involved in many vital processes in your body, including metabolizing nutrients, maintaining your immune system, and growing and repairing body tissues ( 1 ).
Your body doesn’t store zinc, so you must eat enough daily to meet your daily requirements.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends that males 19 years and older aim for 11 milligrams (mg) of zinc daily and that females in this age group consume 8 mg. They recommend pregnant people consume 11 mg daily while people who are breastfeeding or chestfeeding consume 12 mg ( 2 ).
Some people are at risk of zinc deficiency, including ( 2 ,  3 ):
children
older adults
pregnant people
people who are breastfeeding or chestfeeding
A nutrient-dense, balanced diet with zinc-rich foods should satisfy most people’s needs.
Here are 10 of the best sources of  zinc .

1. Meat
Meat  is an excellent source of zinc.
Red meat  is a great source, but all kinds of meat have zinc, including beef, lamb, and pork.
A 100-gram (3.5-ounce) serving of raw ground beef contains 4.79 mg of zinc, which is about 44% of the Daily Value (DV) for males and 60% of the DV for females ( 4 ).
One serving also provides 176 calories, 20 grams of protein, and 10 grams of fat. Plus, it’s a great source of many other essential nutrients, like iron, B vitamins, and creatine ( 4 ).
It’s worth noting that eating large amounts of red meat, especially  processed meat , has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and some cancers ( 5 ).
However, if you keep your intake of processed meats to a minimum and consume unprocessed red meats as part of a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and fiber, this probably isn’t something you need to worry about.
Meat is an excellent source of zinc. A 100-gram serving of raw ground beef provides 44%–60% of the Daily Value (DV).

2. Shellfish
Shellfish  are healthy, low calorie sources of zinc.
Oysters contain particularly high amounts, with six medium oysters providing 33 mg, or 300% of the DV for males and 413% for females ( 6 ).
Other types of shellfish contain less zinc than oysters but are still good sources.
Alaska king crab contains 7.62 mg per 100 grams (3.5 oz.), which is 69% of the DV for males and 95% for females ( 7 ).
Smaller shellfish like  shrimp  and mussels are also good sources. Both contain nearly 15% of the DV for males and around 20% for females in a 100-gram (3.5-oz) serving ( 8 ,  9 ).
If you’re pregnant, thoroughly cook shellfish before eating it to minimize your risk of food poisoning.
Shellfish like oysters, crab, shrimp, and mussels can all contribute to your daily zinc intake.

3. Legumes
Legumes  like chickpeas, lentils, and beans contain substantial amounts of zinc.
In fact, 100 grams (3.5 oz) of cooked lentils contain 12% of the DV for males and 16% for females ( 10 ).
However, legumes also contain phytates. These antinutrients inhibit the absorption of zinc and other minerals, which means zinc from legumes isn’t as well absorbed as from animal products ( 11 ).
Despite this, legumes can be an important source of zinc for people following vegan or vegetarian diets. They are also an excellent source of protein and fiber that you can easily add to soups, stews, and salads.
Heating, sprouting, soaking, or fermenting legumes and other plant sources of zinc can increase the mineral’s bioavailability ( 11 ).
Legumes contain high amounts of zinc. They also contain phytates, which are antinutrients that reduce its absorption. Processing methods like heating, sprouting, soaking, or fermenting can help improve the bioavailability of zinc.

4. Seeds
Seeds  are a nutrient-rich addition to your diet and can help increase your zinc intake.
For example, 3 tablespoons (30 grams) of hemp seeds contain 27% of the DV for males and 37% for females ( 12 ).
Other seeds containing significant amounts of zinc include pumpkin, squash, and sesame seeds ( 13 ,  14 ).
In addition to boosting your zinc intake, seeds contain fiber, healthy fats, vitamins, and other minerals.
Eating them as part of a balanced diet has also been linked to various health benefits, including reduced blood pressure and cholesterol ( 15 ,  16 ).
To get more seeds into your diet, try adding them to salads, soups, yogurts, or other foods.
Some seeds like hemp, pumpkin, squash, and sesame seeds contain significant amounts of zinc. They’re also a good source of fiber, healthy fats, vitamins, and other minerals, making them a beneficial addition to your diet.

5. Nuts (and peanuts)
Nuts like pine nuts, cashews, and almonds can boost your zinc intake. Peanuts, while technically a legume, also provide zinc.
Nuts contain fiber, beneficial fats, and several other vitamins and minerals.
Cashews are a good choice if you’re looking for a nut high in zinc. A 1-ounce (28.35-gram) serving contains 15% of the DV for males and 21% for females ( 17 ).
Nuts may also help reduce risk factors for some diseases, including cancer and heart disease ( 18 ,  19 ).
Moreover, people who eat nuts and peanuts tend to live longer than those who don’t, so they may benefit your longevity ( 20 ,  21 ).
Nuts (and peanuts) are a healthy and convenient snack that can boost your intake of zinc and many other nutrients.

6. Dairy
Dairy products  provide a host of nutrients, including zinc.
Cheese and milk are two notable sources. They contain high amounts of bioavailable zinc, which means your body can absorb most of the zinc in these items.
For example, 1 ounce (28 grams) of sharp cheddar cheese contains 10% of the DV for males and 13% for females. A single cup (244 grams.) of whole milk contains 9% of the DV for males and 13% for females ( 22 ,  23 ).
Dairy products also provide several other important nutrients for  bone health , including protein, calcium, and vitamin D.
Dairy products are good sources of zinc. Your body can absorb most of the zinc in dairy.

7. Eggs
Eggs  contain a moderate amount of zinc and can help you meet your daily target.
For example, one large egg contains 5% of the DV for males and 7% for females ( 24 ).
One large egg also provides 77.5 calories, 6.3 grams of protein, 5.3 grams of healthy fats, and other vitamins and minerals, including B vitamins, selenium, and choline.
One large egg contains 5%–7% of the DV for zinc, as well as many other nutrients, including protein, healthy fats, B vitamins, selenium, and choline.

8. Whole grains
Whole grains  like wheat, quinoa, rice, and oats contain some zinc.
Like legumes, grains contain phytates, which bind to zinc and reduce its absorption ( 11 ).
Whole grains contain more phytates than refined grains and will likely provide less zinc. However, they’re considerably better for your health.
They’re also a good source of many important nutrients, like:
fiber
B vitamins
magnesium
iron
phosphorus
manganese
selenium
Eating whole grains has been linked to a longer life and many other health benefits, including a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease ( 25 ,  26 ,  27 ).
Whole grains can provide zinc in your diet. The zinc they provide may not be absorbed as well as other sources, due to the presence of phytates.

9. Some vegetables
In general,  fruits  and  vegetables  aren’t the best sources of zinc.
Some vegetables contain reasonable amounts and can contribute to your daily needs, especially if you don’t eat meat.
For example, a large regular potato contains 1.08 mg, or 10% of the DV for males and 14% for females. A large sweet potato contains 0.576 mg, or 5% of the DV for males and 7% for females ( 28 ,  29 ).
Other vegetables like kale and green beans contain less, with 100 grams (3.5 oz) of both vegetables containing nearly 2.5% of the DV for males and nearly 3.5% for females ( 30 ,  31 ).
Although they don’t contain a lot of zinc, vegetables are still an essential part of the diet. A veggie-rich diet has been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer ( 32 ,  33 ).
Most vegetables aren’t good sources of zinc. But some contain moderate amounts and can help you meet your daily needs.

10. Dark chocolate
Dark chocolate  contains reasonable amounts of zinc.
A 100-gram (3.5-ounce) bar of 70%–85% dark chocolate contains 3.31 mg of zinc, or 30% of the DV for males and 41% for females ( 34 ).
One hundred grams of dark chocolate also contains 24 grams of sugar and 598 calories. It’s a high calorie food.
While you may get some added nutrients with this treat, it’s not a food you should rely on as a primary source of zinc.
Dark chocolate can be a good source of zinc, but it’s also high in calories and sugar. It’s best to eat dark chocolate in moderation and not as a primary source of zinc.
