Potential benefits of a Mediterranean diet
The Mediterranean diet has been linked to a long list of health benefits.
Research  has not confirmed that following a Mediterranean diet will cause a person to lose weigh. However, studies have suggested it may be a good long-term option for people seeking to manage their weight.
Data for people who followed the diet for 5 years indicated they were less likely to gain excess weight than those on other diets.
Benefits include:
plenty of variety means the diet is not restrictive and therefore easy to maintain
high fiber levels means a person is more likely to feel satisfied for longer and less likely to snack
the healthy fats are less likely to cause heart problems linked to obesity
The  American Heart Association  recommends the Mediterranean diet as an evidence-driven options for preventing cardiovascular disease and stroke.
In 2021, for instance, some  researchers  compared the effects of the Mediterranean diet with those of a low fat diet. They concluded that the Mediterranean diet was more effective at slowing the progression of plaque buildup in the arteries. Plaque buildup is a major risk factor for heart disease.
The authors of another  study  said the Mediterranean diet could support heart health by lowering blood pressure.
The Mediterranean diet  may help  stabilize blood sugar levels and protect against type 2 diabetes.
Studies have suggested that it may:
reduce  fasting blood sugar levels
improve levels of  hemoglobin A1C , a marker used to measure long-term glucose levels
decrease  insulin resistance, which stops the body from using insulin to regulate blood sugar levels effectively
The Mediterranean diet may benefit brain health and prevent cognitive decline as you get older.
One  study  found a possible link between following a Mediterranean diet, improved memory, and reductions in several risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease.
A large  review  also linked the Mediterranean diet to improvements in cognitive function, memory, attention, and processing speed in healthy older adults.
