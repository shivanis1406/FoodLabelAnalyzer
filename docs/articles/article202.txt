Title: Radicchio: Nutrition, Benefits, and Uses

Radicchio ⁠— also known as  Cichorium intybus  and Italian chicory ⁠— is a type of leafy chicory featuring dark reddish-purple leaves and white veins.
Though commonly mistaken for red cabbage or lettuce, radicchio has a distinctly bitter taste that goes well with many Italian dishes. It’s a traditional ingredient in the Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes whole plant foods ( 1 ).
You may wonder how else radicchio differs from other more common leafy vegetables like cabbage and lettuce, and if it’s worth adding to your diet.
This article reviews the nutrition, health benefits, and uses of radicchio.

Origin and nutrition
Radicchio belongs to the  Asteraceae  family alongside  dandelions  and other chicory vegetables like Belgian endive.
Though it looks similar to red or purple cabbage, radicchio has a distinct bitter or spicy taste, which becomes less pungent if cooked.
There are several varieties, with Chioggia being most widely available. Other varieties are Treviso, which is sweeter and longer in shape, and Castelfranco, which is green with red speckles. The latter two may be difficult to find ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
Much of the radicchio eaten around the world is imported from the Mediterranean region, but today, it is also grown commercially in other areas like California ( 5 ).
Like most  leafy greens , radicchio contains few calories but offers several important vitamins and minerals.
A 2-cup (80-gram) serving of raw radicchio has the following nutritional composition ( 6 ):
Calories:  20
Protein:  1.2 grams
Fat:  0 grams
Carbs:  4 grams
Fiber:  1 gram
Iron:  3% of the Daily Value (DV)
Zinc:  5% of the DV
Copper:  30% of the DV
Phosphorus:  3% of the DV
Potassium:  5% of the DV
Vitamin K:  170% of the DV
Vitamin C:  7% of the DV
Vitamin B6:  3% of the DV
Radicchio is a rich source of vitamin K. Compared with raw red cabbage, a serving of radicchio contains smaller amounts of most micronutrients, but in return, it has twice as much zinc and copper ( 6 ,  7 ).
Radicchio is a bitter variety of chicory often used in Italian dishes. While low in calories, radicchio is high in zinc, copper, and vitamin K.

Health benefits
The historical medicinal uses of  Cichorium intybus  include wound healing as well as treating  diarrhea , maintaining heart health, and managing blood sugar ( 8 ).
Today, research supports that radicchio offers potential health benefits, which appear to be largely due to powerful plant compounds ( 8 ).
Antioxidants are compounds in plant foods that protect your cells from free-radical damage. High levels of free radicals in your body may lead to oxidative stress and associated illnesses like cancer, heart disease, digestive conditions, and Alzheimer’s ( 9 ).
The distinctive color of radicchio comes from pigmented antioxidants called anthocyanins. Anthocyanins may benefit intestinal health and repair cell damage caused by  oxidative stress  ( 10 ,  11 ).
One test-tube study found that the antioxidants in radicchio — especially from organic varieties — were particularly effective in attacking a common liver cancer cell called Hep-G2 ( 12 ).
Another test-tube study observed that the antioxidant content and protective benefits of Treviso radicchio were significantly higher in extracts from the red parts of the leaves compared with extracts from the whole leaves ( 10 ).
What’s more, a third test-tube study discovered that antioxidants from red chicory protect against cell damage and prevent human red blood cells from being destroyed through hemolysis ( 13 ).
Plant foods like radicchio contain compounds that may lower your risk of heart disease.
One study showed that eating chicory reduced inflammation and heart damage in rats, while also preventing the buildup of plaque in the arteries, a known risk factor for heart disease ( 14 ).
A study in 47 healthy adults found that those who consumed 1.25 cups (300 ml) of a chicory root extract beverage daily for 4 weeks experienced a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (the top number of a reading), compared with a placebo group ( 15 ).
Other research has indicated that radicchio contains  polyphenolic compounds  like luteolin that have antiplatelet activity, meaning they may improve circulation and prevent blood clots ( 16 ).
Radicchio contains compounds that could help fight  infections caused by parasites .
In one review of the antiparasitic properties of chicory, researchers suggested that radicchio may have future applications in treating gastrointestinal diseases in livestock in place of synthetic drugs that pose public health risks ( 17 ).
An animal study found chicory extract to have a significant antiparasitic effect on a type of roundworm infection common in pigs.
This was attributed to sesquiterpene lactones, which are potentially disease-fighting compounds unique to the  Asteraceae  plant family ( 18 ,  19 ).
Although research is promising, more human studies are needed to determine how much radicchio is needed in the diet to achieve these effects and which infections it could benefit.
The compounds in radicchio may offer other health benefits, but more research is needed to determine specific applications and doses:
May promote strong bones.  Radicchio contains a large amount of vitamin K, which regulates and promotes the calcium accumulation in your body and supports  bone strength  ( 20 ).
May support blood sugar control.  Adults who drank 1.25 cups (300 ml) of a chicory root extract beverage daily for 4 weeks had reduced levels of hemoglobin A1c, an indicator of long-term blood sugar levels ( 15 ).
May improve digestive health.  In the same study, participants reported an improvement in  bowel regularity  when consuming chicory root extract. This could be due to its inulin fiber content, which is important for gastrointestinal health ( 15 ).
Radicchio contains antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that may fight parasites, regulate blood sugar, and support heart and digestive health. Still, most research has used chicory root extract and not the whole plant.

How to choose, store, and add radicchio to your diet
Radicchio is found in the produce section of most grocery stores alongside other leafy vegetables like  cabbage , endive, and lettuce.
Choose radicchio with bold red color and prominent white ribs. Avoid plants with bruises, cracks, or soft spots.
Most raw, unwashed radicchio will keep for up to 2 weeks in the crisper drawer of your refrigerator.
To prepare radicchio, trim or remove the outer leaves and wash the head under cool water before using.
Radicchio can be chopped and eaten raw in salads, grilled in wedges, or cooked in warm dishes like soups, risotto, and pasta. It can also be diced and added onto pizza. Using radicchio with sweet or acidic ingredients can reduce or complement its  bitter flavor .
If you don’t have radicchio on hand, endive, chicory, escarole, and arugula offer similar flavors to your dishes.
Radicchio is stored like other leafy greens and will keep in the refrigerator for 2 weeks raw and unwashed. Wash just before preparing, and use in salads, risotto, soup, or pasta dishes.

The bottom line
Radicchio is a leafy vegetable similar to red cabbage but with a more bitter taste.
It’s a good source of  micronutrients  like zinc, copper, and vitamin K, and works well in Italian dishes like pasta, soup, pizza, and salads. You may enjoy radicchio raw, cooked, or grilled.
Radicchio is high in antioxidants called anthocyanins which may benefit your heart and digestive system. This vegetable may also fight infections and support healthy bones and blood sugar.
However, keep in mind that most research uses concentrated chicory root extract, making it difficult to determine how much radicchio you need to eat to achieve these potential benefits and which specific applications it may have.
