How to ensure your mayo is dairy-free
Regardless of whether you avoid dairy for personal, religious, or health-related reasons, checking the  ingredient label  of your mayo is key to ensuring that it’s dairy-free.
Note that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires manufacturers to identify  common food allergens  like milk directly on the label ( 2 ).
However, it’s also a good idea to scan the label to check for milk-based ingredients. Look for ingredients like butter, casein, milk, cheese, milk protein hydrolysates, or whey, all of which indicate that the product contains dairy.
If you’re following a dairy-free diet, be sure to check the label of your mayo to ensure that it’s free of dairy products.
