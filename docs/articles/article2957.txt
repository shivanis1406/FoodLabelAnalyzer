Title: Should You Buy a Peloton or NordicTrack Bike?

On May 11, 2023, Peloton announced a  voluntary recall  of the original Peloton model Bikes sold from January 2018 to May 2023 (model number PL-01) in the United States due to safety concerns. According to the company, the seat post can break unexpectedly, potentially resulting in a fall or injury. Peloton recommends that customers who already own a recalled model stop using it and contact Peloton for a free replacement seat post.
Peloton and NordicTrack are two popular brands of exercise bikes.
In addition to boasting a sleek design and convenient touchscreen display, both offer a variety of interactive cycling classes.
However, a few key differences set these two brands apart.
This article reviews some of the similarities and differences between Peloton and NordicTrack bikes to help you determine which may be a better choice for you.

Price
The original  Peloton  Bike costs $1,895, while the Peloton Bike+ starts at $2,495. Both products include free delivery and assembly.
Keep in mind that Peloton membership, which includes unlimited live and on-demand classes, is not included in this price.
The Peloton All-Access Membership, which allows you to create unlimited user profiles on a single account, costs $39 per month. Digital membership, which only allows one user per account, costs $12.99 per month.
Compared with Peloton, the NordicTrack bikes are slightly more affordable.
The S15i Studio Cycle bike costs $1,599, while the S22i Studio Cycle retails for $1,999.
Delivery costs an additional $199 and does not include assembly.
Both NordicTrack bikes come with a 1-year family membership to iFit, which is NordicTrack’s interactive fitness platform that provides access to streaming and on-demand workout classes.
After your trial membership expires, iFit offers annual individual memberships for $180 per year and family memberships for $396 per year, or $39 per month.

Warranty
Both Peloton models include a 12-month limited warranty on the touchscreen and original bike components, as well as a 5-year warranty on the bike frame.
Peloton likewise offers a 30-day return policy if you’re dissatisfied.
Conversely, all NordicTrack Commercial Studio Cycle models include a 10-year warranty on the bike frame and a 2-year parts warranty.
NordicTrack also offers a 30-day return policy and charges a 10% restocking fee for all returns.

Seat
Both Peloton models include a sport series saddle, which is designed to maximize performance and comfort.
However, you can easily swap out the saddle for any standard  cycling  seat if you prefer another type.

The Peloton Bike+ is equipped with a 23.8-inch (60.5-cm) touchscreen with a front-facing camera, built-in microphone, and front and rear speakers.

Both also feature two digitally amplified speakers and an auxiliary port to play music while you ride.

Training options
Peloton bikes require a monthly Peloton membership, which offers unlimited access to their extensive library of live and on-demand  workout classes .
In addition to cycling classes, the app includes cross-training options like yoga, strength training, and boot camp.
The app includes live performance tracking, which displays the metrics of your ride, along with an interactive leaderboard.
The Peloton All-Access Membership allows you to create unlimited user profiles on a single device, which makes it easy to track the workout history, achievements, and milestones of each member of your household.
On the other hand, the Peloton Digital Membership allows only a single user per account.
Meanwhile, NordicTrack works with iFit, which also offers a variety of interactive personal training options.
Membership includes unlimited access to live and on-demand workouts, performance tracking, and community support to help you stay motivated.
It also features global workouts, allowing you to complete training programs in destinations all over the world.
iFit offers membership plans for both individuals and families, which allow up to five users per account.

The bottom line
NordicTrack and Peloton are two popular brands of  exercise bikes .
Both brands share many similarities, especially in terms of size, built-in equipment, and available training options.
