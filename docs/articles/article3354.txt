Title: 7 Tips to Get into Ketosis

Cutting carbs, increasing your intake of healthy fats, and getting more exercise may help you enter ketosis.
Ketosis is a normal metabolic process that provides fuel for your body at times when fewer carbohydrates are available. Nutritional ketosis may offer health benefits.
During nutritional ketosis, your body converts fat into compounds called ketones and begins using them as its main source of energy. Ketones are also known as ketone bodies.
Diets that promote ketosis are highly beneficial for weight loss, partly due to their appetite-suppressing effects. Ketosis may also be helpful for type 2 diabetes and neurological disorders, among other conditions.
But getting into a state of ketosis can take some work and planning. It’s not as simple as just cutting carbs.
There is  still debate  about the long-term safety of the ketogenic diet. Before making major dietary changes, such as trying a ketogenic diet, it’s important to consult a qualified health professional. This is especially the case for children, those who have underlying health conditions, and those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
Potential risks of this style of eating include nutritional deficiencies, kidney stones, changes in electrolyte levels, and bone loss.
Here are 7 effective tips to get into ketosis.

1. Minimize your carb consumption
Eating  a very low carb diet  is by far the most important factor in entering  ketosis .
Your cells typically use  glucose  (sugar) as their main source of fuel. However, most of your cells can also use other fuel sources, including fatty acids and ketones.
Your body stores glucose in the form of glycogen in your liver and muscles.
When your carb intake is very low, your glycogen stores are reduced and your levels of the hormone insulin decline. This allows fatty acids to be released from fat stores in your body.
Your liver converts some of these fatty acids into the ketones acetone, acetoacetate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Portions of your brain  can use  these ketones as fuel.
The degree of carb restriction needed to induce ketosis varies by the person and can be affected by certain factors, such as the types of exercise you do.
Some people need to limit their  net carb  intake to 50 grams (g) or fewer per day, while others can get into ketosis while eating more than that.
For this reason, the  induction phase  of the Atkins diet requires restricting carb intake to 20 g or fewer per day for 2 weeks to guarantee that you get into ketosis.
After that, you can add small amounts of carbs back to your diet very gradually, as long as you maintain ketosis.
Each person will potentially have a different carb intake limit to reach and maintain ketosis, depending on the total number of calories they eat and their daily activity levels. Generally, eating 5–10% of total calories from carbs will produce ketosis.
These carb and ketone ranges are  advised  for people who want to get into ketosis to promote weight loss, manage their blood sugar levels, or reduce their heart disease risk factors.
Ketogenic diets used in epilepsy management and as experimental cancer therapy may also  restrict carbs . However, anyone using the diet for therapeutic purposes should do so only under the supervision of a medical professional.

2. Include coconut oil in your diet
Eating  coconut oil  can help you get into ketosis.
Importantly, not all commercial coconut oil products you can buy in stores have the same content and health benefits.
Generally, coconut oil contains fats called  medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) .
Unlike most fats, MCTs are rapidly absorbed and taken directly to your liver, where they can be used immediately for energy or converted into ketones.
Consuming coconut oil and these MCTs may be  one of the best ways  to increase ketone levels in people with Alzheimer’s disease and other nervous system disorders.
Although coconut oil contains four types of MCTs,  around 50% of its fat  comes from the kind known as lauric acid.
Some  research suggests  that fat sources with a higher percentage of lauric acid may produce a more sustained level of ketosis. This is because it’s metabolized more gradually than other MCTs.
MCTs have been used to induce ketosis in children who have epilepsy. In a high MCT diet, ketosis occurs without restricting carbs as drastically as in the classic ketogenic diet.
Other research  has found that a high MCT diet containing around 20% of calories from carbs produces effects similar to those of the classic ketogenic diet, which provides fewer than 5% of calories from carbs.
When adding coconut oil to your diet, it’s a good idea to do so slowly to minimize possible digestive side effects such as stomach cramping and diarrhea.

3. Ramp up your physical activity
Being more physically active each day  can help you  get into and stay in ketosis. It may also be  beneficial for some types of athletic performance .
When you exercise, you deplete your body’s glycogen stores. These are normally replenished when you eat carbs, which are broken down into glucose. The glucose that isn’t needed immediately is stored as glycogen.
However, if you minimize your carb intake, your glycogen stores remain low. In response, your liver increases its production of ketones, which can be used as an alternative fuel source for your muscles.
Working out in a fasted state  has been shown  to drive up ketone levels.
But. keep in mind that although exercise increases ketone production, it may take 1–4 weeks for your body to adapt to using ketones and fatty acids as primary fuel sources. During this time, your physical performance may be temporarily reduced.

4. Increase your healthy fat intake
Consuming plenty of  healthy fats  can boost your ketone levels and help you reach ketosis.
Indeed, a very low carb ketogenic diet not only minimizes carbs but also calls for a high fat intake.
Ketogenic diets for  weight loss , exercise performance, and metabolic health usually provide  55–60%  of calories from fat.
The classic ketogenic diet used for epilepsy is even higher in fat. Typically,  85–90%  of calories come from fat.
However, extremely high fat intake doesn’t necessarily translate into higher ketone levels.
A  3-week study  from 2015 that included 11 healthy people compared the effects of fasting on breath ketone levels. Overall, ketone levels were found to be similar in people consuming 79% of calories from fat and people consuming 90% of calories from fat.
Because fat makes up such a large percentage of a  ketogenic diet , it’s important to choose high quality fat sources.
Healthy fats include fatty fish, olive oil, and avocado oil. Many  healthy, high fat foods  are also very low in carbs.
However, consuming high fat foods can lead to side effects such as:
constipation
diarrhea
fatigue
abdominal pain
vomiting
gastroesophageal reflux disease (in some children)
If weight loss is your goal, it’s important to make sure you’re not consuming too many calories in total, as this can cause your weight loss to stall.

5. Try a short fast or a fat fast
Another way to get into ketosis is to go without eating for several hours.
In fact, many people go into mild ketosis between dinner and breakfast.
Children with epilepsy traditionally fasted for  12–48 hours  before they started a ketogenic diet. This approach often required supervision in a hospital.
Nonfasting protocols are more commonplace now. However, fasting can help ensure that some children get into ketosis quickly so that seizures can be reduced sooner.
Intermittent fasting , a dietary approach that involves regular short-term fasts, may also induce ketosis.

6. Maintain adequate protein intake
Getting into ketosis requires a  protein intake  that’s adequate but not excessive.
The classic ketogenic diet used in people with epilepsy restricts both carbs and protein to maximize ketone levels.
The same diet may be  beneficial for people with cancer , as it may limit tumor growth.
However, for most people, drastically cutting protein intake to increase ketone production isn’t a healthy practice.
First, it’s important to consume enough protein to supply your liver with amino acids that can be used for gluconeogenesis, or making glucose.
In this process, your liver provides glucose for the few cells and organs in your body that can’t use ketones as fuel, such as your red blood cells and portions of your kidneys and brain.
Second, protein intake should be high enough to maintain muscle mass when carb intake is low, especially during weight loss.
Although losing weight typically results in the loss of both muscle and fat, consuming enough protein on a very low carb diet  can help preserve  muscle mass.
Several studies have shown that the preservation of muscle mass and physical performance is maximized when protein intake is in the range of 0.55–0.77 grams per pound (g/lb), or 1.2–1.7 grams per kilogram (g/kg), of lean mass.
A daily protein intake of 0.45–0.68 g/lb (1–1.5 g/kg) will help you maintain lean mass while losing weight.
To calculate your protein needs on a ketogenic diet, multiply your ideal body weight in pounds by 0.55–0.77 (1.2–1.7 in kilograms). For example, if your ideal body weight is 130 lb (59 kg), your protein intake should be 71–100 g.

7. Test ketone levels and adjust your diet as needed
As with many things in nutrition, reaching and maintaining a state of ketosis is highly individualized.
Therefore, it can be helpful to test your ketone levels to ensure you’re achieving your goals.
The three types of ketones — acetone, acetoacetate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate — can be measured in your breath, urine, and blood, respectively. Using one or more of these methods to test ketone levels can help you determine whether you need to make any adjustments to get into ketosis.
Acetone is found in your breath, and studies have confirmed that testing acetone breath levels is a reliable way to monitor ketosis in people following ketogenic diets.
The Ketonix meter  measures acetone in your breath. After breathing into the meter, a color flashes to indicate whether you’re in ketosis and how high your levels are.
The ketone measured in urine is acetoacetate.  Ketone urine strips  are dipped into urine and turn various shades of pink or purple depending on the level of ketones present. A darker color reflects higher ketone levels.
Ketone urine strips are easy to use and fairly inexpensive. Although their accuracy in long-term use has been questioned, they should initially confirm that you’re in ketosis.
A small  2016 study  found that, in people on a ketogenic diet, urinary ketones tend to be highest in the early morning and after dinner.
Lastly, ketones can be measured with a blood ketone meter. It works similarly to a glucose meter — you place a small drop of blood on a strip and insert it into the meter.
It measures the amount of beta-hydroxybutyrate in your blood, and this has been found to be a valid indicator of ketosis levels.
The disadvantage of measuring blood ketones is that the strips are very expensive.

The bottom line
When you get into ketosis, your body begins to use ketones for fuel.
For people who have adopted a ketogenic diet as a means to lose weight, getting into ketosis is an important step toward that goal. Other benefits of ketosis include seizure reduction in people with epilepsy.
Cutting your carb intake is the best way to get into ketosis. Other actions, such as consuming MCT oil and exercising in a fasted state, may also help.
Quick and easy methods, such as using special urine strips, can let you know whether you’re maintaining ketosis or you need to make some adjustments to your diet.
