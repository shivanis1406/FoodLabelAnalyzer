Title: How to Count Macros: A Step-By-Step Guide

Counting macros may support weight loss, improve diet quality, and help you reach certain health-related goals. It involves determining your nutrient needs and using a food journal or app to track your intake.
If you belong to a gym or tune in to the health community, chances are you’ve heard the term “counting macros.”
Popularly used by people looking to shed weight or gain muscle mass, counting  macronutrients  (macros) can help you reach various health goals.
It entails keeping track of the calories and types of foods you eat in order to achieve certain macronutrient and calorie goals.
Though counting macros is relatively simple, it can be confusing if you’re just starting out.
This article explains the benefits of counting macros and provides a step-by-step guide on how to get started.

What are macronutrients?
In order to successfully count macronutrients, it’s important to know what they are and why some people need different macronutrient ratios than others.
Carbohydrates include sugars, starches, and  fibers  ( 1 ).
Most types of carbs get broken down into glucose, or sugar, which your body either uses for immediate energy or stores as glycogen — the storage form of glucose — in your liver and muscles.
Carbs provide 4 calories per gram (g) and typically make up the largest portion of people’s calorie intake.
Carb intake is among the most hotly debated of all macronutrient recommendations, but major health organizations suggest consuming 45%–65% of your daily calories from carbs ( 1 ).
Carbohydrates  are found in foods like grains, vegetables, beans, dairy products, and fruits.
Fats have the most calories of all macronutrients, providing 9 calories per g.
Your body needs fat for energy and critical functions, such as hormone production, nutrient absorption, and body temperature maintenance ( 2 ).
Though typical macronutrient recommendations for fats range from 20%–35% of total calories, many people find success following a diet higher in fat ( 3 ).
Fats  are found in foods like oils, butter, avocado, nuts, seeds, meat, and fatty fish.
Like carbs, proteins provide 4 calories per g.
Proteins  are vital for processes like cell signaling, immune function, and the building of tissues, hormones, and enzymes ( 4 ).
It’s recommended that proteins comprise 10%–35% of your total calorie intake ( 5 ).
However,  protein recommendations  vary depending on body composition goals, age, health, and more.
Examples of protein-rich foods include meat, eggs, poultry, fish, tofu, and lentils.
The three macronutrients to keep track of are carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Macronutrient recommendations vary depending on many factors.

How to count them
Learning how to count macronutrients does take some effort, but it’s a method that anyone can use.
The following steps will get you started.
In order to calculate your overall  calorie needs , you need to determine resting energy expenditure (REE) and non-resting energy expenditure (NREE).
REE refers to the number of calories a person burns at rest, while NREE indicates calories burned during activity and digestion ( 6 ).
Adding REE and NREE gives you the total number of calories burned in a day, also known as total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) ( 6 ).
In order to determine your overall calorie needs, you can either use a simple online calculator or the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation:
Males:  calories/day = 10 x weight (kilograms, or kg) + 6.25 x height (centimeters, or cm) – 5 x age (years) + 5
Females:  calories/day = 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x age (years) – 161
Then, multiply your result by an activity factor — a number that represents different levels of activity ( 7 ):
Sedentary:  x 1.2 (limited exercise)
Lightly active:  x 1.375 (light exercise less than 3 days per week)
Moderately active:  x 1.55 (moderate exercise most days of the week)
Very active:  x 1.725 (hard exercise every day)
Extra active:  x 1.9 (strenuous exercise two or more times per day)
The end result gives you your TDEE.
Calories  can either be added or subtracted from your total expenditure in order to reach different goals.
In other words, those trying to lose weight should consume fewer calories than they expend, while those looking to gain muscle mass should increase calories.
After determining how many calories to consume each day, the next step is to decide what macronutrient ratio works best for you.
Typical macronutrient recommendations are as follows ( 8 ):
Carbs:  45%–65% of total calories
Fats:  20%–35% of total calories
Proteins:  10%–35% of total calories
Keep in mind that these recommendations may not fit your specific needs.
Your ratio can be fine-tuned in order to achieve specific objectives.
For example, a person who wants to obtain better blood sugar control and lose excess body fat may excel on a meal plan consisting of 35% carbs, 30% fat, and 35% protein.
Someone pursuing a  ketogenic diet  would need much more fat and fewer carbs, while an endurance athlete may need higher carb intake ( 9 ,  10 ).
As you can see,  macronutrient ratios  can vary depending on dietary preferences, weight loss goals, and other factors.
Next, it’s time to start tracking your macros.
The term “tracking macros” simply means logging the foods you eat on a website, app, or food journal.
The most convenient way to track macros may be through a  nutrition app  like MyFitnessPal, Lose It!, or My Macros +.
These apps are user-friendly and specifically designed to simplify tracking macros.
In addition, a digital food scale may help you track your macros — though it isn’t necessary. If you invest in one, weigh each food item you eat before logging it into your app of choice.
Several apps feature a barcode scanner that automatically inputs a serving of a scanned food into your macro log.
You can also hand-write macros into a  physical journal . The method depends on your individual preference.
Keep in mind that it’s not necessary to hit your macro targets exactly. You can still meet your goals even if you go a few grams over or under each day.
Here’s an example of how to calculate macronutrients for a 2,000-calorie diet consisting of 40% carbs, 30% protein, and 30% fat.
Carbs:
4 calories per g
40% of 2,000 calories = 800 calories of carbs per day
Total g of carbs allowed per day = 800/4 = 200 g
Proteins:
4 calories per g
30% of 2,000 calories = 600 calories of protein per day
Total grams of protein allowed per day = 600/4 = 150 g
Fats:
9 calories per g
30% of 2,000 calories = 600 calories of protein per day
Total grams of fat allowed per day = 600/9 = 67 g
In this scenario, your ideal daily intake would be 200 g of carbs, 150 g of protein, and 67 g of fat.
To count macros, determine your calorie and macronutrient needs, then log macros into an app or food journal.

Benefits
Macronutrient counting may provide several benefits.
Counting macros can focus your attention on food quality rather than calorie content.
For example, a bowl of sugary cereal may have a similar number of calories as a bowl of oats topped with berries and pumpkin seeds, but these meals vary widely in macronutrient content.
Counting macros may lead you to choose more  nutrient-dense foods  in order to fulfill set macronutrient ranges.
However, less nutritious foods may still fit into your macros and calories — so it’s important to make nutrient-dense foods a priority.
Counting macros may be particularly  effective for weight loss  because it sets out specific dietary recommendations.
For instance, tracking macros can help those following high protein, low carb diets, which are linked to weight loss ( 11 ).
Plus, research shows that tracking food intake may aid long-term weight maintenance ( 12 ).
Macronutrient counting is popular among athletes and those with specific health goals other than weight loss.
Anyone looking to  build muscle mass  may have greater protein needs than people simply looking to drop excess body fat.
Counting macros is essential for people who need to consume specific amounts of macronutrients in order to boost performance and gain lean body mass.
For example, research shows that resistance-trained athletes may need as much as 1.4 g of protein per pound (lb) (3.1 g per kg) of body weight per day to maintain muscle mass ( 13 ).
Counting macros may ensure that your macronutrient needs are being met.
Macronutrient counting is an excellent tool for those looking to lose weight or build muscle. It can promote healthier eating and improved diet quality.

How to meet your needs
Depending on macronutrient ranges, those counting macros may need to add or reduce foods rich in carbohydrates, fats, or proteins.
For example, someone transitioning to a macronutrient range of 40% carbs, 35% fat, and 25% protein may need to replace some of their carbs with sources of healthy fats and protein.
The following are examples of healthy foods for each macronutrient.
Some foods are high in more than one macronutrient and can fulfill different macro needs.
grains, including oats, brown rice, and quinoa
whole-wheat pasta
whole-grain bread
starchy vegetables , such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, and winter squash
fruits like berries, bananas, pineapple, and apples
beans, lentils, and peas
milk and yogurt
egg whites
meats
poultry
fish
shellfish
tofu
beans
lentils
seitan
tempeh
milk and yogurt
protein powders
egg yolks
olive and avocado oils
butter
nuts and  nut butters
coconut oil and coconut flakes
avocado
full-fat milk and yogurt
full-fat cheese
flaxseeds and  chia seeds
fatty fish like salmon and sardines
When trying to reach specific macronutrient goals, focus on foods rich in the macronutrients you need to consume the most.

Not for everyone
People who thrive on structure may find that counting macros is ideal for their health goals.
Counting macros can increase your awareness of the quality and amount of food you are consuming.
Plus, it may be a good tool for those following ketogenic or  high protein diets .
That said, counting macros isn’t for everyone.
Because macro counting puts so much emphasis on tracking calories and logging intake, anyone with a history of eating disorders should steer clear of counting macros ( 14 ).
Focusing on food intake this intently could even lead to disordered eating patterns in those without a history of these behaviors ( 15 ).
Keep in mind that it’s also possible to eat poorly while engaging in macro counting because it permits all foods as long as the item fits into set macronutrient ranges.
Those using macro counting should aim — depending on their goals — to follow a nutritious, well-rounded diet rich in fresh produce, healthy fats,  complex carbs , and protein sources.
Counting macros may help people lose weight and reach health goals. However, it’s not appropriate for those with a history of eating disorders.

The bottom line
When first counting macros, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed.
However, following the steps above can streamline the process and set you up for success.
The most important steps in  counting macros  are setting a calorie goal and macronutrient range for carbs, protein, and fat that works best for you.
Then, log your food intake and aim to stay within your macros by eating a diet rich in fresh produce, healthy fats, complex carbs, and protein sources.
Before you know it, counting macros will feel natural.
