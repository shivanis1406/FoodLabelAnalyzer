Title: How Probiotics Can Help You Lose Weight and Belly Fat

Some probiotic strains may help support weight loss and provide other health benefits, including to your heart, immune system, and digestive system.
Probiotics  are live microorganisms that have health benefits when eaten. They’re found in both supplements and fermented foods.
Researchers  have found that probiotics may improve your immune function and digestive and heart health, among other benefits.
Studies  also suggest that  probiotics can help you lose weight  and belly fat.

Gut bacteria may affect body weight regulation
Hundreds of  microorganisms  reside in your digestive system.
According to  research , the majority of these are friendly bacteria that produce several important nutrients, including vitamin K and certain B vitamins.
Studies  have found that they also help break down  fiber , which your body can’t digest, turning it into beneficial short-chain fatty acids like butyrate.
There are two main families of good bacteria in the gut: bacteroidetes and firmicutes.  Research  has found that body weight seems to be related to the balance of these two families of bacteria.
One  2021 review  of several studies found that moderate-weight people have different gut bacteria than those with overweight or obesity, but more research is needed.
In the some of those studies, people with obesity had more firmicutes and fewer bacteroidetes, compared with moderate-weight people. The review found that people with obesity tend to have less diverse gut bacteria than lean people.
Studies suggest that gut bacteria may play a powerful role in body weight regulation.

How probiotics affect body weight
According to  research , probiotics seem to influence appetite and energy usage via the production of acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which are short-chain fatty acids.
Studies  have found that certain probiotics may inhibit the absorption of dietary fat, decreasing inflammation and increasing the amount of fat excreted with feces.
In other words, they make your body “harvest” fewer calories from the foods you eat. Certain bacteria, such as those from the  Lactobacillus  family, have been found to function in this way.
Probiotics may also fight obesity in other ways, including:
Releasing appetite-regulating hormones:  According to  research , probiotics may help release the appetite-reducing hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). Increased levels of these hormones may help you burn calories and fat.
Increasing levels of fat-regulating proteins:   Research  has also found that probiotics may increase levels of the protein angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4). This may lead to decreased fat storage.
By  improving the health of your gut lining ,  studies  have found that probiotics may reduce systemic inflammation and protect against obesity and other diseases.
Probiotics may reduce the number of calories you absorb from food. They also affect levels of hormones and proteins related to appetite and fat storage, as well as potentially reduce inflammation, which can drive obesity.

Probiotics may help you lose weight and belly fat
A  recent review  of studies on probiotics and weight loss in people with overweight and obesity suggests that probiotics may help you lose weight and lower your body fat percentage. However, more research is needed.
In particular,  studies  have found that certain strains of the  Lactobacillus  family can help you lose weight and  belly fat  combined with exercise.
In one  study , consuming products with  Lactobacillus curvatus  and  Lactobacillus plantarum  displayed a reduction in body weight, visceral fat mass, and waist circumference.
In another  study , 114 adults with obesity were given either the probiotic  Lactobacillus sakei  or a placebo for 12 weeks. Those taking the probiotic experienced significant decreases in both body fat mass and waist circumference.
Researchers  have found that  Lactobacillus gasseri  shows promising effects on weight loss in humans.
The meta study found that  Lactobacillus gasseri  decreased body weight, BMI, waist circumference, body fat mass or fat percentage in those with overweight or obesity. It also decreased visceral fat.
What’s more, it still showed weight loss effects even when the participants did not undergo energy restriction. However, more research is needed.
Other strains of probiotics may also help reduce weight and belly fat.
In an 6-month  study , 220 adults with overweight or obesity took either a probiotic that included strains of both  Lactobacillus  and  Bifidobacterium  or a placebo. The participants were not asked to change their diet.
Those consuming the probiotic lost more weight than those taking a placebo.
One  2020 study  found that  Bifidobacterium animalis  subsp.  lactis  had a positive effect on weight management and reduced inflammation.
Several strains of probiotics in both the  Lactobacillus  and  Bifidobacterium  family have been shown to reduce weight.

Some probiotics may prevent weight gain
Losing weight is not the only way to fight obesity. Preventing unwanted weight gain in the first place may be even more valuable in avoiding obesity.
In one  study , taking a probiotic formulation called VSL#3 prevented weight gain and insulin resistance in mice.
This indicates that some probiotic strains might have the same effect in humans. However, this needs to be studied further.
Certain probiotic strains, such as VSL#3, may be able to reduce weight gain. However, more research is needed.

Takeaway
Probiotics offer a wide range of  health benefits .
Evidence indicates that  Lactobacillus gasseri  may help people with obesity lose weight and waist circumference. Additionally, a probiotic supplement blend called VSL#3 may also reduce weight gain, but more research is needed.
At the end of the day, certain types of probiotics may have modest effects on your weight, especially when combined with a healthy, whole-foods diet.
However, there are many other reasons to  take a probiotic supplement . They can improve your digestive health and cardiovascular risk factors, as well as reduce inflammation.
