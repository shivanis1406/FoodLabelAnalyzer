Title: What’s the Difference Between Peaches and Apricots?

Apricots and peaches differ in sweetness and flavor—peaches are sweeter, and apricots are more acidic. Both fruits are healthy and can be used in desserts, dishes, or jams.
Peaches and apricots are two popular stone fruits.
Though they’re similar in color and shape, they have their own unique characteristics.
This article compares the similarities and differences between peaches and apricots.

Apricots are a lot smaller
Although both fruits are fuzzy and yellow-orange in color, apricots are noticeably smaller than peaches.
One apricot (35 grams) is approximately 1/4 the size of a small peach (130 grams) ( 1 ,  2 ).
This fruit also boasts  fewer calories , with only 17 calories per fruit compared with 50 in a small peach ( 1 ,  2 ).
Due to apricots’ smaller size, most people enjoy eating a few in one sitting.
Both are  stone fruits , meaning that they contain a pit. Apricot pits are smoother and smaller than those in peaches ( 3 ).
Apricots are 1/4 the size of a small peach and much lower in calories. People may eat multiple apricots in a single sitting — whereas they might stick to just one peach.

Different species
Peaches and apricots belong to the same family,  Rosaceae , also known as the rose family. Apples, pears, and  almonds  are likewise in this group.
Although closely related, peaches and apricots aren’t from the same regions.
The scientific name for the peach,  Prunus persica,  denotes its abundance in Persia — modern-day Iran — despite having originated in Asia ( 4 ,  3 ).
Meanwhile, apricots ( Prunus armeniaca ) are also called Armenian plums because they’re known to have grown historically in this region ( 5 ,  6 ).
As these fruits come from the same family, they contain similar nutrients, including  potassium , vitamin C, and beta carotene.
However, peaches provide higher amounts of these nutrients in a single serving because of their larger size ( 1 ,  2 ).
Peaches and apricots belong to the rose family but are different species. They both offer high levels of potassium, vitamin C, and beta carotene.

Peaches taste sweeter
The most noticeable difference between apricots and peaches is their flavor.
Peaches have a  higher sugar content  than apricots, which gives them a sweeter taste. One small peach (130 grams) packs 11 grams of sugar, while 1 apricot (35 grams) contains only 3 grams ( 1 ,  2 ).
In contrast, apricots are more tart due to their levels of malic acid, a compound that promotes tartness ( 7 ,  8 ,  9 ).
Furthermore, peaches have a  higher water content , which lends them their characteristic juiciness with each bite ( 7 ).
Peaches have higher sugar and water contents than apricots, making them taste sweeter.

Culinary uses
Peaches and apricots are widely used in main dishes, desserts, and jams. They can be enjoyed fresh, canned, or  dried .
Both fruits are usually available during summer and low in cost.
Despite their differences in taste, they can often be swapped for one another in recipes.
Keep in mind that if you’re replacing peaches with apricots, you may have to add slightly more liquid and sugar to your dish. You may also have to add more apricots to your recipe to accommodate for their smaller size.
Be sure to gently wash the skin of each fruit to remove any excess dirt,  pesticides , and bacteria. To do this, run the fruit under cold water and gently rub the skin using your hands. Avoid using a vegetable brush, as this will damage the skin.
Finally, remove the pit before eating.
Peaches and apricots are in season during the summer months. They can usually be swapped for one another in recipes.

The bottom line
Apricots  and peaches are stone fruits that bear similar coloring and shapes but differ in size and flavor.
Peaches  are sweeter and juicier, whereas apricots have a slightly tart flavor.
Whichever you choose, both are excellent sources of many nutrients and can be incorporated into many dishes, desserts, and jams.
All things considered, both summer fruits are worth adding to your diet for a healthy burst of sweetness.
