Title: Are mindbodygreen Supplements Worth It? Our Testers and Dietitians Explain

Mindbodygreen offers high quality supplements that our testers enjoyed. The biggest downside is the cost, which may not be suitable for many budgets.

The tl;dr on mindbodygreen
Mindbodygreen is a well-known wellness and supplement company  established in 2009, selling high end supplement blends, some personal care items, and coffee.
Some of the ways the company stands out against competitors include:
Rooted in science:  According to mindbodygreen, the company creates solutions-based supplements using science-backed nutrients.
Quality sourced:  The company claims to source ingredients only from reputable suppliers, and every ingredient used is tested for botanical identification, purity testing, and potency testing before being used to manufacture any of its supplements.
Comprehensively tested:  Individual ingredients are tested before being used to manufacture the products, and mindbodygreen states that all of its products are tested for precision, potency, and purity in  International Organization for Standardization (ISO)  certified labs.
Sustainably minded:  All products are packaged in recyclable amber glass jars and shipped in 100% recyclable boxes made from 100% recycled materials. The company also sources certified organic ingredients whenever possible, although not all products are organic.
With this, mindbodygreen supplements come at a higher price tag  than many supplements on the market.
We dug into the company’s quality standards, testing processes, and supplement formulations to help you decide whether or not mindbodygreen’s supplements are right for you.
Our editors also tested some of mindbodygreen’s most popular products, including Omega-3 Potency+, Ultimate Multivitamin+, Probiotic+, the whey protein powder, the vitamin D3 supplement, and the creatine supplement.

It uses multiple ISO certified labs for  third-party testing  on its products, testing them at four stages: raw material, in process, and finished product potency and purity testing.
Purity testing includes checking for the presence of heavy metals and microbes.
Mindbodygreen says that while it doesn’t make product COAs publicly available, it does retain these confidential documents on file for auditing purposes. Additionally, the company doesn’t disclose the names of the third-party labs.

Mindbodygreen’s omega-3 potency+ is a fish oil supplement that provides 1,500 milligrams (mg) of  omega-3s  from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
While there are no specific dietary guidelines for EPA and DHA, most organizations recommend a minimum of  250 to 500 mg of combined EPA and DHA  per day, with no more than 5,000 mg per day.

This supplement is origin certified by  ORIVO , stating that the product comes from anchovy from the South Pacific. It’s also free from gluten, soy, dairy, and GMOs.

“When I first got the omega-3 supplement from mindbodygreen, I was impressed by the look of the bottle, as it’s a thicker amber glass that looks nice versus the typical plastic vitamin bottles.
“As I’m not the best at taking pills, I was a bit scared of the size of these pills. However, given it’s a gelcap, it was relatively easy to swallow the two pills each day.
“Knowing these contain anchovy oil, I was happily surprised by he lack of any [fishy] taste. Also, I know ‘fish burps’ are common with  fish oil supplements , but I did not experience any burping.
“Given that I’ve only taken this supplement for a few weeks, I haven’t noticed any noticeable changes. The price point is high enough that it does give me pause to continue with this brand, although I have enjoyed the tasteless aspect and the overall look.”

This multivitamin is designed for healthy adults. It includes 14 vitamins and 13 minerals, including iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and vitamin K, which some multivitamins on the market leave out.

Mindbodygreen’s Multivitamin+ also includes over 200% of the Daily Value (DV) of all  eight B vitamins , which eliminates the need to take a separate B-complex vitamin.
It also includes several antioxidants and botanicals to support various aspects of health, including brain, heart, and eye health.

This product is vegan-friendly and free from dairy, gluten, soy, and GMOs.

“My first impression was that the container was the nicest-looking pill bottle I’ve ever seen. Remembering to take my daily multivitamin is often a challenge for me, but because of the pleasant packaging, I felt OK leaving them out on the counter, which helped me remember to take them.
“A single serving size is two pills. I’m not usually a fan of multivitamins that require multiple pills, but in this case, I was OK with it. Each pill was easy to swallow and they didn’t have a noticeable taste or aftertaste.
“The pills were gentle on the stomach. I don’t always eat breakfast, and even when I took them without food I did not experience any nausea, which is not the case with other multivitamins I have taken. In fact, I had no noticeable side effects.
“My only complaint is the cost. They are about twice as expensive as the multivitamins I usually take, but I was happy enough with the experience and lack of side effects that I’d consider switching to these, despite the increased expense.”

Mindbodygreen Probiotic+ includes four clinically tested  probiotic strains , to support healthy bowel movements and digestion, reduce gas and bloating, and support a healthy weight.
The vegan-friendly supplement is free from dairy, gluten, soy, and GMOs. It’s also shelf-stable, so you don’t have to worry about keeping it in the fridge.

“I was wowed with how gently regular this product made me! I also saw and felt a reduction in bloating, and I lost an inch in the midsection, which may have been due to fat loss or reduced bloating.
“The first thing I noticed, though, was my mood being boosted. My anxiety deflated some, and my overall sense of well-being improved. It was so refreshing.”

Mindbodygreen’s grass-fed whey protein isolate+ provides 25 g of high bioavailability protein, with 6 grams (g) of  branched-chain amino acids  and 2.5 g of leucine per scoop.
Leucine  plays  a key role in stimulating muscle growth, and mo st vegan protein powders in the market don’t have high enough amounts.
Though not vegan, this product is made with grass-fed whey and is low in lactose, so it’s a great option for folks with lactose intolerance. Our tester found that it didn’t cause the gastrointestinal (GI) effects she’s used to with other whey  protein powders .
Made with six ingredients, it contains no fillers, artificial flavors and sweeteners, flavoring chemicals, stevia, sugar alcohols, dyes, and other dicey ingredients.
“It’s one of the few whey protein powders I’ve tried that hasn’t caused GI side effects. I also like that it’s third-party tested, has a relatively short ingredient list, and contains just 3 grams of added sugar per 2-scoop serving. I also like that the serving size is 2 scoops. Because I generally get adequate protein in my diet, I like being able to make just a 1-scoop serving.
“The powders are packaged in bags rather than tubs. While tubs are bulkier, I like them better because they don’t get quite as messy. Plus, I find it easier to find the scoop burried inside. That said, these powders are easy to store.
“The vanilla powder was my favorite, and is actually one of my favorite vanilla-flavored powders that I’ve tried. The first time I tried it, I mixed 1 scoop of mindbodygreen’s vanilla whey protein with 6 ounces of water and 2 ounces of oat milk, fully expecting to only make it a few sips before putting it back in the fridge to be used in a smoothie later. However, before I knew it, I had finished the whole shake.
“I appreciated that the consistency was both smooth and refreshing, I also really liked the addition of cinnamon. I found that it gave the powder an enjoyable, French vanilla-like taste.
“The chocolate powder was more difficult to mix and I had to keep shaking it between sips to keep it fully mixed through. It wasn’t bad, but it just didn’t have the typical rich, chocolate taste that I was hoping for.”

Mindbodygreen’s vitamin D3 potency+ is a vegan-friendly and highly potent supplement. Sourced from algae, one capsule provides 625% of the Daily Value (% DV) of vitamin D3.
Keep in mind that having  too much vitamin D  can cause uncomfortable and dangerous side effects. This supplement provides more vitamin D than is necessary for most people. Because of this, you should only consider taking if you have been instructed to take 5,000 IUs of Vitamin D by a healthcare professional or dietitian.
This product also contains organic flaxseed, olive, and extra virgin olive oils, which helps your body absorb this fat-soluble vitamin. Plus, these oils have additional benefits for  heart health .
This product is free from GMOs, gluten, soy, and dairy.
“I was a bit nervous about the size of the vitamin D capsules. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find them easy to swallow. I also like that it’s a one-a-day formulation.
“There was no noticeable taste or aftertaste. I was also impressed by mindbodygreen’s packaging. The glass bottle is attractive enough to keep on my counter, so I never forgot to take my vitamins.
“Because I already take vitamin D on a regular basis, I didn’t expect to experience any noticeable benefits. But I like that the product itself contains vitamin D3 for optimal absorption. The downside is the price, which comes out to around $1 per serving. Not the most expensive but also not the cheapest.”

Mindbodygreen’s Creatine+ supplement is formulated to support muscle and brain health, with 5 g of creatine monohydrate in each serving.
It stands out from other  creatine supplements  on the market thanks to the addition of taurine, an amino acid  involved  in energy production.
Studies  show that creatine may enhance lean muscle, promote strength, and boost exercise capacity. Meanwhile, taurine  can support  healthy aging and may even offer benefits for heart health.
In addition to being third-party tested, this product is also vegan-friendly and free of gluten, dairy, soy, and GMOs.
Plus, according to our tester, it’s easy to mix and effective for providing an extra burst of energy and strength during intense workouts at the gym.

“My use of mindbodygreen’s creatine did align with my renewed commitment to going to the gym, so some of my results may have just been from that — but I also felt like my strength was improving more quickly after I started using the creatine.

“I did also feel like I had a little more energy ‘in the tank’ during intense workouts, letting me push just a bit harder. Now, 1 month in, I do feel like my muscles have a bit more definition, and I do find more strength powering my movements.

“Taking the creatine was easy enough, but also had some annoyances. The creatine is extremely powdery, so it was easy to get a ‘puff’ of reside floating around while grabbing my serving. It was also tough to grab the scoop from the bag, as it often settled down in the light powder.

“But the powder did mix pretty easily — I often didn’t even need a spoon. The texture, in general, was a bit grainy, though the more water I put it in, the less I noticed. During the loading phase, I’d stick it in other beverages, and didn’t notice the taste at all. [However], when just by itself in water, the taste was a bit chalky.”

So, are mindbodygreen supplements worth it?
Mindbodygreen supplements may be worth it if you have room in the budget to spare and you haven’t experienced results from other supplements. The company’s commitment to high quality ingredients, clinically backed formulations, and rigorous testing processes may help justify the high cost.
Our testers appreciated how easy the supplements were to swallow, and they didn’t experience any negative side effects where they typically do.
For example, one tester usually experiences gastrointestinal (GI) upset and bloating from whey protein but did not experience this with mindbodygreen’s protein powder. Another found she could take the multivitamin without food and did not get a stomachache as she has with other multivitamins.
Many products combine several nutrients and botanicals in one, which could offer savings and reduce overall supplements if you currently take many supplements separately.
With that said, it’s important to note that while many of the formulations used in mindbodygreen supplements are strongly supported by research, some products’ health claims have less evidence to support their use.
For example, the mindbodygreen Metabolism+ contains  ingredients  that have  limited research  to support their effectiveness. Taking this supplement is unlikely to have meaningful benefits on your weight without also addressing your diet, exercise regimen, stress levels, and other lifestyle factors.

How mindbodygreen supplements compare
Because there are many affordable,  high quality vitamin brands  on the market, it’s worth shopping around to find a product that works best for your budget and health needs.
Regardless of which brand you choose, make sure to talk with a healthcare professional before adding any new supplements to your wellness routine.
Here’s how mindbodygreen compares with other popular supplement brands:
