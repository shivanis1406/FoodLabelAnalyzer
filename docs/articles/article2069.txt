What is biotin?
Biotin is a B vitamin that your body needs to help convert food breakdown products into useable energy ( 1 ).
It’s richest in animal foods, including organ meats, fish, eggs, and meat. However, it’s also found in nuts, seeds, and sweet potatoes ( 1 ).
Most people get enough biotin in their diet, so deficiency is rare. However, you may be at increased risk of biotin deficiency if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, have alcohol use disorder, or have a condition called biotinidase deficiency ( 1 ).

Benefits of biotin
Some of the potential benefits of biotin include:
Metabolism.  The major role of biotin is to help metabolize the fatty acids, proteins, and sugars from food into a form that your body can use for energy ( 1 ).
Hair, skin, and nail support.  Some of the major symptoms of biotin deficiency include brittle nails and hair, alongside skin concerns, which has led many people to believe that biotin can help improve these areas in anyone. Supplement manufacturers have capitalized on this by including high doses of biotin in “hair, skin, and nails” formulations. However, there’s little evidence that biotin can help improve hair, skin, or nail health in people who don’t have a biotin deficiency ( 2 ).

How we chose
When choosing the best biotin supplements, we looked at the following:
Indicators of trust.  We prioritized products that are third-party tested for purity and potency and made in facilities that adhere to the current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs) set by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Ingredient quality.  We chose products that contain high quality ingredients, with minimal use of fillers and additives.
Vetting.  All the biotin supplements below have been vetted to ensure that they meet Healthline’s medical and business standards.
General price ranges with dollar signs ($–$$$) are indicated below. One dollar sign means the product is rather affordable, whereas three dollar signs indicate a higher price range.
Generally, prices range from $0.07–$1.67 per serving, or $9.30–$50 per container, though this may vary depending on where you shop.
Note that serving sizes vary by product.

Several reviewers mention that taking the vitamin has helped strengthen their nails, though others note that it took close to 1 year before they noticed improvements.
Still, despite anecdotal reports, keep in mind that there’s minimal evidence to support the effectiveness of biotin for hair and nail health.

In addition to biotin, Garden of Life Mykind Organic Plant Collagen Builder contains several other vitamins, minerals, and botanicals that may help support healthy hair and skin, such as  silica  and vitamin C ( 4 ).

The product is highly rated by reviewers, and it’s third-party tested by NSF International to ensure purity and potency.

Pure Encapsulations is a trusted supplement brand among healthcare professionals. The ingredients and products undergo rigorous testing by a number of third-party labs, such as Silliker, Eurofins, Covance, and Advance Laboratories.
This supplement contains 20,000% of the DV for biotin per two-tablet serving, along with a number of other active ingredients to support hair, skin, and nail health, such as silica, collagen, zinc, and  coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)  ( 4 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ).
Note that high doses of biotin don’t appear to pose a risk of  toxicity , although they may interfere with lab testing.
When taken at high doses, excess B vitamins are typically flushed out via your urine. However, it’s possible that there simply hasn’t been enough research on the potential side effects of taking too much ( 1 ).
Regardless, be sure to clear a high dose biotin supplement like this one with a healthcare professional, especially if you plan to take it over a long period.

Although the product is not third-party tested, it is produced in a cGMP manufacturing facility that meets FDA standards.

The MindBodyGreen Beauty & Gut Collagen+ is a collagen supplement that is specifically designed to promote skin and gut health.
In addition to a fairly low dose of biotin (when compared with other supplements) providing 1,667% of the DV, the supplement contains collagen, hyaluronic acid, glutamine, turmeric, broccoli seed extract, vitamin C, and vitamin E.
Collagen helps support healthy skin, bones, joints, and other types of connective tissue, and the other ingredients in this supplement may also possess some beauty benefits ( 10 ).
Reviewers say the product really seems to help with their skin, but it’s unlikely that this is because of the biotin content. Additionally, the product is not third-party tested, but is produced in a cGMP facility.

How to choose a biotin supplement
Here are some things to consider when shopping for a  biotin  supplement:
Third-party testing.  It’s best to choose a supplement that has undergone third-party testing to ensure quality and purity. Many supplements on this list are third-party tested, and the rest are manufactured in CGMP certified facilities with in-house testing protocols.
Allergies and dietary needs.  Also consider any allergies or dietary considerations you may have. Klaire Labs and Pure Encapsulations offer hypoallergenic biotin supplements, while Garden of Life offers  organic , vegan-friendly options.
Supplement type.  As with any supplement, you’ll want to choose the form — softgel, gummy, or liquid — that’s easiest and most convenient for you to take.
Your goals.  If you don’t need to supplement with biotin but are looking to improve the quality of your hair, skin, and nails, choose a supplement specifically formulated for this purpose. It’ll likely contain additional ingredients that support your goals.
Keep in mind that there’s little evidence to support the use of  biotin for hair , nail, or skin health. Consuming a healthy, well-rounded diet will do much more for your hair, skin, and nails than taking a supplement.
Biotin supplements can also affect certain lab tests, such as those used to measure thyroid hormones or heart damage, potentially leading to false results. This could lead to the misdiagnosis of serious medical conditions, which could be dangerous and even deadly ( 1 ,  3 ).
As a result, it’s important to talk with a healthcare professional before taking a biotin supplement.
Finally, because all the supplements below contain high amounts of biotin, it’s important not to take more than the manufacturer’s recommended dose.

A comparison of the best biotin supplements

Frequently asked questions
Biotin supplements are most commonly used to promote healthy hair or nail growth. Some of the symptoms of  biotin deficiency  are hair loss, skin changes, and brittle nails ( 1 ).
However, there’s limited evidence to support this particular use for biotin because most people aren’t deficient in biotin — despite its popularity as a  hair, skin, and nails vitamin  ( 12 ).
However, some populations are at risk of biotin deficiency and may benefit from a supplement, including those with alcohol use disorder, those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and those with a biotinidase deficiency, which affects how the body metabolizes biotin ( 1 ).
The daily Adequate Intake (AI) levels for biotin for adults are as follows ( 1 ):
Men:  30 mcg
Women:  30 mcg
Pregnancy:  30 mcg
Breastfeeding:  35 mcg
The AI levels for biotin are believed to meet the needs of at least 50% of the population, until more research is conducted regarding biotin needs.
Most biotin supplements contain significantly higher amounts than the AI. The supplements on this list provide 830–33,333% of the DV for biotin. Fortunately, there’s no evidence that high doses are directly harmful ( 1 ).
However, high doses of biotin can interfere with lab tests by falsely skewing thyroid hormone levels, vitamin D levels, or other results, which could have a significant impact on your medical care ( 1 ,  13 ).
Be sure to let a healthcare professional know if you’re taking a biotin supplement prior to having lab work done.
Biotin doesn’t appear to be linked to any notable  side effects . Some people report skin rashes or digestive upset after taking a biotin supplement, but there’s currently no research on specific biotin side effects.
Remember, however, that biotin may interfere with lab testing results. Biotin supplements may also interfere with anticonvulsant medications, so make sure to speak with a healthcare professional before taking biotin if you’re on an anticonvulsant ( 1 ).
Biotin deficiency is rare, but if you’re deficient in biotin you may experience ( 1 ):
hair thinning or hair loss
red, scaly skin rash
conjunctivitis, or pink eye
brittle nails
fatigue
seizures
If you suspect biotin deficiency, speak with a healthcare professional about confirming it with a blood test.
Taking too much biotin from supplements may cause falsely high or low thyroid hormone or vitamin D levels. For this reason, it’s important to notify your healthcare professional prior to having bloodwork done if you’re taking biotin or a hair, skin, and nails supplement ( 1 ,  13 ).
According to one study, blood biotin level reaches its peak 2–4 hours after taking a biotin supplement. But the study noted that your biotin may still be elevated above normal even at 24 hours after taking a supplement ( 14 ).
For this reason, your healthcare professional may ask you to stop taking biotin supplements for 48 hours prior to having bloodwork done ( 14 ).

How to Read Supplement Labels Like a Pro

The bottom line
Biotin  is an essential vitamin that helps regulate energy metabolism and cellular function. It’s also a key ingredient in many hair, skin, and nails supplements.
Most people don’t need to take biotin supplements, but there are a variety of options for those who do, including softgels, gummies, and liquids.
Just make sure to choose a product that’s produced by a reputable manufacturer with a cGMP certified facility and is third-party tested to ensure accuracy and purity.
These biotin supplements are all great options. That said, as with any supplement, speak with a healthcare professional before adding a biotin supplement to your routine.
