Title: The 13 Best Grocery Delivery Services

Grocery delivery can be a convenient option when you have a busy lifestyle, lack easy access to grocery stores in your vicinity, want to social distance, or are home sick.
Several grocery delivery services are now available, offering a wide variety of options, price points, and delivery times. Some also cater to unique or specific dietary needs.
The factors used to rank these grocery delivery services include delivery time, pricing, geographic availability, and the variety of food offered — such as whether they include fresh produce and frozen or refrigerated foods.
The best grocery delivery services offer same-day delivery, are available nationwide, and cater to all dietary needs and preferences. They also offer fresh produce and frozen or refrigerated foods, have an optional cost-saving membership option, and are reasonably priced.
Here are the top 13 grocery delivery services.

How we chose
Here’s how we chose the best grocery delivery services:
Fees and membership options.  All grocery delivery services have some fees involved, but we tried to choose those that offered cost-saving memberships for people who order grocery delivery regularly.
Product availability.  There are many small grocery delivery services that offer a very narrow selection of groceries, but the ones on this list offer a wide selection of many different types of grocery items — comparable to what you may find at your local grocery store.
Quality and reliability.  All of these services are large, popular, and widely used. They also provide groceries at a variety of quality levels to meet the needs of various households.
Service area.  While there are many small grocers across the country that offer delivery, we focused on nationwide and regional services for this article. Although not all of the services on this list are available nationwide, they are all available in multiple states or large parts of the country.

How to choose a grocery delivery service
First and foremost, choosing a grocery delivery service depends on which services are available in your area. If you live in a large city, you’ll have many more options than if you live in a more rural area.
Next, you’ll want to consider which delivery service offers food that fits your dietary needs and preferences.
For example, you may want to evaluate whether it also offers  staple foods , fresh produce, and frozen or refrigerated foods, or whether you’d need to make an additional grocery order from a different service for those items.
Then, you should consider pricing and how often you plan to use the delivery service. If you’re only going to use grocery delivery services infrequently — for example, less than once per month — you’ll want to choose the service that has the lowest per-order fees.
However, if you plan to use grocery delivery regularly, you’ll want to consider a membership option that would give you the best bang for your buck.
Finally, you’ll want to weigh other factors, like the availability of same-day delivery, if they have an app or just a website, and how their customer service is.
One additional consideration you’ll want to make is that — regardless of the delivery service you choose — tipping your delivery person is customary.

Healthline’s picks for best grocery delivery services
Price:  $7.95-$9.95 for one-time orders; membership is $12.95/month or $98/year for free unlimited delivery on orders over $35
Best for:  Walmart shoppers
Walmart offers a wide variety of products to suit all dietary needs, and because they don’t outsource their delivery service, the prices are the same as they are in the store. If you plan to use Walmart+ delivery at least once per month, paying for an annual membership is the most price-effective option.
If you have any issues with your order, you can contact Walmart customer service through the app or email, or directly at the store you ordered from. Additionally, if Walmart is out of whatever brand name product your order, your courier will OK a substitution with you.

same variety of products as Walmart stores

Price:  $3.99+ for one-time orders (plus variable service fees); membership is $9.99/month or $99/year for free delivery and reduced service fees on orders over $35
Best for:  nationwide availability
Instacart  is a grocery delivery service that partners with grocery store chains to provide delivery from a variety of stores. As such, they offer a wide variety of products to suit all dietary needs. Some grocery store chains like Kroger partner with Instacart to provide grocery delivery services directly through their own website or app. Instacart personal shoppers may text you while picking your order to make substitutions if needed, and you can contact Instacart support through their app or email. One potential downside of Instacart is that certain items may have higher prices on the Instacart platform than they do in stores, in addition to delivery and service fees. To get the best value from Instacart if you use it regularly, join the Instacart Express membership program and make sure all of your orders meet the $35 minimum for free delivery.

Like Instacart,  Shipt  is a grocery delivery service that partners with grocery chains to offer delivery from a variety of stores. Because of this, it caters to all dietary needs and preferences. The most price-effective membership option is the annual one, which works out to about $8 per month. Individual items may still be marked up to a higher price for this service. You may also be eligible for a free Shipt membership with a Visa credit card. Additionally, Target’s grocery delivery partner is Shipt.

Best for:  Target shoppers
While Target has a small in-house delivery program available in a few large cities, the majority of its grocery delivery is handled by Shipt, a grocery delivery service similar to Instacart. Through Target, you’re able to get delivery with Shipt without purchasing a membership for a $9.99 fee.
However, becoming a Shipt member and making sure that all of your orders meet the $35 threshold for free shipping is the most price-effective way to use the service. If you’re not set on delivery, the Target app and website offers convenient drive-up service.

Kroger partners with Instacart for their grocery delivery service, but you can place your order directly through the Kroger app or website — ensuring that you pay the same price as you would in the store or for grocery pickup. Kroger also has a ship-to-home option in which certain  non-perishable foods  and household products can be ordered online and shipped to your home, with free shipping over $35. There doesn’t appear to be a membership option for Kroger delivery orders placed directly through Kroger’s website or app.

When you order directly through Safeway, there doesn’t appear to be a membership option.
Safeway customer service can be reached via email, phone, or their app, as well as directly through the store you placed your order with. However, if your order was delivered through Instacart, you will need to contact Instacart to resolve any issues.

If you plan to order Publix delivery regularly, the most price-saving option is to sign up for Instacart Express and only place orders that meet the $35 minimum threshold for free shipping. If you need customer service, you will need to contact Instacart as opposed to Publix.
