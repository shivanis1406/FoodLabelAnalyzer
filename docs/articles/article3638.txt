Healthline’s picks for the best health coach certifications
Price:  $5,999
Program length:  20 weeks
Online courses can feel a bit isolating at times, but this health coach certification program is interactive. It includes live sessions two times a week so you can receive real-time feedback and learn with your cohort.
Yet the 20-week training program is somewhat flexible, as it includes 50 hours of self-paced video lessons and 1-on-1 faculty sessions for closer instruction. Though the video lessons are self-paced, you’re still expected to complete the program within the 20-week timeframe.
The program is NBHWC-approved, which means once you graduate from it, you’re eligible to apply for certification to become a National Board Certified Health & Wellness Coach (NBC-HWC).
After graduation, you’re also eligible for complimentary career support through MindBodyGreen’s alumni program. The company says the program includes 20 hours of annual education for ongoing support and development.
Another perk is that the program allows you to request the syllabus so you can review the expectations before committing. The website also gives a general overview of each week’s curriculum without needing to make a request.

This program qualifies for continuing education credits with the NBHWC, but it’s not considered an NBHWC-approved program.

This master level program helps its graduates prepare for NBHWC certification. In fact, one option with this program includes an  Advanced Health Coaching Intensive  live course that includes an NBHWC practice exam.
You can also choose a self-study program if you would rather skip live sessions in a small group. However, this route doesn’t include the NBHWC practice exam.

A comparison of the best health coach certifications

How we chose the best health coach certifications
While looking for the best health coach certification programs, we considered:
Variety:  We include programs that allow you to customize your training so you can choose a curriculum most focused on your interests. We also show certifications for those already working in the field who want to boost their resume, as well as training for those new to the industry.
Pricing:  Cost can vary quite a bit. We include options for a wide range of budgets.
Class type and length:  Some options include live sessions, while others are self-paced videos only. Some options are self-study exams, which can wrap up quickly, while others can take several weeks or up to one year to complete.
We also considered  National Board for Health and Wellness Coaching (NBHWC) approval .
The NBHWC  approves  some certification programs, which will help those new to the field gain credibility to begin working by passing the  NBHWC National Board Exam .
Passing this exam is considered the gold standard in the health coaching field. We include NBHWC-approved certifications on our list, as well as others without NBHWC approval, simply designed for existing health coach workers to boost their portfolio.
“All NBHWC ATPs [approved training programs] must meet the standards required for eligibility to sit for the board-certifying exam,” explains Lizzy Miller, MS, MPH, NBC-HWC, RDN, Associate Director of Coaching Excellence at RVO Health.
“ATPs complete a rigorous initial and annual evaluation process, demonstrating excellence in curriculum, faculty qualifications, and student support,” Miller says.
“Before enrolling in such an intense program, take time to reflect, as this is a time and financial commitment. Consider why you want to become an NBC-HWC and what having this credential will do for you personally and professionally,” Miller continues. “Determine your learning style and seek programs that align with your needs and preferences.”

Advice from certified health coaches
So, what should you consider before you commit to a health coach certification program? We went straight to the sources and asked experienced coaches for their takes.
“I would say the two most important factors in choosing a health coaching program are program applicability and cost,” says Kaitlin Brooke Feehan, MPH, BS, NBC-HWC, Health Coach at Real Appeal, RVO Health.
Miller agrees. “Of course, cost is a factor when shopping around for coach training programs, as most programs cost an average of $4,000 to $5,000. When looking beyond the financials, I recommend anyone interested in completing coach training look for programs offering various learning modalities and application-based mentoring.”
“Two big things to keep in mind are accreditation and the format of the program…,” Schneider adds. “Make sure respected organizations like NBHWC or ICF accredit the program you choose — this ensures you’re getting top-notch training that meets industry standards while factoring your budget for these certifications.”
“Secondly, think about how the training is delivered: online, in-person, self-paced, or structured. Pick a format that fits your schedule and learning style, whether that’s squeezing in study time around a busy job or attending classes in person,” Schneider continues. “Finding the right balance of quality and flexibility sets you up for success in your health coaching journey!”
If you haven’t already, you may want to consider starting with an undergraduate education program at a college or university since having an associate degree or higher is one of the NBHWC exam  requirements .
However, you may be able to skip this requirement if you can prove you have  4,000 hours  of work experience.
Full NBHWC exam requirements include:
complete an NBHWC-approved training program
complete 50 health and wellness coaching sessions
have an associate’s degree or higher  or  4,000 hours of work experience in any field
Keep in mind that some people are considered health coaches without any certification. These coaches should be transparent with clients about their qualifications without making any misleading claims about their credentials.

It’s not unusual for people without certifications to call themselves a health coach (especially thanks to digital factors like a large social media following).
Only someone who completed or passed a certification program should call themselves a “certified” health coach, though each program varies in its curriculum and may or may not be NBHWC-approved.
It’s important to be transparent about whether you have any certifications or other formal training so potential clients understand your background — plus, you’ll also avoid any claims of false advertising.

Health coaches guide clients to better well-being through individualized support, planning, resources, and more.
Aspiring health coaches can find certification programs online that may allow them to sit for the National Board Certification Exam. This is considered the gold standard in this growing industry.
Existing health coaches can consider shorter certification programs to elevate their resumes. Be sure to check out the requirements and curriculum ahead of time to ensure you enter a program that best fits your goals.
