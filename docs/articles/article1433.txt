Title: The 14 Most Nutrient-Dense Vegetables

While all vegetables are nutritious, some are more nutritious than others. If you’re looking to spice up your diet with nutrient-dense veggies, try adding spinach, broccoli, garlic, beets, or others to the menu.
It’s no secret that vegetables — which are loaded with fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants — are a must-have in a healthy diet.
Although all vegetables are healthy, several stand out for their supply of nutrients and powerful health benefits.
Here are 14 of the most nutrient-dense veggies available.

1. Spinach
This leafy green tops the chart as one of the most nutrient-dense vegetables.
That’s because  1 cup (30 grams (g))  of raw  spinach  provides 16% of the Daily Value (DV) for vitamin A plus 120% of the DV for vitamin K — all for just 7 calories.
Spinach also boasts antioxidants, which  may help  reduce your chance of developing diseases such as cancer.

2. Carrots
Carrots  are  packed with vitamin A , delivering 119% of the DV in just  1 cup (128 g) . It also contains nutrients like vitamin C and potassium.
They also contain beta-carotene, an antioxidant that  provides  them with a vibrant orange color. Your body converts it into vitamin A.
One  study  of more than 57,000 people associated eating at least 2–4 carrots per week with a 17% lower risk of colorectal cancer in the long run.
A  review of 18 studies  also found that carrots may also reduce the chance of developing lung cancer.

3. Broccoli
Just  1 cup (91 g)  of raw  broccoli  provides 77% of the DV for vitamin K, 90% of the DV for vitamin C, and a good amount of  folate , manganese, and potassium.
Broccoli  is  rich  in a sulfur-containing plant compound called glucosinolate, as well as its byproduct  sulforaphane . It  may  be able to help protect against cancer, as well as  decrease  inflammation linked to chronic conditions like heart disease.

4. Garlic
Garlic  is very nutritious while fairly low on calories, and most people usually consume a small amount as an ingredient in cooking. One clove of  garlic  only has about  4.5 calories . It contains nutrients such as  selenium , vitamin C, vitamin B6, and fiber,
It has also been  used  as a medicinal plant for millennia. Its main active compound is allicin, which has been shown to aid blood sugar and heart health.
Although further research is needed,  test-tube and animal studies  also suggest that allicin has powerful cancer-fighting properties.

5. Brussels sprouts
are a great source of  fiber , an important nutrient that  supports  bowel regularity, heart health, and blood sugar control. Each  serving  is also packed with folate, magnesium, and potassium, as well as vitamins A, C, and K.
They also contain kaempferol, an antioxidant that  may be  particularly effective in preventing cell damage.
Kaempferol  has also been shown  to have anti-inflammatory and cancer-fighting properties, which may protect against disease.

6. Kale
Only 1 cup (21 g)  of raw  kale  is loaded with potassium, calcium, copper, and vitamins A, B, C, and K.
In one small study, eating kale alongside a high carb meal was  more effective  at preventing  blood sugar spikes  than eating a high carb meal alone.
Consuming Kale as a powder (made from dried leaves) or drinking its juice has been found in various studies to  support decreasing  blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels. That said, more research is needed to confirm these findings regarding kale juice specifically.

7. Green peas
Peas  are a  starchy vegetable , which means they have more carbs and calories than non-starchy veggies and may affect blood sugar levels when eaten in large amounts.
Nevertheless, just  1 cup (160 g)  contains 9 g of fiber, 9 g of protein, and vitamins A, C, and K, as well as riboflavin,  thiamine , niacin, and folate.
Because they’re high in fiber, peas  support digestive health  by enhancing the  beneficial bacteria in your gut .
Moreover, they are rich in saponins, a group of plant compounds that  may help reduce  tumor growth and cause cancer cell death.

8. Swiss chard
One  cup (36 g)  of  Swiss chard  contains just 7 calories but nearly 1 g of fiber, 1 g of protein, and lots of manganese,  magnesium , and vitamins A, C, and K.
It’s also loaded with health-promoting antioxidants and plant compounds, including betalains and flavonoids.
Though more studies are needed,  research  has found these compounds may be anti-inflammatory and help reduce the chance of various chronic diseases

9. Beets
Beets  are a vibrant, versatile  root vegetable  that packs fiber, folate, and manganese into each serving with very  few calories .
They’re also rich in nitrates, which your body converts into nitric oxide — a compound that can help dilate blood vessels. This  may help  reduce blood pressure and  lower the chance  of developing heart disease.
What’s more, beets and their juice  have been linked  to improved endurance and athletic performance.

10. Asparagus
Just  1/2 cup (90 g)  of cooked  asparagus  provides 33% of the DV for folate, as well as plenty of selenium, vitamin K, thiamine, and riboflavin.
Getting enough folate from foods such as asparagus  may protect  against disease and prevent developmental irregularities of the neural tube  during pregnancy .
One  animal study  also suggests that asparagus extract protects against liver and kidney damage by reducing oxidative stress.

11. Red cabbage
Just  1 cup (89 g)  of raw red  cabbage  contains 2 g of fiber and 56% of the DV for  vitamin C .
It’s also rich in  anthocyanins , a group of plant compounds that  contribute  to its distinct color and numerous benefits.
In one  animal study , red cabbage extract reversed oxidative stress in rats with high cholesterol levels.
Similarly, in another  study  of mice fed a high fat diet, red cabbage  microgreens  significantly lowered levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and decreased weight gain.

12. Sweet potatoes
One medium  sweet potato  contains about 4 g of fiber, 2 g of protein, and a good amount of potassium, manganese, and vitamins B6 and C.
This root veggie is also high in beta-carotene, packing  122%  of the DV for this vitamin.
According to a  review of in vitro and animal 23 studies ,  sweet potatoes  may be particularly effective for regulating blood sugar and cholesterol levels. However, human studies are needed

13. Collard greens
A mere  1 cup (130 g)  of cooked  collard greens  boasts about 6 g of fiber, 4 g of protein, and 25% of the DV for calcium.
In fact, collard greens are one of the best  plant sources of calcium . which is a mineral that  plays a key role  in muscle function, nerve transmission, hormone production, and bone health.
Some research links an increased intake of specific vegetables, including collard greens, to a  lower chance  of developing glaucoma, an eye condition that can lead to blindness ( 50 ).
Another review also associated a higher intake of  cruciferous vegetables  such as collard greens with an  8% and 19% lower risk  of colorectal and stomach cancers, respectively.

14. Cauliflower
Cauliflower  is known for both its versatility and its stellar nutrient profile. Just  1 cup (155 g)  cooked packs 3 g of fiber, 3 g of protein, and a variety of other important nutrients, including folate and vitamins C and K.
Like other cruciferous veggies, it
It’s a  great source  of compounds such as glucosinolates and isothiocyanates, both of which possess potent cancer-fighting properties.
Cauliflower is also often used as a low carb alternative and  may help  support weight loss.
