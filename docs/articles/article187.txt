Title: 4 Potential Side Effects of Valerian Root

The herbal sleep aid valerian root has been linked to causing vivid dreams, heart palpitations, headaches, and dry mouth. It can also interact with certain medications and substances.
Valerian root is used to improve sleep, relieve anxiety, ease menopausal symptoms, and promote relaxation. It’s commonly taken as a capsule, liquid extract, or tea.
Reports of its effectiveness are mixed and largely based on anecdotal evidence. Some people report side effects, but they are usually  reported at higher doses .
Here are 4 possible side effects of valerian root and other information you should know.

1. Vivid dreams
A  2021 study  found that strange and vivid dreams are a side effect of  valerian root  at higher doses.
Some  researchers believe  that valerian boosts the brain chemical gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which has a calming effect on your body. Overall, these sedative properties may promote  deeper sleep patterns  that could lead to  vivid dreams .
For this reason, valerian root is not typically recommended for people who are prone to unpleasant dreams, as it could cause nightmares.

2. Heart palpitations
Heart palpitations  feel like a rapid or fluttering heartbeat.
Though typically harmless, heart palpitations can cause anxiety if you’re not used to them. They can be triggered by stress, medication, exercise, and some medical conditions.
High doses of valerian root  may produce  heart rate changes.

3. Dry mouth and upset stomach
Valerian root may cause mild to moderate mouth and gastrointestinal effects.
A  2024 research review  found that several studies reported diarrhea as a side effect of valerian root. Nausea was also reported.
In  2021 research , dry mouth was reported after taking valerian root, but this has not been as extensively studied.

4. Headaches
Although valerian root has historically been used to relieve headaches,  some research  found an increase in headaches after using the herb.
Most of these side effects seem to happen only after long-term or high dose use. Aside from headaches, changes in mood, such as excitability and uneasiness, have also occurred.
Some  people also report  feeling more sluggish the morning after taking valerian root, especially at high doses.
If you experience any of these side effects, you may want to lower your dosage.

Potential interactions
As with other herbs, you should be cautious when using valerian root at the same time as other medications and substances.
Though serious side effects appear to be rare, some sources report that valerian root  may interact  with:
alcohol
antidepressants
sedatives, such as anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, and sleep aids
narcotics
statins (cholesterol-lowering medications)
some antifungal drugs
antihistamines
St. John’s wort
Valerian root  should not  be taken in high doses or with substances used for similar reasons, such as sedatives or sleep aids.
Using this herb with some of these substances may cause excessive sleepiness or worsen depression. There are a small number of cases linking valerian root to  mild to moderate liver damage . Recovery took 2 to 4 months after stopping.
Young children and people who are pregnant or nursing should avoid valerian root due to a lack of safety information.
Keep in mind that this herb is considered a dietary supplement and not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Thus, it’s best to look for products that have been independently tested for purity by organizations like  NSF International  or  ConsumerLab .
Always remember that valerian should not replace prescription medications. If you’re unsure how to use valerian root, seek advice from a medical professional.

Proper dosage and excessive intake
Research is mixed when it comes to the best dosage of valerian root. Many studies are small and the dosage has varied widely, making it difficult to determine an optimal dose.
The  general recommended dose  of valerian for sleep issues is 300 to 600 milligrams (mg).
It’s important to talk with a doctor before starting any new supplement. They can let you know if any of your medications will interact with valerian root and help you decide if taking it is right for you.

Takeaway
Valerian root is a popular sleep aid that’s widely considered safe.
Still, some people have reported several minor side effects, such as vivid dreams, heart palpitations, dry mouth, digestive upset, and headaches.
Before taking valerian root, contact a doctor. They can help you decide if taking it is safe for you.
