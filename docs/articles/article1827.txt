Title: 6 Unique Health Benefits of Mamey Fruit

Also known by its scientific name,  Pouteria sapota , mamey sapote is a type of tree found throughout Mexico and Central America.
It produces large fruit with a soft, creamy texture, vibrant orange hue, and unique flavor that’s often compared to sweet potatoes, pumpkins, and apricots.
In addition to being delicious and easy to enjoy, this tropical fruit is incredibly nutritious and may be associated with several potential health benefits.
Here are 6 of the top benefits of mamey fruit.

1. Rich in nutrients
Mamey fruit is highly nutritious, packing significant amounts of fiber, vitamins, and minerals into each serving.
One cup (175 grams) of raw mamey fruit provides ( 1 ):
Calories:  217
Protein:  2.5 grams
Fat:  1 gram
Carbs:  56 grams
Fiber:  9.5 grams
Vitamin B6:  74% of the Daily Value (DV)
Vitamin C:  45% of the DV
Copper:  41% of the DV
Vitamin E:  25% of the DV
Potassium:  17% of the DV
Riboflavin:  16% of the DV
Niacin:  16% of the DV
Manganese:  16% of the DV
Pantothenic acid:  14% of the DV
Iron:  8% of the DV
Mamey fruit is particularly high in  vitamin B6 , a water-soluble vitamin involved in protein metabolism, brain function, immune health, and more ( 2 ).
It’s also a good source of vitamin C, a micronutrient that protects against inflammation and cell damage ( 3 ).
Plus, mamey fruit is loaded with  copper , which your body needs to produce red blood cells and connective tissue ( 4 ).

2. May support digestive health
With a whopping 9.5 grams of  fiber  in each cup (175 grams), adding mamey fruit to your diet is a great way to keep your digestive system running smoothly ( 1 ).
Fiber moves slowly through the body undigested, helping add bulk to stools to ease their passage ( 5 ).
Studies show that increasing your intake of fiber can increase the frequency of bowel movements and improve the consistency of stool to  prevent constipation  ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
Plus, following a high fiber diet may protect against other issues like hemorrhoids or diverticulitis, a condition characterized by inflammation of the small pouches in the lining of the digestive tract ( 5 ).

3. Helps keep skin healthy
Due to its rich nutritional content, mamey fruit can supply many of the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants your body needs to keep your skin glowing and smooth.
It’s especially high in vitamin C, which stimulates the synthesis of  collagen , a type of protein that promotes skin elasticity and slows signs of aging ( 8 ,  9 ).
Vitamin C may also promote wound healing, reduce inflammation, and protect against ultraviolet (UV)-induced skin damage ( 8 ).
Additionally, mamey fruit is a great source of  vitamin E , a micronutrient commonly featured in skin care products due to its antioxidant content.
Vitamin E is often used to speed wound healing, reduce acne, and treat conditions like atopic dermatitis and psoriasis ( 10 ).

4. Protects against anemia
Anemia  is a condition that affects the body’s ability to produce red blood cells, causing symptoms like weakness, fatigue, brittle nails, and shortness of breath ( 11 ).
Mamey fruit is rich in several vitamins and minerals that your body needs to produce red blood cells, including iron, copper, and vitamin B6 ( 1 ).
A deficiency in any of these essential  micronutrients  can reduce the number of healthy red blood cells in your body, which can cause anemia ( 12 ,  13 ,  14 ).
For this reason, enjoying mamey fruit as part of a well-rounded diet can ensure that you’re getting the vitamins and minerals you need to help prevent anemia.

5. May enhance heart health
With plenty of fiber,  potassium , and antioxidants in each serving, mamey fruit can have a powerful effect on heart health.
Fiber is especially beneficial. It may significantly reduce cholesterol levels, a key risk factor for heart disease ( 5 ,  15 ).
What’s more, a review of 18 studies found that eating more fiber — especially fiber from fruits — may be linked to a lower chance of developing heart disease ( 16 ).
Potassium, another mineral found in mamey fruit, also helps regulate fluid balance and blood pressure levels ( 17 ).
Getting enough potassium in your diet by enjoying  nutrient-dense foods  like mamey fruit may help prevent high blood pressure and protect against heart disease ( 18 ).
Furthermore, mamey fruit is rich in antioxidants, which reduce oxidative stress, alleviate inflammation, and prevent heart disease ( 19 ,  20 ).

6. Improves immunity
Mamey fruit is an excellent source of vitamin C, which is an  antioxidant  that may enhance immune function.
In fact, research shows that vitamin C can improve immunity by reducing inflammation, neutralizing harmful free radicals, strengthening the barrier of the digestive tract, and promoting the production of immune cells ( 21 ).
Some research suggests that vitamin C may also shorten the duration of the common cold and prevent other types of respiratory infections ( 22 ).
However, most studies focus on  vitamin C supplements  rather than food sources. As such, more research is needed on how vitamin-C-containing foods like mamey fruit could affect immunity.
However, mamey fruit contains several other nutrients involved in the production of immune cells, including vitamin E, vitamin B6, and copper ( 2 ,  23 ,  24 ).

The bottom line
Mamey fruit is a tropical food known for its unique taste and texture.
In addition to supplying a hearty dose of fiber, copper, and vitamins B6 and C in each serving, it may offer several health benefits.
In particular, adding mamey fruit to your diet may help enhance immune function, promote regularity, prevent anemia, and support the health of your heart and skin.
Try this today : Although you can enjoy mamey fruit as is by simply scooping out the flesh, it also makes a great addition to smoothies. Combine some milk, cinnamon, vanilla, and mamey fruit with your choice of sweetener. Then, blend and enjoy.
