Title: 7 Surprising Benefits of Parsley Tea (And How to Make It)



Parsley tea is associated with many impressive health benefits.
Made by steeping fresh or dried parsley in a cup of hot water, it can supply several nutrients and antioxidants that are essential to health.
Plus, it’s easy to prepare, cost-effective, and delicious, making it a great addition to a healthy diet.
Here are 7 surprising benefits of parsley tea.

1. High in Antioxidants
Parsley is an excellent  source of antioxidants  — powerful compounds that help defend your cells against damage by potentially harmful molecules known as free radicals.
Antioxidants are thought to play a central role in health and disease, with some research indicating that they could protect against chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer ( 1 ).
According to one test-tube study, parsley extract was able to prevent DNA damage and block the spread of cancer cells — mostly due to its antioxidant content ( 2 ).
Another study showed that treating rats with concentrated amounts of parsley increased total antioxidant status and decreased several markers of oxidative stress ( 3 ).
In particular, parsley is a good source of flavonoids, carotenoids, ascorbic acid, and tocopherol ( 4 ).

2. Could Help Prevent Kidney Stones
Kidney stones  are hard mineral deposits that form in your kidneys and cause severe, sharp pain in your back, side, and stomach.
Some research suggests that parsley may aid in preventing kidney stones.
One study found that treating rats with parsley helped increase urine volume, decrease urinary calcium excretion, and raise the acidity of urine ( 5 ).
Parsley has also been shown to act as a natural  diuretic , which can increase urination and prevent kidney stone formation ( 6 ,  7 ).
Still, studies on the effects of parsley tea in humans are limited, and some research has found that it may have minimal impact on kidney stone risk factors ( 8 ).
Therefore, further studies are needed.

3. Good Source of Vitamin C
Parsley is rich in vitamin C.
In fact, a 1/4-cup (15-gram) serving provides nearly 20 mg of  vitamin C  — about 22% of the recommended daily value ( 9 ).
Vitamin C is an important water-soluble vitamin that also acts as an antioxidant and plays an integral role in preventing disease ( 10 ).
Some research suggests that it protects against infections, such as pneumonia and the common cold ( 11 ).
It’s also involved in the synthesis of  collagen  — a protein found in your skin, bones, muscles, joints, tendons, and other parts of your body ( 12 ).
Vitamin C is necessary for wound healing, nutrient absorption, and bone formation as well ( 13 ,  14 ).
Thus, adding parsley or parsley tea to your diet may help you reach your vitamin C needs, keeping you healthy.

4. May Have Cancer-Fighting Properties
Parsley tea is loaded with antioxidants and  cancer-fighting compounds .
For example, apigenin, a flavonoid in parsley, has been shown to block the growth and spread of cancer cells in test-tube studies ( 15 ,  16 ).
Luteolin is another flavonoid in parsley that may suppress tumor growth, thus aiding cancer prevention, according to some test-tube studies ( 17 ).
What’s more, one test-tube study found that parsley extract was able to prevent DNA damage and decrease the spread of breast cancer cells by 41% ( 2 ).
Keep in mind that most of the present research focuses on how specific compounds in parsley may impact cancer development in a lab.
Additional research is needed to understand how parsley tea may affect cancer cell growth in humans.

5. Could Help Regulate Menstruation
Parsley tea is commonly used as a natural remedy to treat issues related to menstruation and  hormone levels .
In particular, it contains the compounds myristicin and apiole, which can influence estrogen production to help balance hormones ( 18 ).
It’s also thought to act as an emmenagogue — a substance that stimulates menstrual flow ( 19 ).
For this reason, parsley tea is often found in formulations designed to support healthy menstruation and prevent the overproduction of milk for  breastfeeding mothers .
However, research on the effects of parsley tea on menstruation and milk production is currently limited and mostly based on anecdotal evidence.
Further studies are needed to evaluate the potential effects of parsley tea in humans.

6. May Promote Blood Sugar Control
In many parts of the world, such as Turkey, parsley is used as a natural way to help lower blood sugar levels.
Interestingly, some recent studies have confirmed that parsley tea may have antidiabetic properties and could help support better  blood sugar control .
For example, one study showed that treating rats with diabetes with parsley helped improve liver health while also reducing blood sugar levels ( 20 ).
Similarly, another study in rats with diabetes found that parsley led to significant decreases in blood sugar levels and body weight ( 21 ).
Still, more research is needed to determine whether the blood-sugar-lowering properties of parsley tea apply to people.

7. Easy to Make and Delicious
Parsley tea is soothing, delicious, and can be made with just a few ingredients.
Start by boiling one cup (250 ml) of water in a small pot or saucepan.
Next, prepare the parsley by rinsing off 1/4 cup (15 grams) of fresh parsley and chopping it up.
Alternatively, you can use two tablespoons (1 gram) of dried parsley.
Add the dried or fresh parsley to the bottom of your cup and pour water over it, allowing it to steep for 5–10 minutes.
Finally, use a mesh strainer to remove and discard the parsley leaves before enjoying your hot drink.
Parsley tea can be consumed as is or flavored with a bit of  honey , lemon juice, or sugar.

Potential Side Effects
Though parsley and parsley tea are associated with  several benefits , you should consider the potential side effects as well.
In particular, pregnant women are advised to avoid consuming large amounts of parsley, as it may induce uterine contractions ( 18 ).
It’s also high in vitamin K, an important fat-soluble vitamin involved in blood clotting ( 9 ).
If you’re taking a blood thinner like warfarin (Coumadin), it may be best to drink parsley tea in moderation, as high amounts of vitamin K may interact with these medications.
Parsley tea is also not recommended for those taking diuretics, as it may cause excess water loss.

The Bottom Line
Parsley tea is rich in important nutrients and antioxidants and can be a great addition to a well-balanced,  healthy diet .
Though most research is limited to test-tube and animal studies, parsley tea has been associated with several benefits. For example, it may help regulate menstruation, fight kidney stone formation, and improve blood sugar control.
Best of all, it’s soothing, delicious, and easy to prepare using just a few simple ingredients that you may already have in your kitchen.
