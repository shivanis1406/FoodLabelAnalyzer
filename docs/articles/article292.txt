Is falafel healthy?
Falafel has several qualities that may benefit your health in various ways.
To start, it’s a  good source of fiber  and plant-based protein, two nutrients that work synergistically to help keep you full for longer throughout the day.
Both fiber and protein have been shown to reduce the production of hunger hormones, such as ghrelin, while increasing the production of fullness hormones like cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide-1, and peptide YY ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
Also, studies have shown that chickpea fiber may help manage blood sugar levels by slowing carb absorption. This promotes steady rises in blood sugar rather than spikes ( 5 ,  6 ).
Moreover, chickpea fiber has been linked to improved bowel health, as well as lowered risks of heart disease and colon cancer ( 7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10 ).
Depending on what ingredients are added to falafel, they can be naturally gluten-free and dairy-free, making them a good option for most diets.
That said, falafel can have downsides, depending on how it’s prepared.
It’s typically  deep-fried  in oil, which significantly increases its calorie and fat content ( 11 ).
Studies consistently show that people who regularly consume deep-fried foods have a higher risk of obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer ( 12 ,  13 ).
What’s more, some people may have allergies to ingredients that are either in or served with falafel, such as sesame seeds.
However, making your own falafel at home can minimize these downsides.
Falafel is high in many micronutrients and a good source of fiber and protein. As such, it may help curb your appetite, support healthy blood sugar, and lower your risk of chronic disease. Yet, it’s typically deep-fried in oil, which raises its fat and calorie content.

How to make healthy falafel
Falafel is easy to make at home with only a few ingredients.
Additionally, making your own falafel allows you to bake them rather than deep-fry them, which cuts back on excess oil, fat, and calories.
The following ingredients and ratios are used to make about 12 falafel:
1 15-ounce (425-gram) can of  chickpeas , drained and rinsed
4 cloves of fresh garlic
1/2 cup (75 grams) of chopped onion
2 tablespoons of fresh, chopped parsley
1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil
3 tablespoons (30 grams) of all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon of baking powder
2 teaspoons (10 ml) of lemon juice
1 teaspoon of ground cumin
1 teaspoon of ground coriander
a pinch of salt
a pinch of ground black pepper
Here’s a quick overview of how to make falafel:
Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and grease a baking sheet with oil.
Combine the chickpeas, garlic, onion, parsley, olive oil, flour, baking powder, lemon juice, cumin,  coriander , salt, and pepper in a food processor. Pulse until combined for approximately 1 minute.
Scoop the mixture, form it into small patties, and place them onto the baking sheet.
Bake the falafel for 10–12 minutes and flip the patties. Bake them for another 10–12 minutes, until they are golden and crispy.
