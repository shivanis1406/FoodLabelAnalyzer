Title: 9 Healthy Ways to Use White Rice, According to a Dietitian

Rice is a staple food in many cultures.
It’s predominantly  produced in the Asian-Pacific  region, where it serves as an important economic crop. More than  60% of the world’s population  eats rice every day.
Compared to brown rice, white rice offers fewer nutrients, including minerals, vitamins, and dietary fiber. This disparity has led many in the West to  vilify  white rice, and there are claims that it can’t fit into a balanced diet.
However, white rice remains more widely consumed than brown rice, potentially due to cultural practices, its faster cooking time, and  its softer texture , which many people find more favorable.
Plus, it is more cost-effective and can be purchased in bulk.
For example, a bag containing 320 ounces of white rice (more than 200 standard servings) costs  less than $9 USD  at Walmart. A similarly-sized bag of brown rice is not available at the retailer. Instead, a 32-ounce bag (about 20 servings)  costs $1.37 USD .
To buy the same amount of brown rice as offered in the bulk bag of white rice, you’d need to purchase 10 32-ounce bags for more than $13, plus tax.
Therefore, it’s important that we acknowledge the roles and benefits of white rice as a cultural staple in several dietary patterns and as an affordable alternative to other grains.
We need to develop a deeper understanding of ways to use this staple food as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle.
This article explains the benefits of white rice and ways to enjoy it through balanced nutrition.

Is white rice healthy?
The scientific research on white rice’s association with various health outcomes has been inconsistent.
For instance,  some research suggests  that white rice is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes among Asian women when consumed in “extreme” amounts — but “extreme” is not well-defined with respect to the amount of white rice consumed each day.
In  other research , white rice that has been cooked and cooled before consumption in a human clinical study lowered blood sugar spikes after a meal.
This occurred because cooking the white rice then refrigerating it for 24 hours before reheating activated its resistant starch — a type of non-digestible carbohydrate that  confers benefits  for gut health and blood sugar management.
Here is how 1 cup (158 grams) of cooked parboiled  white rice  compares to 1 cup (155 grams) cooked parboiled  brown rice :
White rice offers fewer calories, fewer grams of carbs, fat, and dietary fiber, and less of the mineral  phosphorus , but comparable protein and selenium compared with brown rice.
However, it is richer in the  B vitamin   niacin  than brown rice.
This data shows that white rice offers some nutritional benefits. Consider pairing it with foods rich in dietary fiber and minerals to boost the nutritional profile of your meal.

White rice is not inherently inferior to brown rice, despite myths. It offers nutritional benefits, including some minerals. It’s low in fiber, fat, and calories, and can be paired with fiber-rich foods to boost a meal’s nutritional profile.

9 healthy ways to use white rice
Here are 9 healthy ways to enjoy white rice.
Peas and beans are rich in dietary  fiber ,  antioxidants , and other health-promoting compounds  shown to improve  blood sugar, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.
Furthermore, when peas and beans are paired with rice — including white rice — a  complete protein  is formed. A complete protein is one that provides all nine essential amino acids in sufficient amounts.
This is an especially important food combination for people who follow a vegetarian or vegan dietary pattern, since most complete proteins are animal-based foods.
Enjoy white rice with stewed lentil peas, dhal (split peas), or a black bean chili.

Like peas and beans, non-starchy vegetables are rich in dietary fiber. When included in a vegetable rice dish, they can help make up for the lower fiber content of white rice.
Vegetables also contain nutrients like calcium, vitamin C, iron, and folate that  support  lower cholesterol and blood sugar levels and may reduce the risk of  some types of cancers .
Examples include carrot rice, spinach rice, and pumpkin rice.
In an iron pot, sauté diced onion, garlic, pimento or jalapeño peppers, raisins, and shredded carrots. Stir in cooked white rice and mix evenly. Serve hot as a side dish.
A great way to build a meal using white rice is following the  balanced MyPlate method  recommended by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).
Under this guideline, about half your plate should be filled with non-starchy vegetables and fruit, a quarter of your plate with protein like meat, fish or poultry, and a quarter with grains like white rice.
This method encourages flexibility and a diversity of nutrients to be enjoyed while also helping you  eat mindful servings  of white rice.
Serve a quarter-plate of white rice with a half-plate of cooked spinach and a quarter-plate of grilled fish for a quick, balanced dinner meal.
It is impractical to enjoy all meals in the MyPlate method recommended above, as is the case with one-pot meals.
However, these can still be a nutritious and healthy way to eat white rice.
Pair one-pot dishes like pelau — a Caribbean dish made with caramelized chicken, rice, pigeon peas, herbs, spices, and vegetables — with an additional side of  non-starchy vegetables  like carrot coleslaw or tossed salad.
Other rice-based one-pot dishes, such as casseroles or South  Indian recipes  like sambar rice, can also be accompanied with a side of non-starchy vegetables for a boost of filling dietary fiber.
Rice bowls are quite popular in Asian, Persian, and Spanish cultures.
The rice may be topped with beans, vegetables like lettuce, onions, and olives, avocados for healthy fats, and sauces or gravies for flavor.
Because rice bowls use so many ingredients, that often means you’ll use smaller portions of each food, including rice, to create room for a variety of other food groups.
The inclusion of fats like  avocado  or olive oil-based dressings  encourage the absorption  of fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins A, D, E and K, and may support heart health  by lowering  low density lipoprotein (LDL or “bad”) cholesterol.
In a medium bowl, add 1/3 cup white rice, 1/3 cup black beans in tomato sauce, shredded lettuce, cabbage, carrots, red onions, red bell peppers, and corn. Drizzle with a vinaigrette or your preferred herbs and spices and enjoy. Top with grilled chicken or tofu for added protein.
In some cultures, rice bowls are also called burrito bowls.
Popular burrito toppings include lettuce, red onions, celery, or a combination of other non-starchy vegetables, corn, black beans, and cooked chicken, beef, pork, or plant-based proteins like tofu and tempeh.
If you’re making a burrito bowl that uses meat, choose lean cuts to reduce saturated fat intake.  Research shows  that a moderate intake of lean, fresh red meats is associated with lower blood pressure compared with high-fat meats.
Try topping your rice bowl with a Mongolian beef or smoked pork recipe for a burst of flavor.
Consuming fish at least twice per week  is associated with  benefits for heart, nerve, and liver health.
In addition, fish is an  important source  of protein, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory nutrients,  including  the heart-friendly omega-3 fatty acids.
Try curry fish, blackened creole fish with white rice, or a tuna fish and rice casserole. Don’t forget to include a fresh or cooked non-starchy vegetable side dish for fiber and health-promoting added nutrients.
A clever way to enjoy white rice and vegetables in a nutritious and filling yet simple dish is by making stuffed bell peppers.
Bell peppers contain  capsaicin , which is a phytochemical compound with potential  benefits against cancer  development.
This active compound in bell peppers has also  demonstrated  anti-inflammatory, blood sugar-lowering, anti-fungal, antioxidant, and other beneficial properties for human health.
Gut and remove the seeds from two large bell peppers. Bake at 350 ℉ (177 ℃) for 15–20 minutes. Combine cooked white rice, marinara ground beef, corn, and cheese, then stuff the baked bell peppers with the mixture. Top with shredded cheese and bake for another 15 minutes at 350 ℉ (177 ℃).

9. Make air-fried croquettes
A croquette is a type of dumpling that’s usually battered and deep-fried.
To make croquettes using white rice, combine 1 cup of cooked white rice with shredded, cooked, low fat turkey, shredded cheese, breadcrumbs, and eggs.
Mix well and form into balls or cylindrical shapes. Cover again with breadcrumbs, place in a lined sheet, and air-fry for 10–15 minutes at 350 ℉ (177 ℃).
Pair white rice with peas and beans, lean cuts of meat, fish, and vegetables to make balanced and nutritious dishes. White rice can also be enjoyed in one-pot meals like pelau and sambar rice or in rice bowls and stuffed bell peppers.

The bottom line
White rice is a staple food in many cultures, but its reputation has been marred with controversial scientific findings of its effects on human health.
Some research indicates that it may increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in Asian women, while other research suggests that has the potential to reduce blood sugar levels when refrigerated for one day after cooking.
However, white rice contains some minerals, is low in calories and fat, and offers nutritional benefits, so it can fit into a healthy diet. Consider pairing it with fiber-rich foods to make it more filling and to boost your intake of nutrients.
White rice can be served with peas and beans or with lean cuts of meat, fish, and vegetables to make balanced and nutritious dishes. You can also enjoy it in one-pot meals like pelau and sambar rice or in rice bowls and stuffed bell peppers.
