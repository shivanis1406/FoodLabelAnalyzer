Title: 10 Spices And Herbs That May Help Lower High Blood Pressure

Managing high blood pressure usually requires a mix of medications and a healthy diet. Certain natural ways to lower blood pressure, such as eating garlic, basil, and other herbs and spices, may also work.
High blood pressure , also called hypertension, can often be managed with medication, as well as dietary and lifestyle changes. Some herbs and spices may also help lower blood pressure.
Below are 10 herbs and spices that may help lower  blood pressure . Make sure to speak with your doctor before using any of the following herbs.

1–3. Spices
Cinnamon  ( Cinnamomum verum ) has been used for centuries in traditional medicine to  treat heart conditions , including high blood pressure.
While it’s not fully understood how cinnamon lowers blood pressure,  animal research  suggests it can help dilate and relax the blood vessels.
A  review  of nine studies of 641 participants showed that taking cinnamon reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by an average of 6.2 mm Hg and 3.9 mm Hg, respectively. This effect was stronger when people took cinnamon consistently over 12 weeks.
Cinnamon is easy to incorporate into meals. Concentrated cinnamon supplements are another option.
Cinnamon appears to help dilate and relax the blood vessels, which may help lower blood pressure.
Celery seeds  ( Apium graveolens ) are packed with various nutrients, such as:
iron
magnesium
manganese
calcium
fiber
Some research suggests celery seeds may help lower blood pressure.
One  small  study of 52 participants examined the effects of celery seed extract on blood pressure. During the 4-week study, half of the participants were given 1.34 grams of celery seed extract a day, and the other half were given placebo capsules.
Researchers noted a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the celery group. No changes were observed in the placebo group.
Researchers  have also suggested that compounds in celery seed extract may help lower blood pressure by acting as a natural calcium channel blocker.
In addition,  celery seed  is also a source of dietary  fiber , which has been  linked  to lower blood pressure.
Despite some promising results, research is limited on the effects of celery seed on blood pressure. Scientists need to conduct more human research in this area.
Some research suggests celery seeds may reduce blood pressure. This spice may be effective thanks to its fiber and action as a natural calcium channel blocker.
Cardamom  ( Elettaria cardamomum ) is packed with antioxidants that may help  lower blood pressure  and treat other symptoms of metabolic syndrome.
It may also have positive effects on:
obesity
triglyceride levels
cholesterol levels
insulin sensitivity
Cardamom is simple to incorporate into your cooking or baking. Alternatively, you could take a cardamom supplement or extract under the guidance of your doctor.
Research suggests cardamom may help lower blood pressure and have other positive effects on obestiy, triglyceride levels, cholestrol levels, and insulin sensitivity.

4–10. Herbs
Garlic  ( Allium sativum ) is rich in allicin, a compound that may  benefit your heart  and have protective effects.
A  review  of 12 studies in over 550 people with high blood pressure found that taking garlic reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by an average of 8.3 mm Hg and 5.5 mm Hg, respectively.
This reduction was similar to the effects of  blood pressure medications .
Garlic contains allicin and has been shown to help relax blood vessels and aid blood flow. Collectively, these factors may help reduce blood pressure.
Basil  ( Ocimum basilicum ) is popular in alternative medicine because it’s rich in powerful compounds.
Animal studies suggest basil may help reduce blood pressure.  In 2023,  a study  on rats with hypertension fed them antihypertensive compounds found in green basil leaves. The results  found that the plant compounds had a positive effect on the rats’ blood pressure.
More research is needed to investigate whether basil helps lower blood pressure in humans.
Basil is easy to add to a variety of meals, including scrambled eggs, salads, sauces, and more. It can also be grown as a potted plant indoors.
Basil contains compounds that may help reduce blood pressure, according to animal studies. However, more human research is needed.
Parsley  ( Petroselinum crispum ) contains a variety of compounds, such as  vitamin C  and dietary  carotenoids , that may reduce blood pressure.
In a  review  of 19 randomized controlled trials, researchers found that carotenoid supplementation is associated with lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Benefits were seen in adults who consumed 0 to 25 mg and 0 to 20 mg of carotenoids per day.
Animal studies  have shown that parsley reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by acting like a calcium channel blocker, a type of medication that helps relax and dilate blood vessels.
However, limited human research exists on parsley and blood pressure. More research is needed to better understand its effects.
Parsley contains a variety of compounds, such as dietary carotenoids, that may help lower blood pressure.
Thyme  ( Thymus vulgaris ) is packed with numerous healthy compounds, including Rosmarinic acid.
Results from an animal  study  have shown that taking rosmarinic acid helps reduce systolic blood pressure blood pressure. It inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a molecule that narrows blood vessels and raises blood pressure, so inhibiting ACE  may lower  blood pressure.
There’s limited human research on thyme and blood pressure. Scientists need to do more research to investigate these effects in humans.
Thyme contains powerful compounds, such as rosmarinic acid, that appear to help relax blood vessels in animal studies.
Ginger  ( Zingiber officinale ) is a staple in alternative medicine. For centuries, people have used it to  improve many aspects  of heart health, including:
circulation
cholesterol levels
blood pressure
Ginger may reduce blood pressure. A  review  found that along with hypotensive (blood pressure-loweirng) properties, ginger may also be:
anti-ulcer and anticholinergic
anti-inflammatory
anti-nausea
blood ciruclation-enhancing
antimicrobial
Ginger is flavorful and easy to incorporate into your diet with meals. Alternatively, you can purchase ginger supplements online. These are more concentrated.
Ginger may help lower blood pressure and provide many other protective effects.
People have  long used  Chinese cat’s claw ( Uncaria rhynchophylla,  Gou-Teng, or Chotoko) in traditional Chinese medicine to treat a variety of ailments, including  high blood pressure .
Chinese cat’s claw differs from  cat’s claw  ( Uncaria tomentosa ). Despite its similar name and appearance, cat’s claw plant has a different origin and different chemical properties.
Chinese cat’s claw contains several compounds, such as  hirsutine  and  rhynchophylline , that may stimulate blood vessels to produce  nitric oxide (NO)  and have anti-hypertensive properties. NO is a chemical compound that helps blood vessels relax and dilate.
Taking Chinese cat’s claw extract or its compounds may help reduce blood pressure and aid blood flow. However, human studies are still limited.
You can purchase Chinese cat’s claw at select health food stores or online.
Chinese cat’s claw contains the compounds hirsutine and rhynchophylline that may help blood vessels relax.
Bacopa monnieri  is used in Ayurvedic medicine use it to  treat various conditions , including:
depression
memory loss
high blood pressure
In  animal studies ,  Bacopa monnieri  helped stimulate blood vessel dilation and release of NO.
Although the findings from animal studies are promising, the effects of  Bacopa monnieri  on blood pressure in humans are still unclear. Scientists need to do more research on this herb’s effects.
You can buy  Bacopa monnieri  from health food stores and online. It’s available in several forms, including powder and capsules.
Animal research suggests the herb  Bacopa monnieri  may help blood vessels dilate and relax, lowering blood pressure.
