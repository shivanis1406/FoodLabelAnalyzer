Title: Cardio or Weightlifting: Which Is Better for Weight Loss?

Cardio and weightlifting sessions can help you burn fat and lose body weight. HIIT may lead to equal gains but in a shorter time. How quickly you lose weight with each type of exercise depends on many factors.
If you’ve decided to lose weight, you may have asked yourself a tricky question: Should you do cardio or weights?
Cardio and resistance training (including weightlifting) are popular workouts, but knowing which may help you accomplish your goals more efficiently can be hard.

Cardio burns more calories per session
You’ll generally burn more calories per  cardio session  than  weight training  for about the same effort.
However, to lose weight, you also need to burn more calories than you consume.
According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , if you weigh 154 pounds (lb), you will burn about 145 calories per 30 minutes of bicycling at a moderate pace.
If you were to bicycle at a more intense pace of 10 miles per hour or more, you could burn around 295 calories in 30 minutes. In other words, the intensity of your workout affects how many calories you burn in total during one cardio session.
On the other hand, if you lifted weights for the same 30 minutes, you might burn around 110 calories.
Also, the more you weigh, the more calories you will burn. When you begin losing weight, you may notice that you burn fewer calories per session doing the same effort.
The number of calories you burn during exercise depends on your body size and how intensely you exercise. Typically, a cardio workout burns more calories than a weight training workout of the same duration.

Weight training changes body composition and sustains caloric burn
Although a single weight-training session doesn’t typically burn as many calories as a cardio session, you could still  burn more calories overall  if you go with the first one.
Resistance and weight training are more effective than cardio at  building lean muscle , and muscle mass burns more calories at rest than other tissues, including fat.
Building muscle may help increase  resting metabolism  in some people — that is, how many calories the body burns at rest.
A  2020 systematic review  found that resistance exercise is effective at increasing resting metabolic rate compared to aerobic exercise alone or aerobic and resistance exercise combined.
The calorie-burning benefits of resistance training aren’t limited to when you are exercising. You may keep burning calories hours afterward as your body recovers from your session and repairs muscle tissue.
How much energy (calories) you expend during your recovery after a weight-training session depends on the  intensity of your session .
You can lose weight and  burn fat by lifting weights  only. The more muscle you build, the more fat your body will burn. It may take you longer, though, compared to incorporating cardio exercises.
Weight and resistance training may improve your metabolism over time. Also, lifting weights is typically more effective than cardio at increasing the number of calories you burn after a workout.

HIIT provides similar benefits to cardio and weights in less time
High intensity interval training (HIIT)  involves short bursts of intense exercise alternated with low intensity recovery periods.
You may burn about  485 calories in 45 minutes  of HIIT, including a 5-minute warm-up and a 5-minute cool-down.
The overall caloric burn may vary depending on your weight and exercise intensity. You may need to do a 1-hour vigorous cardio session or more than 1 hour of vigorous weightlifting to burn as many calories.
Typically, a HIIT workout may take about 10–30 minutes.
You can use HIIT with various exercises, including walking, running, biking, jumping rope, or other body weight exercises. You can also incorporate weights, like dumbbells, into your HIIT workout.
All you have to do is increase and decrease the intensity of your movement every few seconds. For example, you could alternate sprinting for 20 seconds and walking for 20 seconds, or you could do squats for 30 seconds and then rest for 20.
One  study  in men compared the calories burned during 30 minutes of HIIT, weight training, running, and biking. The researchers found that HIIT burned 25–30% more calories than the other forms of exercise.
Research from 2017  following more than 400 adults with overweight and  obesity  also found that HIIT and traditional cardio sessions reduced body fat and waist circumference to similar extents.
High intensity interval training (HIIT) helps you burn calories in a short period of time. Some research shows it may burn more calories than weights or cardio, but with less time spent exercising

Using more than one type of exercise may be more effective
Many  exercises help you burn calories  and lose weight, but it also depends on your overall plan. Practicing different types of exercise modalities may help you lose weight, burn fat, and build lean muscle.
Adults need at least  150 minutes of moderate physical activity  per week and 2 days of strength resistance to maintain weight and promote overall health benefits. You could also do 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity and 2 days of strength training.
Physical activity is anything that gets your body moving and your heart pumping. For example, gardening, chores, dancing, walking, swimming, or any exercise session.
All types of exercise and physical activity can help you manage your weight. Alternating exercise methods and physical activity in general will help you achieve your goals.
Your body burns calories just by being alive. Thinking, breathing, and even sleeping require energy. You need to eat enough calories to sustain these body functions. This is called the  basal metabolic rate .
In addition to the essential bodily functions, your body also burns calories by moving. This includes brushing your teeth, standing up and getting a glass of water, and physical activity. The more you move, and the more intense the movement is, the more calories you burn.
Weight training  can lead to an increase in muscle mass and a decrease in fat mass. If your muscle and fat change by the same amount, the numbers on the scale may stay the same, but your body may look and feel different. You may notice a narrower waist, for example. Strength exercises also help your bones stay healthy.
Cardio training  helps improve your heart health, manage blood pressure, and boost your mood. It also helps you  burn fat .
Incorporating weights and cardio — including HIIT — may help you lose weight, burn fat, improve your health, and feel better.
For example, to lose belly fat, you may want to practice HIIT. To tone the abdomen muscles, you may want to weight train.
All types of physical activity help you burn calories. If you burn more calories than you eat, you’re likely to lose weight.

Both diet and exercise are critical for long-term results
Exercise  and a  balanced diet  are essential for good health. Also, all physical activity is more effective at helping you lose weight when accompanied by a dietary plan that involves a  caloric deficit  and the foods that provide the  most nutrients . Consistency is key.
A moderate  reduction in calorie intake  and a physical activity plan are needed for long-term weight loss and maintenance.
Your body weight depends on the balance between how many calories you eat and how many calories you burn.
If you eat as many calories as you burn in a given week, it’s likely you’ll maintain your current weight. If you burn more calories than you eat, you may lose weight, while eating more calories than you burn may lead to weight gain.
Other factors may influence your weight, though. For example, aging and  thyroid health .
What you choose to eat also affects your outcome. Some  foods may help you burn fat  and other  foods may support your overall health and weight loss  journey.
To lose weight, you want to move more in general if possible. Burning more calories from movement is encouraged rather than cutting calories and eating less. This can help you maintain your results long term and keep your body working as best as possible.
Combining a balanced diet and a physical activity plan can help in your long-term weight maintenance success. Weight loss programs that include regular exercise, and not only diet plans, can lead to greater weight loss and better weight maintenance over time.

The takeaway
Both cardio and weightlifting sessions can help you manage your weight and body composition. A cardio workout typically burns more calories than a weight-training session. A HIIT session can help you burn more calories in fewer minutes.
Combining cardio and weights often helps you lose weight, burn fat, and build muscle. Adding a balanced diet also helps you maintain your results and promotes overall health.
Remember to ask a healthcare professional before starting a new exercise program or dietary plan, particularly if you’re not used to either.
