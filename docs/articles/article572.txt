Title: 8 of the Best Vegan Yogurts

Yogurt is a healthy and nutritious food consumed around the world.
Though it’s traditionally made from cow’s milk, vegan versions use nondairy plant sources like almonds, soy, coconuts, peas, oats, or cashews.
Notably, most vegan yogurts include live active cultures, which are probiotics — or beneficial gut bacteria — that support healthy digestion ( 1 ,  2 ).
Yet, vegan yogurts vary in quality and may be loaded with added sugars. Therefore, try to buy them with minimal to no added sugar, relatively few ingredients, and robust nutritional profiles.
Here are 9 of the best vegan yogurts, plus recipes for homemade versions.

A quick look at the best vegan yogurts
Best cashew-based:  Forager Project
Best naturally sweetened:   Oatly Natural Oatgurt
Best with high protein option:   Kite Hill Almond Milk Yogurt
Best unique plant protein:  Lavva Dairy Free Pili Nut Yogurt
Best coconut-based:  So Delicious Coconut Milk Yogurt
Best thick and creamy:  Siggi’s Plant-Based Yogurt
Best almond-based:  Silk Almond Milk Yogurt
Best pea blend:  Chobani
Most of the products below are comparably priced. Still, keep in mind that vegan yogurt tends to be more expensive than dairy yogurt.
Furthermore, you’ll generally pay less for it if you buy larger containers — 24–32 ounces (680–907 grams) — rather than individually packaged yogurts.

How we chose
When examining the best vegan yogurts, here are some factors that were considered:
Protein.  Yogurt should provide some protein in order to offer satiety as a healthy snack. The protein content of the yogurts below ranges, but on average they provide around 5–6 grams of protein per serving.
Sugar content.  Yogurts with a ton of added sugar are more like dessert than a healthy snack. As such, we recommend looking for yogurts that contain minimal to no added sugar to enjoy most of the time.
Probiotics.  Vegan yogurts should contain live active cultures, just like their dairy counterparts.
Key ingredients.  Look for minimal additives and no artificial colors and flavors. Instead, vegan yogurts should primarily be made with a whole plant food or protein, like oats, pea protein, or soy, as the first ingredient.
Vetting.  All the products included have been  vetted  to ensure that they meet Healthline’s medical and business standards.
Price:  $2.49 for 5.3 ounces (150 grams)

Protein  is an important macronutrient that aids numerous bodily processes, such as immunity, cell structure, oxygen transport, and muscle and tissue repair ( 3 ).
Note that the flavored varieties contain 11 grams of added sugar. For a slightly lower sugar but still semi-sweet option, the lightly sweetened variety contains maple syrup and has 7 grams of added sugar ( 4 ).

Homemade vegan yogurt recipes
Although vegan yogurts are increasingly easy to find in the store, you can also make your own using a few simple ingredients. Two recipes are detailed below.
1 can (400 mL) of full fat coconut milk
1–2 vegan probiotic capsules
1–2 tsp. of vanilla extract
Blend  coconut milk  and vanilla until smooth. Open the probiotic capsule(s) and gently mix in. Allow it to thicken in the refrigerator and store for up to 5 days.
2 cups (280 grams) of frozen  blueberries
1/2 cup (60 grams) of raw unsalted cashews
12 ounces (340 grams) of silken tofu
1 tbsp. (15 mL) of lemon juice
1–2 vegan probiotic capsules
Blend all ingredients, except the probiotic capsule(s), until smooth. Then sprinkle in the contents of the capsule(s) and gently stir. Let it thicken in the fridge and keep for up to 5 days.

How to choose the best vegan yogurt
Vegan yogurts can vary significantly in ingredients and quality, making it vital to know what to look for when shopping.
To choose the best vegan yogurt for your needs, keep these tips in mind:
Avoid added sugar.  You can avoid added sugar by choosing unsweetened yogurts. You can add your own sweetener, such as fruit or  maple syrup , if you desire.
Read the labels.  Give the ingredient label a thorough read to ensure that the yogurt doesn’t have any animal products.
Minimal ingredients.  Choose a variety with a minimal number of ingredients. You don’t need much more than a plant milk base, live and active cultures, and natural flavorings or thickening agents.
Look for added nutrients.  Consider nutrient content. For example, if you want an extra boost of  protein  or vitamin B12, check the label for these added nutrients.

Comparing brands

Frequently asked questions
Plant-based yogurt is made with plant-derived ingredients instead of animal-derived ones. For instance, instead of cow’s milk, plant-based yogurts are made using a primary ingredient like soy, peas, oats, cashews, almonds, or coconut.
Yogurt can be a healthy and satisfying snack. However, be sure to read the ingredient and nutrition facts labels to avoid large amounts of added sugar, which can make yogurt more of a dessert than a nutritious snack.
Vegan yogurt contains no animal-derived ingredients at all. Dairy-free yogurt doesn’t contain dairy, but could technically contain other animal-derived ingredients or be manufactured in facilities that handle animal products.
However, most dairy-free yogurts are also vegan.
Vegan yogurts will generally contain similar strains of bacteria as non-vegan yogurts, but vegan yogurts will all be plant-derived instead of dairy-derived.
Common strains used in yogurt are  S. thermophilus  and  L. bulgaricus , but many others that are derived from these two are also used ( 22 ).

The bottom line
Vegan yogurt made from plant-based sources, such as peas, soy, coconut, cashews, and almonds, can be a healthy addition to your diet.
The best ones tend to contain minimal to no  added sugar  and plenty of protein, as well as live and active cultures.
The options in this list are sure to satisfy your cravings for a wholesome, creamy  snack .
