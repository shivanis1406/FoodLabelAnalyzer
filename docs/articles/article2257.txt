Title: 18 Flavorful Salt Alternatives

Salt is one of the most common spices.
While using it in moderation isn’t usually a concern, excess salt intake has been linked to high blood pressure and other health issues ( 1 ).
Many people with chronic health conditions must cut down on salt, and the American population generally eats too much of it ( 1 ).
Instead, you can try several herbs, spices, and other ingredients to add a burst of flavor to your favorite dish.
Here are 18 flavorful salt substitutes.

1. Garlic
Garlic is a pungent spice that boosts flavor without increasing sodium content.
You can cut back on the salt and double the amount of garlic in recipes for tomato sauces and marinades.  Garlic  tastes delicious in soups and stir-fries, too.
What’s more, this allium vegetable is loaded with health benefits. Studies show that garlic compounds may boost immunity, lower blood pressure, and promote  brain health  ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ).

2. Lemon juice or zest
Citrus, especially lemon juice and zest, makes an excellent alternative to salt in some recipes.
As a source of acid, lemon juice acts similarly to salt by bringing out the flavors of a dish. Meanwhile,  lemon zest  contributes an even more potent citrus flavor. The juice and zest of limes and oranges also have these effects.
Citrus  can be drizzled over cooked vegetables and used in salad dressings and marinades for meat and fish.

3. Ground black pepper
Salt and pepper are a classic culinary duo.
Yet, if you’re looking to cut back on salt, simply reach for the pepper shaker instead.  Black pepper  is a good addition to soups, roasts, pastas, and other savory dishes.
Plus, black pepper may  decrease inflammation  that’s linked to chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer ( 5 ).
You can likewise try white pepper, peppercorn mixtures, and pepper alternatives, such as jalapeños, chili peppers, and cayenne peppers.

4. Dill
The fresh taste of  dill , with hints of celery and fennel, makes it a flavorful alternative to salt.
Dill is an especially good substitute in dishes with fish, potatoes, and cucumbers. You can sprinkle it on top of  salmon , use it as the main seasoning in potato salad, or add it to lemon or lime juice for fish dishes.

5. Dried onion or onion powder
Like garlic,  onion  offers a flavor boost to almost any savory recipe.
In particular, dried onion or onion powder is more potent than fresh onion and can be swapped for salt in stir-fries, soups, stews, dips, and  salsas . It offers a bit of spice with a hint of sweetness.

6. Nutritional yeast
Nutritional yeast is a deactivated yeast sold as flakes and powder.
Known for its cheesy, savory flavor, it works well in  popcorn , pastas, and grains. Despite its cheesiness, it doesn’t contain dairy.
Using  nutritional yeast  in place of salt may also have health benefits. The beta glucan fiber in nutritional yeast may help lower your cholesterol, potentially lowering your risk of heart disease ( 6 ).

7. Balsamic vinegar
Balsamic vinegar  has a sharp, tart flavor with a hint of sweetness. It brings out a food’s natural flavors, too, minimizing the need for salt.
Use balsamic vinegar in  salad dressings , soups, stews, and marinades for meat and fish. Reducing it in a saucepan over low heat creates an even more flavorful syrup that you can drizzle over fresh tomatoes or roasted vegetables.

8. Smoked paprika
The smoky, spicy taste of  smoked paprika  is accompanied by a deep red color.
Add it to taco meat, stews, chili, and nachos. You can also use it to replace salsa, which is often high in sodium.
Notably, this spice may have several health benefits. For example, test-tube studies suggest that the paprika compound  capsaicin , which makes some varieties spicy, may stop cancer cell growth ( 7 ).

9. Truffle oil
Truffle oil  is infused with edible fungi for a strong, earthy taste praised by food lovers worldwide.
It’s so potent that you can use just a small amount in place of salt. Drizzle it on pasta,  pizza , eggs, popcorn, mashed potatoes, and vegetables.

10. Rosemary
Rosemary  is a popular herb often used in dipping oils.
Consider adding fresh or dried rosemary to soups, stews, and roasts, as well as roasted vegetables, dressings, sauces, and  breads .

11. Ginger
With its pungent, sweet bite, ginger can replace salt in many dishes.
You can mix freshly chopped ginger root or dried ginger into stir-fries, sauces, marinades,  beverages , and soups.
What’s more, this root has been used for  medicinal purposes  for centuries. It exhibits anti-inflammatory effects and may help improve muscle soreness, among other health benefits ( 8 ,  9 ).

12. Coconut aminos
Coconut aminos , a dark brown liquid made from the nectar of coconut palms, tastes like soy sauce but has a hint of sweetness — and much lower sodium content.
These characteristics make it a great  alternative to soy sauce  in stir-fries, rice dishes, dipping sauces, and marinades.

13. Coriander
Coriander  comes from the seeds of the cilantro plant. It has a warm, floral, lemony taste and is often added ground or whole to salsas, soups, and curries.
Coriander also boasts numerous antioxidants, including terpinene, quercetin, and tocopherols. Test-tube and animal studies have found that these compounds may boost brain health and  immunity  ( 10 ,  11 ).

14. Red pepper flakes
For a spicy kick to any meal, swap salt for  red pepper flakes .
This potent seasoning is made from dried hot peppers. It tastes delicious in soups, chilis, dressings, marinades, pizza, and  pasta .

15. Apple cider vinegar
Sweet and tart, apple cider vinegar makes for a versatile salt replacement.
It can be used as a marinade for pork chops, mixed into salad dressings, and drizzled over  vegetables .
Plus,  apple cider vinegar  may offer health benefits. Animal studies suggest that vinegar lowers cholesterol and improves risk factors for heart disease ( 12 ,  13 ).

16. Cinnamon
Cinnamon, which is one of the most common ingredients in baked goods, can also replace salt.
This warm spice has slightly sweet and peppery undertones. Add it to chilis, soups, tomato sauce, curries, roasts, and marinades for  chicken or turkey .
What’s more, you can swap  cinnamon  for salt when cooking beans or lentils. Add a cinnamon stick to the pot for maximum flavor.

17. Sage
Sage  is a green herb with hints of citrus and eucalyptus.
The flavor of both fresh and dried sage is quite strong, making it a good substitute for salt. It tastes delicious in savory autumn dishes, such as brown butter sauces, roasted  squash , mashed sweet potatoes, and risotto.

18. Tarragon
With its licorice-like, slightly bitter taste,  tarragon  is a flavorful spice.
Instead of going heavy on salt the next time you make scrambled eggs or chicken salad, add fresh or dried tarragon instead. This herb tastes especially delicious in butter or cream sauces that you can serve with chicken,  fish , and veggies.

The bottom line
Salt  is the most common seasoning added to food, but many people consume too much of it.
Healthcare professionals may advise those with high blood pressure or other health conditions to  reduce their salt intake .
Try using one of the flavorful seasonings above as a replacement.
