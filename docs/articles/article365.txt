Title: Ginger Tea in Pregnancy: Benefits, Safety, and Directions

Ginger tea, made by steeping fresh or dried ginger root in hot water, is thought to help relieve nausea and vomiting and may be an effective remedy for morning sickness associated with pregnancy.
Ginger tea is a brew made by seeping ginger root in hot or cold water. It has been used to help relieve nausea, and many people report it helps with their morning sickness during pregnancy.
This article examines if it’s safe to drink ginger during pregnancy, if it relieves pregnancy-induced nausea, how to make it, and more.

Possible benefits of ginger tea in pregnancy
Researchers report that  around 70%  of women experience nausea and vomiting, also known as  morning sickness , during pregnancy. Since it’s such a common experience, there are many home remedies people try to find relief.
One such remedy is ginger “tea.” Made by boiling or seeping ginger root, this beverage is a common one, and many people report that it helps.
Ginger root contains a variety of plant compounds that may help with some of the discomforts of pregnancy. Specifically, two types of compounds in ginger —  gingerols and shogaols  — are thought to act on receptors in the digestive system and speed stomach emptying, which in turn may help reduce feelings of nausea.
Gingerols are present in large amounts in raw ginger, while shogaols are more abundant in dried ginger. This means that ginger tea made from either fresh or dried ginger may contain compounds with  anti-nausea effects  and be suitable for treating nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.

Effectiveness of ginger tea for morning sickness
Most studies analyzing ginger’s ability to relieve morning sickness have used ginger capsules. However, their results still highlight the possible benefits of ginger tea, as 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of grated  ginger root  steeped in water can provide the  same amount  of ginger as a 1,000-mg supplement.
One  2016 review of studies  of ginger to treat nausea and vomiting is most often cited. Those researchers found that ginger capsules were:
more effective than a placebo
as effective or more than vitamin B6
as effective as the motion sickness medication dimenhydrinate (Dramamine)
less effective than the antinausea medication metoclopramide (Reglan)
These collective results suggest that ginger tea may help women with morning sickness, especially during the first trimester.

Recommended amounts and possible side effects
Ginger tea is generally considered  safe during pregnancy , at least in reasonable amounts.
While there is no standardized dose  for nausea relief  in pregnancy, research suggests that up to 1 gram (1,000 mg) of ginger per day is safe. This  equates to  4 cups (950 ml) of packaged ginger tea, or homemade ginger tea made from 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of grated ginger root steeped in water.
Research  has found no associations between taking ginger during pregnancy and an increased risk of preterm birth, stillbirth, low birth weight, or other complications. However, some evidence suggests that ginger tea should not be consumed close to labor, as ginger may increase the risk of bleeding and may be associated with preterm labor.
Finally, frequently drinking large amounts of ginger tea may lead to  unpleasant side effects  in some individuals. These include heartburn, gas, and belching.
If you experience these symptoms while drinking ginger tea, you may want to cut back on the amount you drink.

How to make ginger tea
You can use dried or fresh ginger to make  ginger tea  at home.
After steeping 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of sliced or grated raw ginger root in hot water, take a sip of the tea to determine whether the strength of the ginger flavor suits your preference. Simply add water to dilute the tea if you find it too strong.
Alternatively, you can pour hot water over a dried ginger teabag and let it sit for a few minutes before drinking.
Be sure to sip ginger tea slowly so that you don’t consume it too quickly and feel more nauseous.

The bottom line
Ginger has been shown to reduce nausea and vomiting during pregnancy for some people.
Drinking ginger tea may help relieve morning sickness during pregnancy. It’s generally considered safe to drink up to 4 cups (950 ml) of ginger tea per day while pregnant. However, ginger tea should not be consumed after 37 weeks gestation, as it may  increase the risk  of preterm labor.
