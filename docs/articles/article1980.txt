Title: 17 Foods to Lower Your Blood Sugar

Several foods may help lower your blood sugar, but some may be more effective than others.
Although factors such as body weight, activity, stress, and genetics also play a role in regulating blood sugar, following a healthy diet is critical for blood sugar management ( 1 ,  2 ).
While some foods, including those high in added sugar and refined carbs, can contribute to blood sugar fluctuations, others can optimize blood sugar regulation while promoting overall health ( 3 ,  4 ).
Here are 17 foods that may help regulate your blood sugar.

1. Broccoli and broccoli sprouts
Sulforaphane is a type of isothiocyanate that has blood sugar-reducing properties. This plant chemical is produced through an enzyme reaction when broccoli is chopped or chewed ( 5 ).
Test-tube, animal, and a few human studies have shown that sulforaphane-rich broccoli extract has potent antidiabetic effects, helping  enhance insulin sensitivity  and reduce blood sugar and oxidative stress markers ( 6 ,  7 ).
Broccoli sprouts are concentrated sources of glucosinolates such as glucoraphanin. Research suggests that these compounds help promote insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes when supplemented as a powder or extract ( 8 ,  9 ).
Additionally, eating cruciferous vegetables may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, but more research is needed ( 10 ,  11 ).
The best way to enhance the availability of sulforaphane is to enjoy broccoli and sprouts raw or lightly steamed or add active sources of myrosinase, such as mustard seed powder, to cooked broccoli ( 12 ).

2. Seafood
Seafood, including fish and  shellfish , is a valuable source of protein, healthy fats, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that may help regulate blood sugar levels.
Protein is essential for blood sugar management. It helps slow digestion, prevents postmeal blood sugar spikes, and increases feelings of fullness. Plus, it may help prevent overeating and promote excess body fat loss, two essential effects for healthy blood sugar levels ( 13 ).
A high intake of fatty fish such as  salmon  and sardines has been shown to help improve blood sugar regulation.
For example, in a small study with 68 participants, adults with overweight or obesity who consumed 26 ounces (oz), or 750 grams (g), of fatty fish per week had significant improvements in postmeal blood sugar levels compared with those who consumed lean fish ( 14 ).

3. Pumpkin and pumpkin seeds
Brightly colored and packed with fiber and antioxidants,  pumpkin  is a great choice for blood sugar regulation. Pumpkin is a traditional diabetes remedy in many countries, including Mexico and Iran ( 15 ).
Pumpkin is high in carbs called polysaccharides, which have been studied for their blood sugar-regulating potential. Treatments with pumpkin extracts and powders have been shown to significantly decrease blood sugar levels in both limited human studies and animal studies ( 16 ,  17 ).
However, more research is needed to determine how whole pumpkins may benefit blood sugar.
Pumpkin seeds  are packed with healthy fats and protein, which make them an excellent choice for blood sugar management ( 18 ,  19 ).
A small 2018 study with 40 participants found that consuming 2 oz (65 g) of pumpkin seeds reduced postmeal blood sugar by up to 35% compared with a control group ( 20 ).

4. Nuts and nut butter
Research has shown that  eating nuts  may be an effective way to help regulate blood sugar levels.
In a small study of 25 people with type 2 diabetes, consuming both peanuts and almonds throughout the day as part of a low carb diet reduced fasting and postmeal blood sugar levels ( 21 ).
Also, a review found that consuming various types of tree nuts led to reduced fasting blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. However, the authors noted that the results were not clinically significant and that more research is necessary ( 22 ).

5. Okra
Okra is a fruit that’s commonly used like a vegetable. It’s a rich source of blood sugar-lowering compounds such as polysaccharides and flavonoid antioxidants ( 23 ).
Okra seeds may be beneficial as a natural remedy for diabetes due to their potent blood sugar-lowering properties ( 24 ).
Rhamnogalacturonan, the main polysaccharide in okra, has been identified as a powerful antidiabetic compound. Plus, okra contains the flavonoids isoquercitrin and quercetin 3-O-gentiobioside, which help reduce blood sugar by inhibiting certain enzymes ( 25 ,  26 ,  27 ).
Although animal studies suggest that  okra  has potent antidiabetic properties, human research studies are needed.

6. Flaxseed
Flaxseed  is rich in fiber and healthy fats and may help reduce blood sugar levels.
In an 8-week study of 57 people with type 2 diabetes, those who consumed 7 oz (200 g) of 2.5% fat yogurt containing 1 oz (30 g) of flaxseed each day experienced significant reductions in HbA1c — a marker of long-term blood sugar regulation — compared with those who consumed plain yogurt ( 28 ).
Moreover, a review of 25 controlled studies found that eating whole flaxseed led to significant improvements in blood sugar regulation ( 29 ).

7. Beans and lentils
Beans and  lentils  are rich in magnesium, fiber, and protein. These nutrients may be able to help lower blood sugar. They’re particularly high in soluble fiber and resistant starch, which help slow digestion and may improve blood sugar response after meals ( 30 ).
For example, a study of 12 women demonstrated that adding black beans or chickpeas to a rice meal significantly reduced postmeal blood sugar levels compared with eating rice alone ( 30 ).
Many other studies have shown that eating beans and lentils can benefit blood sugar regulation and possibly help protect against the development of diabetes ( 31 ,  32 ).

8. Kimchi and sauerkraut
Fermented foods such as kimchi and  sauerkraut  contain health-promoting compounds, including probiotics, minerals, and antioxidants. Research associates these compounds with improved blood sugar and insulin sensitivity ( 33 ,  34 ).
A 2021 review concluded that probiotic foods had a notable effect on blood sugar regulation in people with type 2 diabetes. Researchers noted that these foods had the greatest impact on people whose diabetes was not well managed and those who were not on insulin therapy ( 35 ).
However, most studies into the effect of fermented foods on blood sugar regulation involve rodent or cellular investigations. As a result, further controlled human studies are necessary ( 36 ).

9. Chia seeds
Eating  chia seeds  may benefit blood sugar regulation. Some studies link chia seed consumption to reductions in blood sugar levels and improvements in insulin sensitivity.
A 2020 review of 17 animal studies concluded that chia seeds might help improve insulin sensitivity and blood sugar regulation and potentially reduce disease risk, including the risk of diabetes ( 37 ).
Also, a study of 15 healthy adults showed that participants who received 1 oz (25 g) of ground chia seeds alongside 2 oz (50 g) of a sugar solution had a 39% reduction in blood sugar levels compared with those who consumed the sugar solution alone ( 38 ,  39 ).

10. Kale
People often describe kale as a “ superfood ” — and for a good reason. It contains multiple compounds that may help decrease blood sugar levels, including fiber and flavonoid antioxidants.
A study that included 42 Japanese adults demonstrated that consuming either 7 or 14 g of kale-containing foods with a high carb meal significantly decreased postmeal blood sugar levels compared with placebo ( 40 ).
Research has shown that the flavonoid antioxidants found in  kale , including quercetin and kaempferol, have potent blood sugar-lowering and insulin-sensitizing effects ( 41 ).

11. Berries
Numerous studies link berry intake with improved blood sugar regulation.  Berries  contain fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and all of this makes them an excellent choice for people with blood sugar management issues.
A 2019 study found that eating 2 cups (250 g) of red raspberries with a high carb meal significantly reduced postmeal insulin and blood sugar in adults with prediabetes compared with a control group ( 42 ).
In addition to raspberries, studies have shown that strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries may benefit blood sugar management by enhancing insulin sensitivity and improving glucose clearance from the blood ( 43 ,  44 ,  45 ).

12. Avocados
Avocados  may offer significant benefits for blood sugar regulation. They’re rich in healthy fats, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and adding them to meals may improve blood sugar management.
Numerous studies have found that avocados may help reduce blood sugar levels and protect against the development of metabolic syndrome through fat loss. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions, including high blood pressure and high blood sugar, that increases chronic disease risk ( 46 ,  47 ,  48 ).
However, remember that many studies investigating the effects of avocado intake on blood sugar levels were funded by the Hass Avocado Board, which could have influenced aspects of the studies ( 46 ,  48 ).

13. Oats and oat bran
Including oats and  oat bran  in your diet may help improve your blood sugar levels due to their high soluble fiber content, which has been shown to have significant blood sugar-reducing properties ( 49 ).
An analysis of 16 studies found that oat intake significantly reduced HbA1c and fasting blood sugar levels compared with control meals ( 50 ).
Moreover, a small study of 10 people found that drinking 7 oz of water mixed with 1 oz of oat bran before eating white bread significantly reduced postmeal blood sugar compared with drinking plain water ( 51 ).

14. Citrus fruits
Although citrus fruits contain natural sugar, they are considered low to medium on the  glycemic index . Citrus fruits are also good sources of vitamins, minerals, and fiber ( 52 ).
Citrus fruits such as oranges and grapefruit are packed with fiber and contain plant compounds such as naringenin, a polyphenol with powerful antidiabetic properties ( 53 ).
Eating whole  citrus fruits  may help improve insulin sensitivity, reduce HbA1c, and protect against diabetes ( 54 ,  55 ,  56 ,  57 ).

15. Kefir and yogurt
Kefir and  yogurt  are fermented dairy products that may help regulate blood sugar.
An 8-week study of 60 people with type 2 diabetes showed that drinking 20 oz (600 milliliters) of  kefir , a probiotic-rich yogurt drink, per day significantly reduced fasting blood sugar and HbA1c compared with drinking kefir that did not contain probiotics ( 58 ).
Yogurt consumption may also lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. In a 2022 analysis of 42 studies, the authors concluded that each 50 g (1.7 oz) of daily yogurt intake was associated with a 7% decrease in type 2 diabetes risk ( 59 ).

16. Eggs
Eggs are a concentrated source of protein, healthy fats, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Some studies have linked egg consumption to better blood sugar regulation.
A study of 42 adults with overweight or obesity and either prediabetes or type 2 diabetes showed that eating one large  egg  per day led to a significant 4.4% reduction in fasting blood sugar and improvements in insulin sensitivity compared with an egg substitute ( 60 ).
What’s more, during a 14-year follow-up study of 7,002 Korean adults, frequent egg intake of two to less than four servings per week was associated with a 40% lower risk of diabetes than eating eggs once per week or less. This association was apparent in men but not in women ( 61 ).

17. Apples
Apples  contain soluble fiber and plant compounds, including quercetin, chlorogenic acid, and gallic acid, which may help reduce blood sugar and protect against diabetes ( 62 ,  63 ).
A study of 18 women found that eating apples 30 minutes before a rice meal significantly reduced postmeal blood sugar compared with eating rice alone ( 64 ).
