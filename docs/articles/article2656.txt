Title: 10 Tasty Keto Options at Jamba Juice

Jamba Juice is widely considered a healthy place to eat, offering a variety of juices, smoothie bowls, and smoothies that highlight fresh fruits and vegetables.
Still, eating keto at Jamba Juice can be difficult, as most of its offerings are high in carbs. On the low carb, high fat  keto diet , most people aim to eat fewer than 50 grams of total carbs or 25 grams of net carbs — which are total carbs minus fiber and sugar alcohols — per day.
Although Jamba Juice is known for its smoothies, smoothie bowls, and freshly squeezed juices, the best keto options at Jamba Juice are wellness shots or breakfast sandwiches and flatbreads without the bread.
Here are 10 tasty keto options at Jamba Juice.

1–6. Shots
These wellness shots are flavorful and nutrient-packed alternatives to carb-rich smoothies. Given that they only contain a few sips each, all of the wellness shots offered by Jamba Juice can be part of your keto diet.
That said, you may not want to spend any of your daily carb allotment on these wellness shots, as they don’t provide any fat or protein, so they aren’t a good replacement for a full meal or snack.
This  ginger  shot is flavored with orange juice, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper, and it features a hefty dose of ginger juice, which may offer anti-inflammatory and nausea-soothing benefits ( 1 ).

7–10. Bites
Bites refer to Jamba Juice’s menu offerings that include sandwiches, wraps, and flatbreads.
Ordering these items without the bread will probably be the best option for most keto dieters, as they’ll offer some protein and fat alongside a relatively low carb count.
However, the nutrition information for these breads alone is not available on the Jamba Juice website, and you can’t customize your order to remove the bread when ordering online.
If you’re not able to do so in the store either, simply discard the bread and other higher carb ingredients once you receive your order.
For the items below, the nutrition information provided is for the menu item with bread. However, removing the bread and other higher carb ingredients should remove almost all of the total and  net carbs , as well as a significant chunk of calories.
Note that specific carb counts for these items without bread aren’t available.
This lean and protein-packed sandwich contains a veggie and egg white patty with a cheese spread,  feta cheese , bacon, and roasted tomatoes. To minimize the carbs, order without bread and tomatoes. Leaving a slice or two of tomato will add a minimal amount of carbs.
Alternatively, Jamba Juice offers a Roasted Tomato, Spinach, and Feta Breakfast Sandwich, which is identical to this option but doesn’t have any bacon.
Order:   Bacon Roasted Tomato, Spinach, and Feta Breakfast Sandwich, no tomatoes or bread
With bread and tomatoes, it contains:
Calories:  250
Fat:  9 grams
Protein:  12 grams
Total carbs:  30 grams
Fiber:  4 grams
Net carbs:  26 grams
This savory breakfast wrap contains spinach and mozzarella cheese, along with scrambled  egg whites , an asiago cheese spread, and caramelized onions in a whole wheat tortilla. Remove the tortilla and onions to minimize the carbs.
Order:   Spinach ‘N Cheese Breakfast Wrap, no tortilla or onions
With tortilla and onions, it contains:
Calories:  240
Fat:  7 grams
Protein:  15 grams
Total carbs:  30 grams
Fiber:  3 grams
Net carbs:  27 grams
This flatbread is Jamba Juice’s take on a  cheese  pizza, featuring a four-cheese blend and pizza sauce on its signature flatbread. Order without the flatbread for the equivalent of a crustless pizza.
Order:   Four-Cheese Flatbread, no bread
It’s unclear whether the flatbreads are preassembled or made at the store, so you may be unable to order one with no bread. In that case, simply discard the bread once you receive your order.
With bread, it contains:
Calories:  350
Fat:  11 grams
Protein:  18 grams
Total carbs:  44 grams
Fiber:  1 gram
Net carbs:  43 grams
This flatbread contains grilled  chicken , three types of cheese, roasted bell peppers and poblano chilies, and Jamaican jerk seasoning. Without the bread, it should be a keto-friendly option.
Order:   Spicy ‘N Sweet Chicken Flatbread, no bread
If you’re unable to order this item without bread, simply discard it once you receive your order.
With bread, it contains:
Calories:  330
Fat:  11 grams
Protein:  12 grams
Total carbs:  38 grams
Fiber:  4 grams
Net carbs:  34 grams

A note about smoothies, bowls, and juices
Smoothies , smoothie bowls, and fresh juices are Jamba Juice’s claim to fame. However, all of these products pack at least 31 grams of total carbs per serving, with some smoothies and smoothie bowls containing over 100 grams of total carbs per serving.
Even after customizing, it’s impossible to get many of these products down to a reasonable carb count for a keto diet — even if you choose a small or child’s size. For reference, here are the  lowest carb  items you can order from these sections of the menu:
Smoothie:  kids’ Strawberries Gone Bananas, 36 grams of total carbs and 33 grams of net carbs
Bowl:  plain oatmeal (no toppings), 31 grams of total and net carbs
Juice:  small Great Greens, 34 grams of total carbs and 30 grams of net carbs
Because these menu options are so high in carbs, it’s best to stick with wellness shots or bites if you’re eating keto.

Ordering tips
Eating keto at Jamba Juice can be tricky, as most of the offerings are extremely high in carbs.
If ordering something that’s not on this list, here are some tips to help you  make it as low in carbs as possible :
Order a small or child’s size, if available.
Skip high carb toppings or additions, such as bananas, honey, brown sugar, and granola.
Keep in mind that child-sized menu items likely won’t contain the calories needed for a complete meal for an adult.
Additionally, you’ll need to carefully plan out the rest of your day to remain within your daily carb limit.

The bottom line
Jamba Juice offers a variety of nutrient-rich, produce-filled options, but most of their smoothies, bowls, and juices are loaded with carbs.
If you’re on  keto , your best bet at Jamba Juice is to stick with wellness shots or sandwiches and flatbreads without the bread.
Regardless, the exact nutrient content of the sandwiches without bread is unknown, as the information for the bread is unavailable on the Jamba Juice website.
If you choose to order a higher carb item, you can minimize its carb count by choosing a small or child’s size and opting out of high carb additions like bananas or brown sugar.
Eating keto at Jamba Juice is tricky, but it can be done with some careful planning.
