Title: 19 Foods That Can Fight Sugar Cravings

Certain foods and beverages, such as fruit, yogurt, sweet potatoes, and smoothies, may help reduce sugar cravings. Foods that contain whole grains, fiber, and protein may also keep you feeling fuller longer.
Sugar cravings are when you experience a strong urge to eat something sweet and find it difficult to control yourself.
This may  lead to  eating too many calories and unintentional weight gain, sometimes on a regular basis.
Luckily, there are things you can do to take the edge off.
Here are 19 foods that can help you fight your sugar cravings.

Foods to eat
A wide range of foods and beverages could help you fight your sugar cravings.

1. Fruit
When most people feel sugar cravings, they  reach for  high calorie foods like chocolate.
However, swapping out junk food for fruit when you’re craving sugar may give you the sweet hit you need and  stop your craving  in its tracks.
Fruit  is naturally sweet but also contains beneficial plant compounds like fiber. These are  associated with  several health benefits, such as:
lower risk of chronic health conditions, such as  type 2 diabetes ,  cardiovascular disease , and  cancer
more sustainable long-term  weight management
increased mental well-being, healthy aging, and bone health
To make sure it hits the spot, eat fruits slightly higher in sugar, such as  mangoes  or  grapes . You can also add fruit to yogurt to make it a more satisfying snack.

2. Berries
Berries  are a nutritious choice to help stop sugar cravings.
They taste sweet, but their high  fiber  content means they’re lower in sugar and could  help  keep you full longer.
This could make berries a great choice if your sugar cravings are linked to habit, rather than hunger. For example, you might crave sweet foods while watching TV.
Additionally, berries have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that could help  reduce  risk factors for chronic diseases like heart disease,  cognitive decline , and  diabetes .

3. Dark chocolate
Chocolate is one of the  most commonly  reported foods people eat when they crave sweets.
If you’re craving chocolate, you can make a healthier choice by choosing dark chocolate.
Dark chocolate  contains healthy plant compounds known as polyphenols. Their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects may  help improve  various markers of cognitive and heart health.
What’s more, dark chocolate has nearly  five times  more polyphenols than milk and white chocolate, while containing significantly less sugar.
However, dark chocolate does still contain sugar and fat, so it’s best to limit yourself to  one serving or less  per day.

4. Snack bars
Not all snack bars are healthy, and some are very high in fat and sugar.
However, if you’re craving a sweet treat, some low sugar options are available. Look for a snack bar made with whole foods, whole oats, and fresh or dried fruit rather than table sugar.
Watch out for bars that contain a lot of so-called “healthy” sugar, such as honey, agave syrup, or coconut sugar. These are still  added sugars , which  aren’t good  for you in large amounts.
Alternatively, you could try  making your own healthy snack bars .

5. Chia seeds
Chia seeds  are a  good source  of many important nutrients, including  omega-3 fatty acids , soluble fiber, and plant compounds.
Soluble fiber  readily absorbs water and swells up to form a jelly-like substance in your gut, which may help keep you  feeling fuller  for longer and prevent sugar cravings.
Chia seeds are also versatile, so if you want a dessert to satisfy your sweet craving, you could try making a chia pudding like  this one .

6. Sugar-free chewing gum or mints
Chewing gum  can be a great way to control your sugar cravings.
Gum or mints made with  artificial sweeteners  taste sweet but contain a minimal number of calories and no sugar.
Although results are mixed, some  studies  suggest that chewing gum could help control hunger, cravings, and the intake of carb-heavy foods later in the day.
Chewing gum is also good for your teeth, as it could  help reduce  the risk of  cavities .

7. Lentils
Lentils  are great plant-based sources of fiber and protein.
In fact, 1 cup (198 grams (g)) of boiled lentils provides  18 g  of protein and 15.5 g of fiber.
These nutrients may increase feelings of fullness, which could help reduce hunger-driven sugar cravings throughout the day.
Research  also suggests lentils could help you manage weight, blood sugar levels, and gut health.

8. Yogurt
Yogurt  is a snack high in protein and rich in calcium, which may  help reduce  your appetite and blood sugar levels.
Similarly, a  2015 review  suggests yogurt may be a good snack to help regulate your appetite throughout the day and control your sugar cravings.
Be sure to choose yogurt that contains live cultures and is free of added sugar.

9. Dates
Dates  are the dried fruit of the date palm tree. Although they contain nearly  70%  sugar, they’re highly nutritious and may help reduce sugar cravings.
A  2020 study  in people with diabetes found that eating three dates daily for 16 weeks had no effect on blood sugar levels. However, it helped decrease  LDL (bad)  and  total  cholesterol levels, while significantly improving quality of life.
Try pairing dates with nuts like  almonds  for a sweet and crunchy treat.
However, remember that dates are very sweet, so stick to one portion at a time, or about three dates.

10. Sweet potatoes
Sweet potatoes  are nutritious, sweet, and filling. They  contain  mostly carbs but also fiber and a number of vitamins and minerals, including  vitamin A ,  vitamin C , and  potassium .
You may get sugar cravings because you’re not eating enough throughout the day.
Including a carb source like sweet potatoes in your meals may help combat this by adding calories to your meals and making them more balanced.
As their name implies, sweet potatoes can also provide the sweet taste you’re craving.
For a delicious treat, try roasting them with cinnamon and paprika.

11. Meat, poultry, and fish
Including a source of protein like  meat ,  poultry , or  fish  in your meals may  help prevent  sugar cravings.
If you’re trying to  lose weight , eating adequate  amounts of protein  is important for  managing  your hunger, food intake, cravings, and weight.
If you’re vegetarian, don’t worry —  plant-based protein sources  may have the  same effect .

12. Smoothies
Smoothies can be a great option if you’re craving a sugar-sweetened beverage.
Try combining different types of fruit with yogurt. The sweetness of the fruit combined with the filling effects of yogurt can satisfy your craving while providing various nutrients.
If you’re having a smoothie, make sure to use the whole fruit, not just the juice, so you can retain the healthy fiber.

13. Sugar-free soda
Soda  is extremely sweet, and drinking high amounts of sugar-sweetened beverages has been linked to several chronic health conditions,  such as :
heart disease
diabetes
obesity
hypertension
insulin resistance
However, going cold turkey and cutting them out completely can be difficult.
Switching to a  sugar-free version  can help you get a sweet fix without the added sugar and calories.

14. Prunes
Prunes  are dried plums.
Like dates, they’re  full of fiber  and nutrients and taste very sweet.
As such, you can reach for them as a healthy alternative to candy when you’re craving sugar.
Their high fiber content and naturally-occurring sorbitol may also help relieve constipation.  Sorbitol  is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol that tastes sweet but is absorbed slowly in your gut.

15. Eggs
Eggs  are a high protein food that may help keep your appetite and cravings in check.
In fact, research has shown that having a  high protein breakfast  like eggs  may reduce  hunger and help people eat less throughout the day.
This may be partly because a high protein meal  suppresses  the hunger hormone  ghrelin  and increases some of the hormones that make you feel full, including peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).
This suggests an egg breakfast could keep you feeling fuller for longer and keep the cravings at bay.

16. Trail mix
Trail mix  is the name often given to a snack containing  dried fruit  and nuts.
The exact combination of ingredients can vary, but trail mix can make a great choice if you’re craving something sweet.
The sweetness of the dried fruit can help halt your sugar cravings, and it’s also a great way to get some nuts into your diet.
Nuts  contain healthy fats, proteins, fiber, and plant compounds linked to a number of  health benefits , including  improved  risk factors for heart disease.
Trail mix can be very high in calories, so stick to a serving of around one handful.

17. Fermented foods
Fermented foods  like  kimchi ,  kombucha , and  sauerkraut  are sources of beneficial bacteria.
The beneficial bacteria found in these foods may  help maintain  the balance of “good” bacteria in your gut and reduce the number of disease-causing bacteria.
In fact, the bacteria in your gut are also linked to many of your  body’s processes  and can “talk” to your brain through the compounds and hormones they produce.
This allows your gut bacteria to  influence  your food intake. Some of these compounds may even mimic hunger or fullness hormones in your body, influencing your appetite and food cravings.
Because of this, it’s been suggested that including fermented food in your diet could contribute to  maintaining a healthy gut  and preventing food cravings.

18. Whole grains
Whole grains  are high in fiber and contain several beneficial nutrients,  such as :
B vitamins
magnesium
iron
phosphorus
manganese
selenium
Compared to eating  refined carbohydrates , eating whole grains  may help  increase fullness and reduce your desire to eat more often.
Whole grains can also  promote  the growth of beneficial bacteria in your gut, such as  Bifidobacteria  and  Lactobacilli . These could help improve your level of fullness, although more research is needed in this area.

19. Vegetables
While eating vegetables may not be satisfying when you’re experiencing an acute sugar craving, including them in your diet regularly could be helpful.
Vegetables  are high in fiber and low in calories. They  also contain  lots of beneficial nutrients and plant compounds.
Eating more vegetables is probably one of the best things you can do for your health and could  lower  your risk of diseases like heart disease and cancer.
Adding vegetables is also a great way to bulk up your meals, helping you feel more satisfied throughout the day.

Frequently asked questions
Eating something sweet and high in fiber could help you satisfy your sugar craving. Healthy foods may include sweet potatoes, chia seeds, berries, prunes, dates, and lean proteins.
Some people claim nutrient deficiencies may lead to sugar cravings. However, a  2020 review  suggests nutrient deficiencies play a very small role in cravings. Instead, external cues associated with certain foods, such as certain hobbies, time of day, or place, may have more impact.

Takeaway
Having the odd sweet treat is fine for most people, so you shouldn’t feel guilty if you occasionally indulge.
However, if you regularly experience sugar cravings or feel out of control around sweet foods, it’s worth taking a closer look at your diet.
If you need something sweet, try swapping a sugar-filled treat with a healthier option on this list.
