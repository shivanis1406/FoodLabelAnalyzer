Title: 10 Best Vitamin E Supplements, According to Dietitians

Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays several roles in your body, including serving as an antioxidant and boosting heart and eye health. It may also promote healthy skin, especially when applied topically ( 1 ).
It’s found naturally in nuts, seeds, vegetable oils, fruits, and vegetables ( 2 ).
Most people don’t need to supplement orally with vitamin E unless a healthcare professional has directed them to do so.
Some examples of people who may need vitamin E supplements are those with conditions that cause fat malabsorption, such as Crohn’s disease and cystic fibrosis ( 3 ,  4 ).
However, if you do need to take a vitamin E supplement, there are some great options.
Here are the 10 best vitamin E supplements.

What do vitamin E supplements help with?
Vitamin E supplements can help prevent deficiency, which may be particularly important for those who have chronic conditions that affect the digestion and absorption of fat ( 3 ,  4 ).
Vitamin E supplements may also offer other health benefits, including ( 2 ):
Heart health:  Some research suggests that the antioxidant effects of vitamin E could help protect against some risk factors for heart disease. However, other studies have turned up conflicting findings on the effects of supplementation ( 5 ).
Eye health:  Vitamin E is involved in the development of certain conditions that affect vision, such as macular degeneration. More research is needed to find out whether supplementation may be beneficial ( 6 ).
Cancer prevention:  Some test-tube studies suggest that vitamin E may also help slow the growth and spread of cancer cells, thanks to its antioxidant properties. However, studies in humans are limited ( 7 ).
Brain function:  According to one review of 22 studies, vitamin E may help preserve brain function and could therefore help slow cognitive decline. Still, additional research is needed, as studies have turned up mixed results ( 8 ).

A comparison of the best vitamin E supplements
Here’s a quick look at how our top picks compare:

How to choose a vitamin E supplement
When choosing a vitamin E supplement, there are several factors to consider, including third-party testing, ingredients, form of vitamin E, and dosage.
Because the FDA doesn’t regulate supplements in the same way it regulates drugs, third-party testing ensures that the supplement label accurately reflects what’s in the bottle.
Choosing a product that is certified by a third-party organization like USP or NSF International can also help ensure quality and purity.
It’s important to select a vitamin E supplement made with high quality ingredients and few fillers.
Ideally, it will be made with an oil, because this helps boost your body’s absorption of  fat-soluble vitamins  ( 13 ).
Additionally, if you prefer to take naturally sourced vitamin E, you should avoid supplements that contain the synthetic form, dl-alpha-tocopherol.
Vitamin E supplements are available in a variety of forms, including capsules, softgels, and chewable tablets.
Although some liquid vitamin E oils are available and can be taken orally, most are formulated to be applied directly to your skin.
Additionally, it seems that few or no liquid vitamin E supplements have undergone third-party testing.
The DV for vitamin E is 15 mg for adults and children ages 4 years and older ( 2 ).
Some supplements may list the amount of vitamin E in international units (IU). The DV for vitamin E in IU is 22.4 IU of natural vitamin E or 33.3 IU of synthetic vitamin E.
Meanwhile, the Tolerable Upper Intake Level — the maximum amount you can safely take without any side effects — is 1,000 mg per day for adults ( 2 ).
If you take too much vitamin E, it can build up in your fat stores over time and cause  serious complications  such as excessive bleeding, so it’s best to consult a healthcare professional before using high dose supplements ( 2 ).

Who should take vitamin E supplements?
Most people don’t need a vitamin E supplement and can easily meet their needs by following a healthy, well-rounded diet.
However, supplementation may be recommended for some people, including those with certain health conditions that can impair the digestion or absorption of fat.
This includes medical conditions such as ( 4 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 ):
Cystic fibrosis:  a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive tract
Crohn’s disease:  a chronic condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract
Abetalipoproteinemia:  a rare genetic disorder that affects fat absorption
Ataxia and vitamin E deficiency (AVED):  an inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by involuntary muscle movements
Cholestasis:  a disorder that causes reduced bile flow from the liver, which can impair fat absorption
Celiac disease:  an autoimmune disorder triggered by the consumption of gluten
While taking supplements containing 540 mg or less of vitamin E per day is unlikely to cause any  negative side effects , it’s best to consult a healthcare professional before adding a vitamin E supplement to your routine ( 17 ).

Potential symptoms of a vitamin E deficiency
Though  vitamin E deficiency  is rare, it sometimes occurs in people with chronic conditions that impact the absorption of fat.
Some of the possible symptoms associated with vitamin E deficiency are ( 14 ):
vision problems
loss of sensation in the arms or legs
decreased immune function
muscle weakness
loss of control over body movements
However, keep in mind that these symptoms are associated with a severe deficiency.
In fact, though the average American diet provides less than the recommended daily amount of vitamin E, most people are unlikely to experience any symptoms of deficiency ( 14 ).

Frequently asked questions
Ideally, look for vitamin E supplements that contain alpha-tocopherol, which is the biologically active form of vitamin E that is most well-absorbed by the body ( 18 ).
Those who prefer naturally sourced vitamin E may want to opt for supplements made with d-alpha tocopherol. Products that contain dl-alpha tocopherol are derived from synthetic vitamin E but are often more affordable.
While most people can meet their vitamin E needs by following a balanced and nutritious diet, taking 540 mg or less per day is unlikely to cause any side effects ( 17 ).
Taking amounts higher than this each day is not recommended unless advised by a healthcare professional.
Vitamin E supplements are helpful for promoting the health of the  skin , heart, and eyes ( 2 ).
They can be especially useful for people who have difficulty meeting their vitamin E needs through diet alone, including people with health conditions that affect fat absorption ( 2 ).
Nordic Naturals Vitamin E Complex is Healthline’s choice as the best overall vitamin E supplement as it contains highly absorbable forms of vitamin E, is third-party tested, includes extra-virgin olive oil to enhance absorption.

The bottom line
Vitamin E supplements generally aren’t necessary unless a healthcare professional has instructed you to take them.
It’s best to choose vitamin E supplements that are third-party tested, contain minimal fillers and additives, and provide at least 100% of the DV per serving.
