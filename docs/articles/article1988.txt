Title: A Guide on What to Eat During Pregnancy

While you’re pregnant, you’ll want to eat extra protein, calcium, iron, and essential vitamins. You can get these by eating a wide variety of lean meat, seafood, whole grains, and plant-based foods.
When building your  healthy eating plan , you’ll want to focus on whole foods that give you higher amounts of the  good stuff  you’d need when not pregnant, such as:
protein
vitamins and minerals
healthy types of fat
complex carbohydrates
fiber and fluids
Here are 13 nutritious foods to eat when you’re pregnant to help make sure you’re  eating healthily .

1. Dairy products
During pregnancy, you’ll need extra protein and calcium to meet your baby’s needs. Dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt are good choices.
Dairy products contain two types of high-quality protein: casein and whey. Dairy is the  best dietary source  of calcium. It also provides phosphorus, B vitamins, magnesium, and zinc.
Yogurt, especially Greek yogurt, may be especially beneficial. Some varieties also contain  probiotic bacteria , which support digestive health.
If you’re lactose intolerant, you may also be able to  tolerate yogurt , especially probiotic yogurt. Check with your doctor to see if you can test it out. A whole world of yogurt smoothies, parfaits, and lassi could be waiting.

2. Legumes
These include lentils, peas, beans,  chickpeas , soybeans, and peanuts.
Legumes  are great plant-based sources of fiber, protein, iron, folate, and calcium — all of which your body needs more of during pregnancy.
Folate is one of the most essential B vitamins (B9). It’s very important for you and your baby, especially during the first trimester, and even before.
You’ll need at least  600 micrograms (mcg) of folate  every day, which can be a challenge to achieve with foods alone. But legumes can  boost your folate levels  along with supplementation based on your doctor’s recommendation.
Legumes tend to be high in fiber, and some are also high in iron, magnesium, and potassium. Consider adding  legumes  to your diet with meals like hummus on whole grain toast, black beans in a taco salad, or a lentil curry.

3. Sweet potatoes
Sweet potatoes  are rich in beta-carotene, a plant compound that your body converts to vitamin A.
Vitamin A is essential for a baby’s development. However, too much vitamin A, from animal products — such as organ meats —  can cause toxicity .
Sweet potatoes are a good plant-based source of beta-carotene and  fiber . Fiber keeps you full longer, reduces blood sugar spikes, and improves digestive health, which can help reduce the risk of  pregnancy constipation .
Try sweet potatoes at breakfast time as a base for your  morning avocado toast .

4. Salmon
Smoked on a whole wheat bagel, teriyaki grilled, or  served with pesto , salmon is a welcome addition to this list.  Salmon  is rich in essential omega-3 fatty acids, which have a host of  benefits .
Omega-3s are present in seafood. They help build the brain and eyes of your baby and may help  increase gestational length .
While it’s best to avoid some seafoods during pregnancy, due to  mercury  and other contaminants, salmon, sardines, and anchovies are  safe to eat .
However, it’s worth checking where it was fished from, especially if it was locally caught. It’s also best to opt for fresh salmon, as smoked seafood  can carry  a risk of listeria.
Here are the high mercury fish to  avoid :
swordfish
shark
king mackerel
marlin
bigeye tuna
tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico

5. Eggs
Eggs are a  healthy food , as they contain a little of almost every nutrient you need. A large egg contains about  71 calories , 3.6 g of protein, fat, and many vitamins and minerals.
Eggs are a great source of  choline , a vital nutrient during pregnancy. It’s important in a baby’s brain development and helps prevent developmental abnormalities of the brain and spine.
A single whole egg contains roughly  147 milligrams (mg)  of choline, which will get you closer to the current recommended choline intake of  450 mg per day  while pregnant, though more studies are under way to determine if that is enough.
Here are some of the  healthiest ways  to cook eggs. Try them in  spinach feta wraps or a chickpea scramble .

6. Broccoli and dark, leafy greens
Broccoli and dark, green vegetables, such as  kale  and spinach, have many of the nutrients you’ll need. If you don’t like the flavors, you can disguise them by adding them to soups, pasta sauces, and more.
Benefits include fiber, vitamin C, vitamin K, vitamin A, calcium, iron, folate, and potassium. Their fiber content can also help prevent constipation.
Vegetables have also been linked to a  reduced risk of low birth weight .
Try this  kale eggs Florentine recipe  or blend some spinach into a  green smoothie , and you won’t even know it’s in there.

7. Lean meat and proteins
Lean beef, pork, and chicken are excellent sources of  high-quality protein . Beef and pork are also rich in iron, choline, and other B vitamins — all of which you’ll need in higher amounts during pregnancy.
Iron is an essential mineral used by red blood cells as a part of hemoglobin. You’ll need more iron since your blood volume is increasing, and especially during your third trimester.
Low levels of iron during early and mid-pregnancy may cause  iron deficiency  anemia, which increases the  risk of low birth weight  and other complications.
It can be hard to cover your iron needs with meals alone, especially if you develop an  aversion  to meat or follow a plant-based diet. However, for those who can, lean red meat may help increase the amount of iron you’re getting from food.
Pro tip: Pairing foods that are rich in vitamin C, such as oranges or bell peppers, along with  iron-rich foods  may also help  increase iron absorption .
Toss some vitamin C-rich tomato slices on that  turkey burger  or whip up  this steak and mango salad .

8. Berries
Berries  provide water, healthy carbs, vitamin C, fiber, and antioxidants. They also have a relatively low glycemic index value, so they should not cause significant  spikes in blood sugar .
Berries are a great snack, as they contain both water and fiber. They provide a lot of flavor and nutrition but with relatively few calories.
Some of the  best berries  to eat while pregnant are blueberries, raspberries, goji berries, strawberries, and acai berries. Check out  this blueberry smoothie  for some inspiration.

9. Whole grains
Unlike their refined counterparts,  whole grains  are packed with fiber, vitamins, and plant compounds. Think oats, quinoa, brown rice, wheat berries, and barley instead of white bread, pasta, and white rice.
Some whole grains, like oats and  quinoa , also contain a fair amount of protein, as well as B vitamins, fiber, and  magnesium .
There are many ways to add whole grains to any meal. Why not try this  quinoa and roasted sweet potato bowl ?

10. Avocados
Avocados   contain   monounsaturated fatty acids . This makes them taste buttery and rich — perfect for adding depth and creaminess to a dish.
They  also provide  fiber, antioxidants, B vitamins (especially folate), vitamin K, potassium, copper, vitamin E, and vitamin C.
Because of their high content of healthy fats, folate, and potassium, avocados are a great choice during pregnancy.
Healthy fats help build the skin, brain, and tissues of your little one, and folate may help prevent neural tube defects and developmental abnormalities of the brain and spine, such as spina bifida.
Potassium  may help relieve leg cramps, which can affect some people. In fact, avocados contain  more potassium  than bananas.
Try them as guacamole, in salads, in smoothies, and on whole wheat toast, but also as a  substitute for mayo  or sour cream.

11. Dried fruit
Dried fruit is generally high in calories, fiber, and various vitamins and minerals. One piece of dried fruit contains the same amount of nutrients as fresh fruit, just without all the water and in a much smaller form.
One serving of dried fruit can boost your intake of many vitamins and minerals, including folate, iron, and potassium.
Prunes  are rich in fiber, potassium, and vitamin K. They’re natural laxatives and may be very helpful in relieving constipation.  Dates  are high in fiber, potassium, iron, and plant compounds.
However,  dried fruit  also contains high amounts of natural sugar, and the candied varieties contain added sugar.
Try adding a small portion to a  trail mix  with nuts and seeds for an on-the-go protein- and fiber-filled snack.

12. Fish liver oil
Fish liver oil is made from the oily liver of fish, usually from  cod . It’s  rich in  the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, which are essential for fetal brain and eye development.
Supplementing with fish oil may help protect against preterm delivery and may benefit fetal eye development.
Fish liver oil is also very high in vitamin D, which many people lack. It may be beneficial if you don’t regularly eat seafood or if you don’t already supplement with omega-3 or vitamin D.
A tablespoon (4.5 grams) of fish liver oil provides  11 micrograms  (mcg) of vitamin D, or around  three-quarters  of a person’s daily needs, and 1,350 mcg of vitamin A, around  150%  of a person’s daily needs.
Speak with a doctor before using fish liver oil or other omega-3 supplements, as too much vitamin A or D can be dangerous. High levels of omega-3 may also have blood-thinning effects.
Low-mercury fish like salmon, sardines, canned light tuna, or pollock can also help boost omega-3 levels.

13. Water
Hydration is essential for everyone, but especially during pregnancy. During pregnancy, blood volume increases by about  45% .
You need plenty of water to stop both you and your baby becoming dehydrated.
Symptoms of mild dehydration include headaches, anxiety, tiredness, bad mood, and reduced memory.
Increasing your water intake may also help relieve constipation and reduce your risk of urinary tract infections, which are common during pregnancy.
The  American College of Gynecologists  recommends drinking 8–12 cups (64–96 ounces) of water per day during pregnancy. But the amount you really need varies. Ask your doctor for a recommendation based on your specific needs.
Keep in mind that you also get water from  other foods and beverages , such as fruit, vegetables, coffee, and tea.
Pro tip: Try keeping a  reusable water bottle  on hand so that you can quench your thirst throughout the day.
