“Hands down, this biotin supplement was the best I’ve ever tried. Added plus for the fact it’s vegan certified, so users who avoid gelatin can take this product! I also noticed my hair didn’t break as much in the shower or whenever I brushed my hair/ran my fingers through my hair. That made me really happy.”
— Parisa Syed, Healthline editor
Healthy hair, nails, and skin require sufficient nutrients, including vitamins A, D, and E. While these are commonly found in a balanced diet, some people — such as those with specific dietary restrictions or unique needs — may require more.
It’s important to acknowledge that for most people with good health, there’s limited evidence that taking targeted vitamins solely for hair, skin, or nails results in noticeable improvements.
However, if you have concerns about your nutritional intake and wish to ensure your hair, nails, and skin receive optimal support, our team of nutritionists has curated a selection of quality multivitamins and individual supplements designed to promote overall well-being, including the health of your hair, nails, and skin.

This product is a great option if you’re looking for a multivitamin that’s formulated to provide the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for essential nutrients along with specific nutrients to support healthy hair, skin, and nails.

Among the many vitamins included in this supplement is vitamin A, which can aid in  collagen production . This product also contains vitamin D, which  may be beneficial for acne .

Other notable ingredients are  collagen , a protein important for  skin elasticity  and  nail health , and zinc, an important mineral that supports collagen production and  may help treat acne , though more research is needed.

Also included is hyaluronic acid, which has been shown to help  boost skin moisture .

Para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), or vitamin B10, is also included and can help absorb UVB rays that are associated with sunburn and DNA damage. It may also help with  repigmentation  of graying hair, but  research on this effect is limited , and what’s available measures the results of only high doses.

How we chose
Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the brands on this page, we considered all the vitamin brands that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further.
To help you decide which products are worth considering, Healthline researched the best hair, skin, and nails vitamins using the following criteria:
Vetting:  All the products included  have been vetted  to ensure that they meet Healthline’s medical and business standards. These products meet the allowable health claims and labeling requirements of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and they’re manufactured in facilities that adhere to current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs).
Ingredients:  We aimed to include several options that are free from potentially unwanted ingredients like artificial flavors or sweeteners, certain allergens, and additives and preservatives.
Price:  We included supplements to fit a wide range of budgets.
User reviews:  All the vitamins on this list have mostly favorable customer reviews.
Trustworthiness:  We also chose products only from medically credible companies that follow industry best standards. Many also provide objective measures of trust, like third-party certifications.

How to choose hair, nails, and skin supplements
Shopping for a hair, nails, and skin supplement can be overwhelming. Here are a few key factors to consider.
Look for products with a minimal list of unnecessary additives and fillers.
Some additives and preservatives, like soybean oil, glycerin, and soy lecithin serve a vital role in extending a vitamin’s shelf life, but it’s essential to differentiate them from fillers. Fillers are ingredients that contribute little or no nutritional value but are added to bulk up a product and can ultimately dilute the essential nutrients in a supplement.
While complete elimination of additives isn’t necessary, prioritize supplements with essential nutrients without unnecessary extras.
Additionally, hair, skin, and nail vitamins often contain proprietary blends, and manufacturers don’t disclose the exact amounts of the ingredients used in the blends. If the product contains proprietary blends of ingredients you have to be cautious of, it may be best to choose a different product.
It’s also worth noting that while some ingredients in these supplements have shown effectiveness in other areas, research on their direct benefits for hair, nails, and skin remains limited. For example, a  biotin deficiency  may lead to seizures, skin infections, brittle nails, and hair loss, but there’s no concrete evidence to suggest supplementation will specifically strengthen your hair or nails.
The multifaceted nature of these supplements means that while they may contribute to overall well-being, specific outcomes related to hair, nails, and skin can vary.
Any time you purchase supplements, it’s important to buy from a trusted source.
For an extra level of reassurance, look for vitamins that are tested by a third-party organization like  USP ,  NSF , or  ConsumerLab  whenever possible. This guarantees that the product contains the types and amounts of ingredients that are listed on the bottle.
While not all the products on our recommended list are third-party certified, we aim to provide a range of options that cater to different preferences.
The availability of third-party certification can depend on various factors, including the manufacturer’s commitment to rigorous testing standards and the specific certification programs applicable to the products.
Some ingredients may be unsafe  if you’re pregnant or nursing .  Additionally, some commonly used ingredients, such as  horsetail,  may interact with some medications, so it’s wise to  talk with a healthcare professional before adding a new supplement to your routine.

Frequently asked questions
There’s some research to support the use of certain ingredients for  hair growth  and health, such as  DHA omega-3s . Deficiencies in  other nutrients  like B vitamins, iron, and vitamins C, and D have been linked to poor hair growth.
However, there’s currently insufficient evidence to confirm the benefits of supplementing with these nutrients specifically for hair growth.

However, there’s currently insufficient evidence to confirm the benefits of supplementing with these nutrients specifically for hair growth.
The best supplement for hair and nail growth can vary from person to person, as individual needs and responses to supplements differ. Some commonly used ingredients, like biotin, actually lack sufficient evidence in terms of promoting hair and nail growth. However, ingredients like omega-3 DHA, collagen, and hyaluronic acid may be effective.
Nutrafol has been shown to promote hair growth in women with self-perceived hair thinning, though it’s worth noting  the clinical trial  was self-funded, which may be a conflict of interest.

Still, it’s important to keep in mind that the overall research on these supplements is limited. As a result, more robust studies are needed before we can confidently say whether hair, nails, and skin vitamins are effective.

The bottom line
While not all supplements are created equal, some contain ingredients that may be beneficial for your hair, skin, and nails.
With so many options to choose from, it’s important to do your research ahead of time to know which product is the best fit for you.
Especially if you’re taking other supplements or prescription medications or are pregnant or nursing, it’s wise to talk with a healthcare professional before trying any new supplements.
Remember that supplements are not meant to replace other healthy lifestyle habits, such as eating a balanced diet, staying hydrated, managing stress levels, and  getting quality sleep , all of which also contribute to healthier hair, skin, and nails.
