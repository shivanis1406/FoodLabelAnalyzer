Title: The 20 Best Foods for People with Kidney Disease

If you have kidney disease, you may need to follow a special diet. While this diet may not completely heal your kidneys, it may help protect them from further damage.
When your kidneys aren’t working properly, waste builds up in the blood, including waste products from food. People with kidney disease can benefit from following a special diet known as a renal diet.
Here, we look at 20 of the best foods for people with kidney disease.

Diet and kidney disease
Dietary restrictions vary depending on the level of kidney damage. People with later-stage kidney disease will have  different limits  from those with early kidney disease.
The diet will need to boost kidney function at any stage while  lowering the risk  of further damage.
While dietary restrictions vary, people with  kidney disease  typically need to  restrict the following nutrients . The kidneys may have difficulty removing or processing these nutrients, and high levels can cause damage to the body.
Since kidney disease is closely linked to heart disease, it’s best to combine these choices with a  heart-healthy diet  — one that contains plenty of fresh, plant-based foods and is low in saturated fats.
Individuals with kidney disease have a unique experience, so it’s important to talk with a doctor about your specific dietary needs.

What foods help kidneys repair?
Here are 20 foods that may improve kidney health or prevent it from worsening:

1. Cauliflower
Cauliflower  provides many nutrients, including vitamin K, folate, and fiber. It  also contains  antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds.
Try mashed cauliflower in place of potato for a low potassium side dish.
One-half cup or about 62 grams (g) of boiled cauliflower without salt  contains :
sodium:  9.3 milligrams (mg)
potassium:  88 mg
phosphorus:  20 mg
protein:  1 g

2. Blueberries
Blueberries  are rich in nutrients and antioxidants known as anthocyanins, which  may protect  against heart disease, diabetes, and other diseases.
They’re also low in sodium, phosphorus, and potassium.
One cup (148 g) of fresh blueberries  contains :
sodium:  1.5 mg
potassium:  114 mg
phosphorus:  18 mg
protein:  1 g

3. Sea bass
Sea bass is a fish option that provides high quality protein. It also contains healthy fats called  omega-3s . Omega-3s  may help  prevent a range of diseases and boost the health of those living with long-term conditions.
Three ounces (85 g) of cooked sea bass  contains :
sodium:  74 mg
potassium:  279 mg
phosphorus:  211 mg
protein:  20 g
However, the  National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)  recommends eating small portions of meat or fish, as high protein levels can make the kidneys work harder.
One portion is 2–3 ounces of chicken, fish, or meat, or a piece around the size of a deck of cards.

4. Red grapes
Red grapes are a  good source  of antioxidants called  flavonoids , which may  help reduce  inflammation and protect against heart disease, diabetes, and other health conditions.

sodium:  1.5 mg
potassium:  144 mg
phosphorus:  15 mg
protein:  0.5 g

5. Egg whites
Egg whites  provide a high quality, kidney-friendly source of protein that is low in phosphorus.
Egg whites may be a better choice than whole eggs for people on a renal diet, as egg yolks  can be high  in phosphorus.
Two large, raw egg whites (66 g)  contain :
sodium:  110 mg
potassium:  108 mg
phosphorus:  10 mg
protein:  7 g

6. Garlic

Olive oil  is a healthy source of vitamin E and mostly unsaturated fat. It’s also phosphorus-free, making it a suitable option for people with kidney disease.
Most of the fat in olive oil is oleic acid,  which has  anti-inflammatory properties.
What’s more, monounsaturated fats are  more stable at high temperatures , making olive oil a healthy choice for cooking.
One tablespoon (14 g) of olive oil  contains :
sodium:  0.3 mg
potassium:  0.1 mg
phosphorus:  0 mg
protein:  0 g

9. Bulgur

protein:  3 g

10. Cabbage
Cabbage  belongs to the cruciferous vegetable family and provides vitamins, minerals, and antioxidant compounds.
The authors of a  2021 study  note that cabbage contains bioactive compounds that might help manage blood sugar and reduce the risk of kidney and liver damage, though research in humans is needed.
White, green, and red cabbage may help:
manage blood sugar
reduce the risk of kidney and liver damage
prevent oxidative stress and obesity
A cup (70 g) of shredded savoy cabbage  contains :

NIDDK advises  people with kidney disease to limit portions of meat and fish to 2–3 ounces, as high protein levels can make your kidneys work harder.

12. Bell peppers
Bell peppers  are high in vitamins A and C and other antioxidants but low in potassium.
These nutrients are important for immune function, which is  closely linked  with kidney disease.
One medium red pepper (119 g)  contains :
sodium:  less than 2.5 mg
potassium:  213 mg
phosphorus:  27 mg
protein:  1 g

13. Onions
Reducing salt can be challenging, but  onions  are one way of providing sodium-free flavor to renal diet dishes.

Cranberries are also low in potassium, phosphorus, and sodium.
There are close links between  urinary tract infections (UTIs)  and kidney infections, and a UTI  can lead to  kidney complications.
You can eat cranberries dried, cooked, fresh, or as a juice.
One cup (100 g) of whole, fresh cranberries  contains :
sodium:  2 mg

Frequently asked questions
It may not be possible to heal your kidneys, but according to the  NIDDK , it may be possible to manage your kidney disease with dietary changes such as:
avoiding too much salt and  sodium
getting enough, but not  too much protein
following a  heart-healthy diet
limiting alcohol consumption
avoiding foods and drinks with  too much phosphorus  and  potassium
The  National Kidney Foundation  recommends the following to help keep your kidneys healthy:
manage high blood pressure levels
maintain ideal blood sugar levels
avoid eating too much protein
lower your salt intake
avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), aspirin, and naproxen (Naprosyn)
get your annual flu shot
Water is the best option as it flushes out the kidneys without adding potassium or phosphorus. Unsweetened cranberry juice is also a good option, as it contains antioxidants that may protect against urinary tract infections. You might also try rice milk that’s not enriched with potassium or phosphorus.
Limit or avoid alcohol, as this can increase your chances of developing several health problems.
Foods to avoid if you have kidney disease are mainly those that are high in sodium, phosphorus, or both. Individual dietary choices will depend on your stage of kidney disease and blood tests.
Ultimately, people with CKD need to consult with a dietitian for personalized advice.
Here are some items you may want to avoid or limit:
processed foods or premade meals, which tend to have added sodium
canned foods with added salt — opt for salt-free or rinse them before using them
large portions of protein foods, such as meat or dairy foods
alcohol
deli meats
Learn more about which foods to avoid if you have kidney disease.

The bottom line
People with kidney disease have to manage their intake of phosphorus, salt, and potassium. At certain stages, they may also need to limit their protein intake.
As nutritional needs and restrictions change during the course of the disease, it’s best to speak with a doctor or registered dietitian before making any dietary changes. They will help you work out a diet suitable for you.
Suitable options may include chicken, shiitake mushrooms, cranberries, macadamia nuts, and a wide range of other tasty and nutritious foods.
