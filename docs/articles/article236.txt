Title: Is Plexus a Safe and Effective Way to Lose Weight? A Dietitian’s Opinion

There’s no research supporting the safety of Plexus supplements. Though you may lose weight on a Plexus diet, the weight you lose is likely water weight that you’ll gain back at the end of the diet.
Plexus is a dietary supplement company that’s best known for its “pink drinks,” such as Plexus Slim Hunger Control or Plexus Slim Microbiome Activating. They are sold as powdered supplements meant to suppress appetite and help you lose weight.
Over the past few years, the company’s product line has greatly expanded to include items like the Plexus Block, which is purported to help metabolize carbohydrates, and Plexus MetaBurn, which claims to boost metabolism and burn fat.
Despite their popularity, you may be wondering whether Plexus weight loss supplements are worth the money or even safe to take.
This article explores the effectiveness and safety of the most popular Plexus weight loss products.

What is Plexus?
Plexus is a supplement company that sells a variety of products designed to help improve overall health.
Plexus grew in popularity thanks to its “pink drink.” In recent years, Plexus has expanded its offerings to include products for gut health, weight loss, and skin care.
Even more recently, the company has begun offering Plexus Pivotal, a 90-day program that includes weekly tips, recipes, workouts, and motivation designed to help customers stay on track with the products.
Still, despite its expanded product line and program, the company continues to be known for its weight loss regimens and bold health claims.

Company reputation
Plexus operates using a multilevel marketing (MLM) structure. This means that products are largely marketed and sold by brand ambassadors.
Like many other MLMs, the company makes extravagant claims about brand ambassadors’ profit-making capability. However, according to the Plexus website, the average brand ambassador made just $544 over the year in 2020 ( 1 ).
What’s more, brand ambassadors are Plexus customers, rather than qualified healthcare professionals. This can be dangerous, as brand ambassadors often recommend products to new customers despite lacking proper education on nutrition and supplements.
The company is also known to make bold claims regarding the effectiveness of its products without clinical evidence or third-party testing to support them.
Furthermore, in 2020, Plexus received a letter of warning from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in regards to social media posts that claimed that Plexus products could help treat or prevent COVID-19 ( 2 ).
With such big claims, many customers are enticed by Plexus products and brand ambassadorship. However, evidence supporting the income of brand ambassadors and the effectiveness of Plexus products is lacking.

Who is Plexus for?
According to the website, Plexus is for individuals looking to lose weight or improve overall health and well-being.
The company also has a program called Plexus Pivotal. According to Plexus, participants will receive weekly content that educates them on building healthy habits.
The program could be helpful for someone who is independent and feels confident tackling weight loss on their own or has already sought other support.
However, research shows that strategies such as keeping a food diary, maintaining a good support system, and setting goals are some of the most effective methods for successful weight loss. So, for someone just getting started, this program may not be enough ( 3 ).
Additionally, diet and lifestyle sustainability are important for success. Research shows that adherence to a diet, rather than the specific diet itself, is important for success ( 4 ).
Anyone considering Plexus should also consider whether it’s financially feasible long-term. The packages are relatively costly, and the company provides few guidelines on how long to take the products. Therefore, you may find this weight loss approach difficult to maintain over time.
Finally, no specific research supports the safety of Plexus supplements, and they are not third-party tested. It’s best for certain individuals, such as children and people who are pregnant or nursing, to avoid these products.

How much does Plexus cost?
The cost varies depending on which combination package you purchase and whether you’re a VIP customer.
Plexus weight management combos are designed to provide 30-days-worth of product and vary in the types of products included.
Here’s an overview of the price and what’s included for each weight management combo:
VIP customers pay a $9.95 sign-up fee along with an annual $19.95 annual fee in order to receive up to 25% off products.
Additionally, all customers have the option to sign up for a monthly subscription with a 10% discount after the first two consecutive subscription orders.

How Plexus weight management regimens work
Plexus offers three weight management product combinations, including Weight Loss Basics, Weight Loss Plus, and Weight Loss Advanced.
Here are the products found in various weight loss combos:
Plexus Lean.  Lean is a  protein powder  that comes in both chocolate and vanilla flavors, as well as either whey or vegan protein. For weight loss, the website suggests using Lean as a replacement for two meals per day.
Slim Hunger Control and Microbiome Activating.  These powders come in a variety of flavors and are recommended to be mixed with water and consumed 30–60 minutes before a meal twice a day. Slim Hunger Control is purported to suppress appetite, while the Microbiome Activating powder claims to support gut health.
MetaBurn.  These capsules claim to support fat burning and  boost energy levels . Individuals are encouraged to take one capsule, twice a day.
Active or Hydrate.  These drink mixes are included in the Plus and Advanced combos and are claimed to help boost either hydration (Hydrate) or energy levels (Active). They’re designed to be mixed with water and be consumed at any time.
BioCleanse.  These capsules are included in the Advanced combo and claim to help reduce gas, bloating, and stomach discomfort. Individuals are instructed to take 2 capsules with 8 ounces (236.6 mL) of water twice daily between meals.
The ProBio 5.  These capsule are also included in the Advanced combo. The website recommends taking one capsule every night before bed to promote gut health and support digestion.
While there are instructions on how to take each of the products, and even recommendations for decreasing meal replacement shakes once you reach your weight goal, there are no guidelines for how long to continue taking these products for.

Product ingredients and nutrition
Here’s a closer look at the ingredients and nutrition facts of the main Plexus weight management products, including Plexus Lean, Slim Hunger Control and Microbiome Activating, MetaBurn, and Block.
According to the company’s website, Plexus Lean provides protein along with  prebiotic fiber , which Plexus claims can help keep you full so that you’ll eat less throughout the day.
Plexus Lean is designed to be used as a  meal replacement  for 2 meals per day for weight loss, or for 1 meal per day for weight maintenance.
The nutritional information for 2 scoops (40 grams) of the chocolate Lean Whey is as follows ( 5 ):
Calories:  140
Fat:  3 grams
Saturated fat:  1.5 grams
Carbohydrates:  12 grams
Fiber:  5 grams
Sugar:  3 grams (includes 1 gram of added sugar)
Protein:  21 grams
The vanilla Lean Whey is slightly different in terms of nutritional information ( 6 ):
Calories: 140
Fat: 3.5 grams
Saturated fat: 1 gram
Carbohydrates: 11 grams
Fiber: 5 grams
Total sugars 3 grams (includes 1 gram of added sugar)
Protein: 21 grams
The nutritional information for 2 scoops (48 grams) of the chocolate Lean Vegan prepared with water is as follows ( 7 ):
Calories:  140
Fat:  3.5 grams
Saturated fat: .5 grams
Carbohydrates:  11 grams
Fiber:  7 grams
Sugar:  2 grams
Protein:  21 grams
The vanilla Lean Vegan is nearly identical ( 8 ).
Calories:  140
Fat:  3 grams
Saturated fat: .5 grams
Carbohydrates:  12 grams
Fiber:  7 grams
Sugar:  1 grams
Protein:  21 grams
Below is an overview of the ingredients found in the Lean shakes.
The Lean Whey shakes are made with a combination of  whey concentrate  and whey isolate proteins and are meant to support lean muscle growth.
Research supports the use of  whey protein , or other complete sources of protein, like chicken or beef, for supporting muscle mass and benefits in body composition ( 9 ).
The vegan variety of the Lean shake contains a protein blend made from pea and almond proteins, rather than whey protein, which is derived from cows.
Research shows  pea protein  to be beneficial for supporting lean muscle mass, and some studies have found it to be comparable to whey protein for improving body composition ( 10 ).
Furthermore, research suggests that  pea and whey protein  powder produce similar results when it comes to improving muscle thickness, strength, and overall exercise performance ( 11 ).
The Lean supplement contains prebiotic fiber from polydextrose, which, according to the company’s website, enhances the growth of healthy bacteria in the gut.
Polydextrose has been found to promote health gut bacteria and even improve cognitive function ( 12 ,  13 ).
The  digestive enzymes  in Lean come from  Aspergillus oryzae  and  Aspergillus niger  — plant fungi that are used to produce digestive enzymes ( 14 ).
Plexus claims that these digestive enzymes will make it easier for you to digest the protein found in Plexus Lean.
Research shows that some individuals, such as those with a lactose intolerance or cystic fibrosis, may benefit from digestive enzymes ( 15 ).
However, it’s unclear if digestive enzymes offer the same effect in those without lactose intolerance or another gastrointestinal condition.
Lean also contains 21 vitamins and minerals.
Flax seeds  are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which may help reduce the risk of some disease, such as heart disease, cancer, and some neurological disorders ( 16 ).
Both the whey and vegan Lean products are sweetened with coconut sugar and stevia leaf extract.
All weight loss combos come with a choice of either Plexus Slim Hunger Control or Microbiome Activating powder.
The main difference between the two is that the Hunger Control contains polydextrose, a type of  soluble fiber , while Microbiome Activating contains prebiotics called xylooligosaccharides (XOS).
The nutritional information for 1 packet of Plexus Slim Hunger Control ( 17 ):
Calories:  15
Fat:  0 grams
Saturated fat:  0 grams
Carbohydrates:  8 grams
Fiber:  6 grams
Sugar:  0 grams
Protein:  0 grams
The nutritional information for 1 packet of Plexus Microbiome Activating ( 18 ):
Calories:  5
Fat:  0 grams
Saturated fat:  0 grams
Carbohydrates:  2 grams
Fiber:  0 grams
Sugar:  0 grams
Protein:  0 grams
Plexus claims that Slim Hunger Control is designed to help individuals feel full, thanks to its polydextrose content.
Polydextrose is a soluble fiber that’s commonly used as a bulking agent and thickener in commercial food products ( 19 ).
Some research suggests that polydextrose may improve postprandial  blood sugar levels  (blood sugar levels after a meal), decrease overall caloric intake by enhancing satiety, and improve overall bowel function ( 19 ).
However, the review includes both animal and human studies. More human research is needed ( 19 ).
According to Plexus, XOS is a “clinically demonstrated prebiotic that feeds beneficial microbes.”
By nature, prebiotics can feed gut microbiota and support an overall  healthy gut  ( 20 ).
Regular consumption of XOS, specifically in the form of a rice porridge, has been associated with an improved microbiota balance ( 21 ).
According to the company’s website,  green coffee bean extract  helps support glucose metabolism by decreasing the absorption of sugars.
There is some research to support the use of green coffee bean extract for decreasing fasting blood glucose levels, as well as insulin and triglyceride levels ( 22 ).
Additionally, a review found that green coffee bean extract may help improve weight loss, especially in individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of greater than 25 ( 23 ).
While green coffee bean extract may have some benefits for  weight loss  and blood sugar regulation, the research is currently inconclusive.
Furthermore, there’s currently no research supporting the company’s claim that green coffee bean extract decreases the body’s absorption of sugars.
Chromium  is an essential mineral that plays an important role in breaking down carbs, fat, and protein, making it a popular ingredient in weight loss supplements.
One review found that taking chromium supplements was linked to weight loss and reductions in body fat percentages in people with overweight and obesity. However, larger and more long-term studies are needed to confirm these effects ( 24 ).
Plexus MetaBurn is a capsule that’s marketed as a way to boost fat burning and  reduce abdominal fat .
Below is a closer look at the main ingredients found in Plexus MetaBurn.
Plexus claims that grains of paradise — which come from a West African plant,  Aframomum melegueta  — have metabolism-enhancing benefits.
One small study found that regular consumption of grains of paradise induced  thermogenesis , increased energy expenditure, and reduced body fat in healthy young men ( 25 ).
Another study suggested that grains of paradise, along with other herbs, may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties ( 26 ).
While promising, more research, particularly in the form of large human clinical trials, is needed.
According to the company’s website, the combination of L-theanine and  caffeine  in Plexus MetaBurn is meant to support mood and mental alertness.
Limited research suggests that  L-theanine  may help reduce stress and anxiety levels, though more long-term data is needed ( 27 ).
Some studies have also found that the combination of L-theanine and caffeine may improve focus and attention ( 28 ,  29 ).
Plexus claims  rhodiola  supports a healthy mood.
Rhodiola is an herb that’s traditionally used as an  adaptogen , or a plant that is thought to have stress-relieving benefits ( 30 ,  31 ).
Additionally, research suggests that rhodiola may contain anti-aging, anti-cancer, and anti-stress properties ( 30 ,  32 ).
However, evidence on the effectiveness of rhodiola supplements on mood is limited ( 33 ).
Plexus Block is marketed as supplement that can lower the  glycemic index of food  and reduce the absorption of carbohydrates.
Plexus recommends taking two capsules a day, ideally before your highest carbohydrate meal.
Plexus claims the brown  seaweed  blend and white kidney bean extract in Plexus Block reduces the glycemic index of foods, thereby helping reduce blood sugar spikes after eating.
Some test-tube studies suggest that brown seaweed may help in the prevention and management of metabolic syndrome, as well as other diseases, by aiding in blood sugar management. However, human clinical trials are lacking in quality and have shown varied results ( 34 ,  35 ).
White kidney bean extract contains  alpha-amylase inhibitor , which blocks the absorption of carbohydrates. However, it’s unclear whether white kidney bean extract has a significant effect on carbohydrate absorption and weight loss ( 36 ,  37 ).
Lastly, it’s important to note that this is a proprietary blend, which means the exact amounts of ingredients are not disclosed.
Also present in Slim Hunger Control and Microbiome Activating, chromium picolinate is an ingredient that’s often found in weight loss supplements due to its role in nutrient metabolism.
While some research supports the use of chromium supplements for aiding weight loss, more studies are needed ( 24 ).

Is Plexus effective for weight loss?
Plexus may be effective for weight loss, particularly because it encourages you to consume fewer calories each day. However, it’s likely too low in calories for adults.
Most adults should consume at least 1,500 calories per day, and prolonged low calorie intake can harm your metabolism ( 38 ,  39 ).
Even if you see initial weight loss on this type of diet, it’s most likely from water loss and you’ll likely gain the weight back once the diet ends.
Specifically, the company’s website recommends replacing two meals a day with a Plexus Lean shake, one serving of which is about 230 calories when mixed with nonfat milk, depending on the flavor.
Research shows that diets featuring meal replacement shakes are effective for weight loss, so you may lose weight by replacing two meals a day with Plexus Lean shakes ( 40 ).
However there’s currently no evidence to confirm the effectiveness of Plexus supplements for weight loss.

Are Plexus products safe?
On a similar note, there’s no research supporting the safety of Plexus supplements.
Furthermore, Plexus products aren’t third-party tested for purity and accuracy.
Some customers complain of side effects after taking Plexus products, including bloating, gas, nausea, stomach ache, and constipation.
There have also been reports of more serious negative outcomes, including one person who developed a blood disorder known as secondary  immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)  after consuming Plexus Slim ( 41 ).
However, Plexus products haven’t officially been proven to be the cause of more serious side effects, such as ITP.
Due to a lack of research on the safety of the products, Plexus supplements shouldn’t be consumed by children or people who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
It’s also important to consult a healthcare professional before trying any new supplement.

When to see a doctor
If you’ve been trying to lose weight without success, you might consider seeking the opinion of a healthcare professional, such as your doctor, or a registered dietitian.
Because no research-based evidence supports the use of Plexus supplements for weight loss, you may have more success working with a professional who can help you set realistic goals and build sustainable habits informed by your needs and dietary restrictions.
Additionally, some individuals have reported experiencing side effects after using Plexus supplements.
If you’ve been using the products and are noticing any side effects, such as gas, nausea, or other stomach discomfort, it’s a good idea to stop using the supplements immediately and consult a healthcare professional.

Frequently asked questions
The FDA regulates supplements differently from foods and medicines. Foods and medicines must be proven safe before manufacturers can make them available to consumers.
However, the FDA does not have the authority to approve supplements for safety before they are widely sold. This is true of all supplements, not just Plexus products ( 42 ).
This is because there are no legal provisions for the FDA to approve supplements before they reach consumers.
The Plexus pink drink is officially called Plexus Slim Hunger Control. It’s a powdered supplement designed to suppress appetite when mixed with water and consumed 30–60 minutes before a meal.
The powder is made of polydextrose, a soluble fiber. In preliminary studies on animals, researchers found that the fiber may help lower overall food intake by increasing fullness. However, more research is needed ( 43 ).
It’s unclear whether Plexus products are safe for weight loss because they have not been explicitly tested or certified by third-party agencies.
It’s also worth noting that there have been anecdotal complaints of side effects and some reports of more serious complications from taking the products ( 44 ).

The bottom line
Plexus is a dietary supplement company that’s best known for its weight loss products.
However, due to a lack of research and third-party testing, it’s unclear whether Plexus supplements are truly safe or effective.
The company’s suggested weight loss regimen is also extremely restrictive and doesn’t teach important skills for building long-lasting, healthy habits.
What’s more, starting at $150 per month, Plexus weight loss combos aren’t cheap.
For all of these reasons, we recommend a more realistic approach to weight loss, such as meal planning apps,  healthy meal delivery services , or working with a registered dietitian.
While we don’t recommend Plexus for weight loss, there are more realistic and sustainable alternatives worth considering. Here are our top picks:
PlateJoy.  Customized to fit your health goals and dietary preferences,  PlateJoy  is a dietitian-created app that makes it easy to plan, shop for, and cook healthy meals throughout the week.
