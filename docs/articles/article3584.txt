Title: What are the Health and Nutritional Benefits of Pomegranate?

Pomegranates are low in calories and fat but high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Benefits include antioxidants, heart health, urinary health, exercise endurance, and more.
Pomegranates are round, red fruits. They feature a white inner flesh that’s packed with crunchy, juicy edible seeds called arils.
They may be best known for the vibrantly colored juice they’re often used in, but these unique fruits have a lot more to offer.
This article examines the many health benefits of pomegranates.

1. Packed with nutrients
Overall, pomegranates are low in calories and fat but high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals.
Below is the nutrition for the arils in  one  average pomegranate:
Calories:  234
Protein:  4.7 grams (g)
Fat:  3.3 g
Carbohydrates:  52 g
Fiber:  11.3 g
Vitamin C:  32% of the Daily Value (DV)
Folate:  27% of the DV
Magnesium:  8% of the DV
Phosphorus:  8% of the DV
Potassium:  13% of the DV
Keep in mind that the nutritional information for pomegranate and arils  differs  from that of pomegranate juice, which won’t provide much fiber or vitamin C.
Pomegranates in their whole fruit form are low in calories and fat and high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals.

2. Rich in antioxidants
Antioxidants  are compounds that help protect the cells of your body from damage caused by free radicals. High amounts of free radicals can be harmful and contribute to a number of chronic diseases.
Pomegranates  are rich  in antioxidants and  polyphenolic compounds , including punicalagins, anthocyanins, and hydrolyzable tannins.
Getting antioxidants from fruits such as pomegranates is a great way to support overall health and prevent disease.
Pomegranates are rich in an array of antioxidants that help protect your cells from free radical damage.

3. May help keep inflammation at bay
Chronic  inflammation  can  contribute  to many conditions, including heart disease,  type 2 diabetes , and cancer .
Eating pomegranates may help prevent the inflammation associated with these chronic conditions.
This is largely attributed to compounds called punicalagins, which  have been shown  to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
While more research is needed,  research  shows that consuming pomegranate juice can reduce certain markers of inflammation.
Although more research is needed, pomegranates contain compounds that may help prevent chronic inflammation associated with disease.

4. May have anticancer properties
Research  has found that compounds in pomegranate have anti-cancer properties.
Animal  research  has also found that pomegranate helps slow tumor growth in the early stages of  liver cancer .
Plus, according to older  research , pomegranate extract may be beneficial for prostate cancer.
Pomegranate has been observed to have anticancer effects. It may slow tumor growth and spread and reduce inflammation, although more research is needed to learn more.

5. May offer heart health benefits
There is  evidence  that fruits rich in polyphenolic compounds, such as pomegranate, may benefit heart health.
For example, in a  study  on people with heart disease, drinking pomegranate juice reduced the frequency and severity of  chest pain , as well as certain biomarkers that suggest a protective effect on heart health.
Compounds in pomegranate may reduce blood pressure, decrease plaque buildup, and reduce chest pain.

6. Support urinary health
Test-tube and human studies have found that pomegranate extract may help reduce the formation of  kidney stones .
In one  2014 study , pomegranate extract was found to inhibit the mechanism associated with stone formation in people with recurrent kidney stones.
Additionally, animal  studies  have found that pomegranate extract can help regulate the concentration of  oxalates ,  calcium , and phosphates in the blood, which are common components of kidney stones.
Certain compounds in pomegranate may help prevent kidney stones.

7. May have antimicrobial properties
Pomegranate compounds  may help  fight harmful microorganisms.
For instance, they  may protect  oral health by reducing the growth of germs that can contribute to  bad breath  and tooth decay.
Pomegranates contain compounds that help fight off potentially harmful bacteria, fungi, and yeasts — particularly germs in the mouth that can cause bad breath and tooth decay.

8. May improve exercise endurance
The  polyphenols  in pomegranates may increase  exercise endurance .
One small  study  found that pomegranate extract increased time to exhaustion and improved performance in trained cyclists.
Other  research  has found that pomegranate supplements may improve both endurance and muscle recovery.
However,  research  using pomegranate juice has found no benefit for muscle recovery after exercise, indicating that more studies are needed.
Pomegranates contain compounds that may improve endurance and recovery.

9. Good for your brain
Pomegranates contain antioxidants called ellagitannins, which  help reduce inflammation  in the body.
Some  studies  have found that ellagitannins  may help protect  the brain against Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease by reducing  oxidative damage  and increasing the survival of brain cells.
Ellagitannins are believed to produce a compound in the gut called urolithin A, which has been studied for its ability to  reduce inflammation  in the brain and delay the onset of cognitive diseases.
Nonetheless, more research is needed.
Compounds in pomegranate may help protect brain health and prevent Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.

10. Supports digestive health
Eating pomegranate  may help  support the health of your  gut microbiome , which plays a key role in many aspects of health.
Test-tube  research  has found that pomegranate can increase levels of  beneficial gut bacteria , suggesting that it may have prebiotic effects.
Prebiotics  serve as fuel for the  beneficial bacteria in your gut  and support a healthier gut microbiome.
Additionally, pomegranate arils are rich in fiber, which is  essential  for  digestive health  and may protect against some digestive conditions.
Pomegranate arils are also rich in fiber, which serves as fuel for probiotics and helps prevent certain digestive health conditions.
