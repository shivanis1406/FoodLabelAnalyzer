Title: The 8 Best Exercises for Weight Loss

Many types of physical activity can support weight loss by increasing the calories you burn. The amount of weight you can expect to lose may vary depending on your age, diet, and starting weight.
Estimates state that  around half  of all American adults attempt to lose weight yearly.
Exercising is one of the most common strategies employed by those trying to shed a few pounds. It burns calories, and this plays a key role in weight loss.
In addition to helping you lose weight, exercise has many other benefits, including  improved mood ,  stronger bones , and a  reduced risk  of many chronic diseases.
Here are the eight best exercises for weight loss.

1. Walking
Walking  can be a convenient way for many beginners to exercise without feeling overwhelmed or needing to purchase equipment. It’s also a  lower-impact exercise , meaning it’s less likely to stress your joints.
According to the  American Council on Exercise , a 140-pound (65-kilogram) person burns about 7.6  calories  per minute walking. A 180-pound (81-kg) person burns about 9.7 calories per minute walking.
A  12-week study  of 20 women with  obesity  found that walking for 50–70 minutes 3 times per week reduced body fat and waist circumference by an average of 1.5% and 1.1 inches (2.8 cm), respectively.
To  get started , aim to walk for 30 minutes 3–4 times a week. You can gradually increase the duration or frequency of your walks as you become more fit.

2. Jogging or running
Although they seem similar, the key difference is that a  jogging  pace is generally between 4–6 mph (6.4–9.7 km/h), while a  running  pace is faster than 6 mph (9.7 km/h).
The  American Council on Exercise  estimates that a 140-pound (65-kg) person burns about 10.8 calories per minute jogging and 13.2 calories per minute when running.
A 180-pound (81-kg) person burns about 13.9 calories per minute jogging and 17 calories per minute when running.
Researchers  have found  that jogging and running can help burn  visceral fat , commonly known as belly fat. This type of fat wraps around your internal organs and has  links to  various chronic diseases like  heart disease  and  diabetes .
To  get started , aim to jog for 20–30 minutes 3–4 times per week.
If you find jogging or running outdoors  hard on your joints , try running on softer surfaces like grass. Many  treadmills  have built-in cushioning, which may be easier on your joints.

3. Cycling
Cycling  is a non-weight-bearing and low impact exercise, so it won’t place much stress on your joints.
The  American Council on Exercise  estimates that a 140-pound (65-kg) person burns about 6.4 calories per minute cycling at a speed of 10 miles per hour (MPH). A 180-pound (81-kg) person burns about 8.2 calories per minute cycling at 10 MPH.
Studies have also found that people who cycle regularly have better overall fitness,  increased insulin sensitivity , and a lower risk of heart disease,  cancer , and death than those who don’t cycle regularly.
Although cycling is traditionally an outdoor activity, many gyms and fitness centers have  stationary bikes  that allow you to cycle while  staying indoors .

4. Weight training
Weight training  can help build strength and promote muscle growth, raising your  resting metabolic rate (RMR) , or how many calories your body burns at rest.
The  American Council on Exercise  estimates that a 140-pound (65-kg) person burns about 7.6 calories per minute of weight training. A 180-pound person burns about 9.8 calories per minute of weight training.
One  6-month study  showed that doing 11 minutes of  strength-based exercises  three times per week resulted in an average 7.4% increase in  metabolic rate . In this study, that increase was equivalent to burning an additional 125 calories per day.
Another study  found that 24 weeks of weight training led to a 9% increase in men’s metabolic rate, equating to burning approximately 140 more calories per day. Among women, the  increase in metabolic rate  was nearly 4% or 50 more calories per day.
In addition, studies  have shown  that your body continues to burn calories many hours after a weight-training workout, compared with aerobic exercise.

5. Interval training
Interval training, more commonly known as  high intensity interval training (HIIT),  is a broad term for short bursts of intense exercise that alternate with recovery periods.
Typically, a HIIT workout lasts 10–30 minutes and can burn many calories.
One study  of 9 active men found that HIIT burned 25–30% more calories per minute than other types of exercises, including weight training, cycling, and running on a treadmill.
That means HIIT can help you burn more calories while exercising less.
Numerous studies  have shown  that HIIT is especially effective at burning  belly fat , which  has links  to many chronic diseases.
To get started, choose a type of exercise, such as running, jumping, or biking, and your  exercise and rest times .
For example, pedal as hard as you can on a bike for 30 seconds, then pedal slowly for 1–2 minutes.  Repeat this pattern  for 10–30 minutes.

6. Swimming
The  American Council on Exercise  estimates that a 140-pound (65-kg) person burns about 9 calories per minute swimming at a crawl or moderate pace.
A 180-pound (81-kg) person burns about 11.6 calories per minute  swimming  at a crawl or moderate pace.
How you swim  appears to affect how many calories you burn.  One study  on competitive swimmers found that the most calories were burned during the breaststroke, followed by the butterfly, backstroke, and freestyle.
One  12-week study  in 24 middle-aged women found that swimming for 60 minutes 3 times per week significantly reduced body fat,  improved flexibility , and reduced several heart disease risk factors, including high  total cholesterol  and  blood triglycerides .
Swimming is its low impact nature, meaning it’s easier on your joints. This makes it a great option for people with  injuries or joint pain .

7. Yoga
While it’s not commonly considered a weight loss exercise, yoga burns a fair  amount of calories  and offers many additional  health benefits  that can promote weight loss.
A  12-week study  of 60 women with obesity found that those who participated in two 90-minute yoga sessions per week experienced greater reductions in waist circumference than those in the control group — by 1.5 inches (3.8 cm), on average.
The yoga group also experienced improvements in mental and physical well-being. In fact,  studies have shown  that yoga can teach  mindfulness  and reduce stress levels.
Most gyms offer yoga classes, but you can  practice yoga  anywhere. This includes from the comfort of your own home, as there are plenty of  guided tutorials  online.

8. Pilates
According to  a study sponsored by  the American Council on Exercise, a person weighing around 140 pounds (64 kg) would burn 108 calories at a 30-minute  beginner’s Pilates class  or 168 calories at an advanced class of the same duration.
Although Pilates may not burn  as many calories  as aerobic exercises like running, many people  find it enjoyable , which makes it easier to stick to over time.
An  8-week study  in 37 middle-aged women found that performing Pilates exercises for 90 minutes 3 times per week significantly reduced  waist, stomach, and hip circumference , compared with a control group that did no exercise over the same period.
Pilates may also  reduce  lower  back pain  and  improve  strength, balance, flexibility, endurance, and overall fitness.
You can do  Pilates at home  or at one of the many gyms that offer Pilates classes.
To further boost weight loss with Pilates, combine it with a  balanced diet  and other forms of exercise, such as weight training or cardio.

How much weight can you realistically expect to lose?
It’s important to remember that weight loss is not a linear process, and it’s common to find yourself losing weight more quickly when you first start.
How much weight you can  expect to lose  from exercise depends on your:
Starting weight:  People with a higher starting weight  typically have  a higher BMR. This is the number of calories your body burns when performing basic life-preserving functions. A high BMR means you will burn more calories during activity and rest.
Age:  Older people tend to carry more fat and less muscle mass, reducing their BMR. A lower BMR can make it  more difficult  to lose weight.
Sex:  People assigned female at birth (AFAB)  tend to have  a greater fat-to-muscle ratio than those assigned male (AMAB), which can affect BMR. As a result, AMAB individuals tend to lose weight quicker than AFAB folks, even if each group consumes a similar number of calories.
Diet:  Weight loss  occurs when  you burn more calories than you consume. Thus,  a calorie deficit  is essential to losing weight.
Sleep:  Studies have found that a lack of sleep  may slow  the rate at which you lose weight and  even increase  your cravings for high calorie foods.
Medical conditions : People with medical conditions like  depression  and  hypothyroidism  may lose weight at a  slower rate .
Genetics : Studies  have shown  that weight loss has a genetic component, which may affect certain people with obesity.
Although most people want to  lose weight quickly , experts often recommend losing  no more than  1–2 pounds (0.5–1.36 kg), or approximately 1% of your body weight, per week.
Losing weight too fast can have negative health consequences. It can  result in  muscle loss and increase your risk of:
gallstones
dehydration
fatigue
malnutrition
headaches
irritability
constipation
hair loss
irregular menstruation
People who  lose weight too fast  are also more prone to regaining it.

The bottom line
Some great choices for burning calories include walking, jogging, running, cycling, swimming, weight training, interval training, yoga, and Pilates.
Many other exercises can also help boost your weight loss efforts.
It’s most important to choose an exercise that you enjoy doing. This makes it more likely that you’ll stick to it long-term and see results.
