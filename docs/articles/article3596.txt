Title: How to Get Zepbound In Person and Online

Zepbound is the newest GLP-1 medication to be approved for weight loss. Find out who is eligible and how to get a prescription.
Prescription weight loss medications may be a useful tool for people looking to lose weight or maintain their weight loss when used in combination with a well-balanced diet and exercise routine.
In  November 2023 , the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Zepbound (tirzepatide) for long-term weight management. Tirzepatide has been approved for treating type 2 diabetes under the trade name Mounjaro since  May 2022 .
Zepbound is available through a prescription from a licensed medical professional for adults with obesity or overweight and at least one weight-related condition, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol.

How do you get Zepbound?
To obtain a prescription for Zepbound, you have two options: through an in-person visit with a doctor or through a  telehealth  consultation.
Just keep in mind that the process of obtaining medication isn’t always straightforward, even if you have a prescription.
There are significant shortages of GLP-1 weight loss medications due to manufacturers having difficulty meeting growing demand, which could be a concern for those interested in Zepbound.
Through a spokesperson, Eli Lilly addressed this issue.
“Today we are able to meet demand, but realize we will face challenges. We do our best to be prepared for any hurdles we might face,” Rhonda Pacheco, group vice president of U.S. Diabetes and Obesity at Eli Lilly, said in a statement.
“We are committed to doing all that we can to help meet demand, including making historic investments to enhance our manufacturing capability.”
For a comprehensive medical and physical exam, it’s best to make an in-person appointment with a licensed healthcare professional, such as a primary care physician, bariatric doctor, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant.
During your appointment, the healthcare professional reviews your medical history, discusses any health concerns, and assesses your weight loss goals to determine whether Zepbound is suitable for you. They may also request blood tests to evaluate your metabolism, organ health, and other factors.
If you qualify, the professional can prescribe Zepbound and guide any necessary lifestyle adjustments, like following a diet or exercise plan tailored to your needs.
Once you have a prescription, you can access Zepbound by visiting a retail pharmacy in person or ordering through a mail-order pharmacy.
If you’re unable to meet with a healthcare professional online, there are several reputable telehealth platforms to consider as well.
Just be cautious of any online service you’re not familiar with to avoid the risk of being sent counterfeit medications or falling for a financial scam.

What is Zepbound?
Zepbound  is a prescription  weight loss  drug manufactured by Eli Lilly. Users inject themselves with doses weekly.
The active ingredient in Zepbound is tirzepatide. It mimics the hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).
As a  GLP-1 agonist , it works by  slowing stomach emptying , increasing feelings of fullness, and reducing  glucagon  secretion, a hormone involved in blood sugar and appetite regulation.
Unlike some GLP-1 agonists, like  Ozempic  or Wegovy, Zepbound is also a GIP agonist. By activating this second hormone pathway, the medication may be even  more effective  for reducing food intake and supporting weight loss. However, research on whether dual GLP-1/GIP agonists are more effective than GLP-1 agonists is ongoing.
All the options below offer Zepbound for weight loss to eligible individuals. It’s ultimately up to a qualified healthcare professional to determine whether Zepbound is right for you.
Due to occasional  supply chain issues , Zepbound may be difficult to obtain.
Finally, because of  concerns around safety , the FDA doesn’t approve and warns against consuming  compounded  versions of injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist medications, including tirzepatide and semaglutide. It’s important to talk with a healthcare professional to ensure that you’re being prescribed noncompounded, FDA-approved GLP-1 medications.

Who can use it?
If you have obesity or overweight and want to lose weight, doctors may recommend trying Zepbound in combination with other lifestyle changes, such as following a well-balanced diet and exercise routine.
According to the  FDA , qualifying for this medication includes having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more or a BMI of 27 or more with at least one weight-related condition, such as:
high blood pressure
type 2 diabetes
heart disease
obstructive sleep apnea

Zepbound vs. Mounjaro
Zepbound and  Mounjaro  both contain the active ingredient tirzepatide.
The only difference between the two is that the FDA has approved Zepbound for weight loss and Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes.

Other approved weight loss drugs
In addition to Zepbound, the FDA has approved two other  GLP-1s  for weight loss: liraglutide, marketed as  Saxenda , and semaglutide, available as  Wegovy .
These prescription medications are part of the same class of drugs as Zepbound and work by affecting appetite and metabolism to promote weight loss.
A significant difference between these medications is their dosing schedule. Saxenda is typically administered once daily as a subcutaneous injection, while Wegovy is a weekly injection.
