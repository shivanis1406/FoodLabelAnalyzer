Title: 5 Best Eco-Friendly Meal Delivery Services

We tried some of the most sustainable meal delivery services, including Green Chef, Daily Harvest, and Splendid Spoon. Read on to see which other services made our list of top picks.
What you eat affects not only your health but also the environment.
In fact, a  2020 review of research  on different eating patterns suggested that more sustainable diet plans resulted in a greenhouse gas reduction of almost 26% compared with typical eating patterns.
However, it’s not always possible to plan, shop for, and cook sustainable meals at home.
Meal delivery services provide a convenient solution for busy weeknights by shipping boxes of ingredients or fully prepared meals right to your door.
But they also raise questions about sustainability, so we investigated some common meal delivery services to see which ones had the best sustainable practices. Here’s who won out.

Green Chef is a  certified organic meal kit company  that has a strong commitment to  reducing food waste  and uses eco-friendly packaging.

According to Green Chef’s  website , the company is the only meal kit service to offset 100% of its direct carbon emissions and plastic packaging.

All the packaging is recyclable, including the insulation, which is made from  ClimaCell , a starch-and-paper-based foam alternative that can be recycled curbside.
While our tester, Healthline editor Kelli McGrane, MS, RD, noted that her box came with both paper and plastic bags, she added, “I appreciated that each item included a note at the bottom on how to recycle it.”

The company also mentions that its meats are sourced from animals raised with high welfare standards, though there’s limited information on exactly where or how the animals are raised.
When it comes to flavor, McGrane said, “The Bulgogi Noodle Bowls was by far my favorite dish as the noodles had a wonderfully chewy texture and the flavors were spot-on. However, the other two dishes were also very flavorful and packed with fresh ingredients and vegetables.
“While some of the ingredient proportions were a bit off and the timing of some of the steps could’ve been better, I overall think this is one of the best meal delivery services thanks to the quality ingredients and flavorful dishes.”


Green Chef delivers preportioned ingredients and detailed recipe cards.


According to Green Chef’s website, most meals take about 30 minutes to prepare, making it a great choice if you enjoy cooking but are short on time.

Example meals include:
Southwest Turkey Stuffed Peppers
Blackened Salmon with Dijonnaise
Spicy Sriracha Tofu with Peanut Sauce


Keep in mind that ingredients are processed in a facility that handles common allergens. Green Chef isn’t ideal if you have severe food allergies.

According to its website, 95% of Daily Harvest’s ingredients are organic.

Additionally, the company works closely with farmers and suppliers to source good quality ingredients.

Currently, most but not all of the packaging is recyclable or compostable. However, the company is working toward 100% recyclable packaging.
Recently, Daily Harvest has partnered with non-profit organizations to help underserved farmers adopt organic and  regenerative farming practices .


While it’s best known for  smoothies , Daily Harvest also offers flatbreads, bowls, energy bites, soup, and even lattes.

Everything on the menu is vegan, gluten-free, and free of preservatives, additives, and fillers.

It’s important to note that while the meals don’t contain gluten, they are processed in a facility that processes other gluten-containing foods, so Daily Harvest may not be a suitable option if you have  celiac disease .
Everything ships frozen and can be stored in the freezer.

Note that you’ll need to use your own milk or broth to prepare the smoothies and soups. This may be a pro for some people because it allows you to customize your meals and snacks according to your dietary restrictions.

Prep time varies depending on the item, but meals can generally be prepared in just a few minutes.
Healthline contributor Rachael Link, MS, RD, tested Daily Harvest and called it “a convenient and time-saving way to round out your diet with more vegan-friendly, organic, and gluten-free snacks and meals.”
Still, she cautioned that some meals are lower in calories and not very filling.
“I think Daily Harvest could be a good fit for people interested in stocking their freezer with a few vegan and gluten-free snacks to enjoy between meals,” she said. “It could also be used as a supplement for a healthy diet or ordered to have some easy lunches on hand when you’re short on time.”

Example meals include:
Sweet Potato and Wild Rice Hash Bowl
Mint and  Cacao  Smoothie
Kabocha and Sage Flatbread
Green Chickpea and Turmeric Soup

Splendid Spoon prioritizes sourcing organic produce, particularly for items that are part of the Dirty Dozen list.

Furthermore, each meal includes a list stating which ingredients are organic or conventional.

Everything on the menu is plant-based and free from GMOs, gluten, soy, and added sugars. However, meals are processed in a facility that also processes allergens, so there’s a risk of cross contamination.
Splendid Spoon’s packaging is 100% recyclable. The company uses the same paper-and-starch-based ClimaCell insulation as Green Chef and uses dry ice instead of ice packs.


Splendid Spoon offers a large variety of plant-based, gluten-free, and non-GMO smoothies, grain bowls, soups, and noodle bowls.

While all the items are made without gluten, they’re produced in a facility that also processes gluten, so this won’t be an appropriate meal service if you have celiac disease.

Everything arrives fully prepared and frozen.
According to McGrane, “The smoothies are in narrow bottles that are easy to stack in your fridge and freezer. The noodle bowls, grain bowls, and soups, while not huge, were a bit bulky and more difficult to store in my already-packed freezer.”
She liked the noodle bowls best, praising the textures and flavors. She added, “The grain bowls were also nice in terms of texture and flavor, though I didn’t find them to be very filling.”

Example meals include:
Moroccan Spiced Buckwheat Bowl with Butternut Squash and Broccoli
Vegan Meatballs and Marinara Noodles
Orange Hibiscus Smoothie with Maqui Berries and Chia Seeds

You may recognize  Trifecta  from the Netflix documentary “ You Are What You Eat .”
This meal delivery service offers dietitian-designed, portion-controlled meals that are gluten-free, high in protein, and made with sustainable organic ingredients, including humanely raised meats and other proteins.
We’ve also named it our  best meal delivery service for weight loss . The meals contain about 350–500 calories and 20–40 grams of protein per serving and emphasize lean proteins, complex carbs, and veggies.
Most of them are also easy to log in popular nutrition apps, making this a great choice for those who are tracking their food intake.
Trifecta uses all  organic  produce and sources ingredients from suppliers with sustainable practices whenever possible, featuring humanely raised, grass-fed meat and sustainably sourced seafood.
Most of the packaging can be recycled, though the ice packs need to be drained first. The insulation is made from ClimaCell, which can be recycled curbside.

Trifecta meals come frozen. The company recommends heating them in an air fryer, on the stovetop, or in the oven.
Ajmera said, “This can be time-consuming, especially since they were all completely frozen and took quite some time to cook.”
Still, she added, “I think Trifecta would be worth considering for people who are new to cooking and looking for an easy way to enjoy more nutritious meals. It’s also great for specific diet patterns, including vegan or keto diets, so the service might be worthwhile for people who are interested in trying these diets but are unsure where to get started.”
Keep in mind that while you can choose your own meals (or have them chosen for you) within your plan, you can exclude no more than two ingredients per week, such as shellfish, mushrooms, soy, or salmon.
If you prefer putting together your own meals, there is also a Meal Prep option, which includes a variety of bulk proteins, carbs, and vegetables.


Example meals include:
Sweet & Sour Salmon with brown rice and pineapple
Turkey Burrito Bowl with roasted sweet potato
Tofu 2 Bean Chili with white rice

Martha Stewart & Marley Spoon is an eco-friendly option that’s great for families with its kid-friendly recipes and option for multiple servings.
The company’s shipping materials are either reusable or recyclable, but the gel filling needs to be discarded from the ice packs before you can recycle them.
Marley Spoon is also carbon-neutral, according to  ClimatePartner , and the company’s website claims that it reduced its carbon emissions by  25%  in 2022 as compared to 2020.
The company sources seasonal and local veggies, though they aren’t organic.
How it works
Each week, Marley Spoon offers a rotating menu with more than 100 recipes, and you can choose which ones you’d like to include in your shipment. Most recipes are dinner entrees, but the company will at times have side dishes, desserts, breakfasts, and holiday foods to choose from as well.
You can also opt to include extra proteins, such as chicken, shrimp, and salmon, in your order.
McGrane called this service “highly underrated.” She said, “While the process of selecting meals could be more streamlined (I’d love a filtering option), there’s a good variety of meals to choose from, and the prices are competitive with similar services.”
She tried three recipes. “As written, all three recipes were designed for easy cleanup, which is a big plus in my book. The recipes were designed to feed two. However, after feeding myself, my husband, and my 20-month-old, we still had leftovers for each dish.”
Example meals include:
Fast! Za’atar Steak
Herb-Roasted Salmon
Loaded Turkey Burrito Bowl

How we chose the best sustainable meal delivery services
With so many meal delivery services available, you may be wondering which is the best for the environment.
We researched the best eco-friendly meal delivery services based on the following criteria:
Using a meal delivery service usually means you’ll be faced with lots of trash and recycling each week. Some of this is unavoidable (for example, meats usually need to be packaged in plastic to avoid leakage). But some services are better than others when it comes to waste.
We looked for services that prioritize recyclable, reusable, or compostable packaging. We also considered services that use alternative insulation and cooling materials.
Eating sustainably also means considering ingredient sources. We included services that offer plant-based meals or meats that are sourced in more sustainable ways. We also prioritized services with organic and seasonal ingredients.
We were careful not to compromise flavor when making our list. We personally tested each service and looked for ones that we thought would suit a variety of dietary needs and preferences.

Comparing sustainable meal delivery services

Are meal delivery services actually sustainable?
While it may be surprising, many meal delivery services offer a more  sustainable way to eat .
For example, because they deliver either fully prepared meals or the exact amounts of ingredients needed, meal delivery services can help cut back on food waste.
Many also prioritize organic ingredients, which are grown using more sustainable farming practices, as well as seasonal produce, sustainable meats and fish, and  eco-friendly packaging .
On the other hand, these services tend to contribute quite a bit of trash, as each ingredient is often packaged individually and the packaging may not always be recyclable.
Still,  one study from 2019  found that, compared with grocery store meals, meal kits create less food waste and have lower last-mile logistics emissions (those related to the transportation of goods from their hub to their final destination), contributing 33% less greenhouse gas emissions.
Of course, some meal delivery services are more sustainable than others.
Additionally, there are lots of ways that you can become a  more sustainable eater , with or without a meal delivery service, including:
choosing  local  whenever possible
eating more plant-based meals
reducing food waste by buying only what you will use
growing your own food
reducing the use of plastic and materials that are not recyclable
composting  food scraps and leftovers

Frequently asked questions about sustainable meal delivery
Sustainability comes from limiting waste from both food ingredients and packaging. A more sustainable meal might use just the right amount of ingredients that are produced using sustainable practices and, ideally, sourced from as nearby as possible. It would also be delivered in reusable or recyclable packaging.

How you dispose of eco-friendly packaging will depend on the materials it’s made of and where you live.
Be sure to check the website of the meal delivery service you order from, which will include instructions for disposing of the packaging. This is especially important for materials such as cold packs used to keep your food fresh or frozen. These often need to be thawed and drained before you dispose of them.
When it comes to recycling, some communities have curbside recycling programs, while others may require you to bring the packages to your local recycling center.

It depends on the company you order from.
The increase in food delivery has led to increases in carbon emissions, mostly due to the use of packaging. Researchers expect to see the number of food delivery orders increase to 65 million in 2024, which could lead to a  132% rise in carbon emissions .
Still, there isn’t data specific to meal delivery services and their total waste.
If you want to choose a more sustainable meal delivery service, look for one that uses local, organic ingredients; offers plant-based meals; and prioritizes recyclable and compostable packaging.

If you’re new to using a meal delivery service, there are a few things to keep in mind.
Depending on how many meals you choose to receive, you may still need to plan other meals for the week, as well as other items such as beverages and snacks.
This also means you’ll want to budget for both your meal delivery and any other groceries you’ll need for the week.
If you’ve chosen a meal delivery that includes prepared meals, you’ll want to read instructions for how to store and heat the food.
Alternatively, if you’ll be preparing the meals yourself, be sure to review the recipes ahead of time. That way, you can plan your prep time accordingly and ensure that you have the right cookware and tools.

Using a meal delivery service can be a great way to reduce food waste and help decrease your carbon footprint.

Lastly, be sure to consider your budget, dietary restrictions and preferences, and the amount of time you’re willing to spend in the kitchen.
