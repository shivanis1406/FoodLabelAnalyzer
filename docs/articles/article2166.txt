Title: 17 Healthy No-Prep Recipes for the Days When You Just Can’t

It’s understandable if making elaborate (and delicious! and healthy!) meals is the last thing on your mind.
Whatever your situation, by the time 5 p.m. rolls around, there may be plenty of days when you just can’t muster the oomph for a healthy, home-cooked dinner.
I’m right there with you.
As a work-from-home parent with three kids, I’m not always leaping up from my laptop to prepare our evening meals.
But as a nutritionist, it’s still important to me that our meals be healthy and nourishing.
Through some trial and error, I’ve found that many minimal-work, done-in-a-flash recipes  can  actually feed us well.
Here’s everything you need to know about short-cutting your way to healthy, no-prep dinners.

Stock up
Pulling together healthy meals on the fly won’t happen without a  little  thinking ahead — mainly in the form of intentional grocery shopping.
Stock up on these convenient go-tos to set yourself up for no-prep meal success.

rotisserie chicken
turkey or fish burgers

Once you’ve got these ingredients on hand, you’re ready to try the 17 delicious meals below. Whether you’re looking for salads, soups, or mains, I’ve got you covered.

Salads

Full disclosure: You  will  have to do a little bit of chopping for this salad, but it’ll be worth it when you get a perfect bite with creamy avocado and juicy tomato.
Use a bag of presliced romaine to make things even easier. And when you’re really not feelin’ it at dinnertime, skip the homemade dressing in favor of an olive oil-based bottled variety.

Soups
The directions for this intriguingly flavored chilled soup couldn’t be simpler: Put all ingredients in a blender. Blend until smooth. I’ll sip to that!

If you’ve yet to explore the wide world of sheet pan dinners, now’s the time. I like to think of these easy dinners as “chop, plop, and pop.”

Get ahead of the dinner game by dumping a few ingredients in your slow cooker around lunchtime. You’ll be well on your way to an aromatic, home-cooked meal come evening.

Last word
When tough days get you down, there’s nothing wrong with the occasional takeout meal. But like many quick fixes, takeout on repeat isn’t a very sustainable solution.
Instead, fill your pantry and fridge with the building blocks of no-prep meals. Do it for your health, your wallet, and your stress level.
