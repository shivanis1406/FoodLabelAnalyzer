Title: 13 Low Fat Foods That Are Good For Your Health

Many low fat foods, such as leafy greens, fruits, and legumes, are rich in vitamins, minerals, protein, and antioxidants. Some have also been associated with health benefits and a reduced risk of chronic disease.
Restricting your fat intake is generally unnecessary if you’re following a healthy, balanced diet.
However, under certain circumstances, limiting the amount of fat in your diet may be beneficial.
For example, low fat diets are recommended if you’re  recovering from  gallbladder surgery, trying to  prevent  heartburn, or  improving  cholesterol levels.
Here are 13 low fat foods that are good for your health.

1. Leafy greens
Leafy greens, such as  kale ,  collards , and  spinach , contain virtually no fat and are loaded with beneficial minerals and vitamins, including:
calcium
potassium
folate
vitamin A
vitamin K
They’re especially  rich in  certain plant compounds shown to  reduce inflammation  in your body.
Not surprisingly, studies suggest that diets high in leafy greens may protect against certain conditions like  heart disease ,  diabetes , and  cancer .
Common leafy greens include:
kale
spinach
arugula
collard greens
Swiss chard
romaine lettuce
Fresh  leafy greens  can be added to salads or smoothies. For a wholesome side dish, try steaming or sautéing them with your favorite herbs and spices.
Leafy greens contain virtually no fat and plenty of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Research suggests that diets rich in leafy greens may prevent conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.

2. Fruits
Fruits  are an excellent option if you’re looking for a sweet, low fat snack. Almost all fruits are low in fat and high in vitamins, minerals, and  fiber .
They’re also particularly rich in plant compounds. In fact,  many of  these beneficial plant compounds are responsible for fruits’ vibrant colors.
In addition, certain plant compounds are known to be potent  antioxidants .
In your body, antioxidants guard against harmful, unstable molecules known as free radicals. Cellular damage from free radicals is  linked to  aging, heart disease,  arthritis ,  cancer , and other conditions.
Fortunately, many studies suggest that diets high in fruits and vegetables  can reduce  free radical damage due to their high antioxidant content .
Fruits can be enjoyed fresh, dried, or cooked. Try adding them to  smoothies  and salads or eating them with various dips.
Fruits are sweet, low fat foods loaded with antioxidants, which protect your cells against free radical damage.

3. Beans and legumes
Legumes  — also known as pulses — are a class of vegetables that includes  beans ,  peas , and  lentils .
They’re low in fat and  contain no  cholesterol. What’s more, they’re high in:
fiber
protein
B vitamins
magnesium
zinc
iron
Due to their highly nutritious profile, beans and legumes offer several health benefits.
Research also shows that they may reduce  blood pressure  and  cholesterol , as well as manage  blood sugar  levels.
Additionally, regular consumption of beans and legumes  may help  manage weight and aid weight loss, as the high amounts of fiber can keep you feeling fuller longer.
Beans and legumes are low in fat and packed with protein and fiber. Research shows that diets high in beans and legumes may reduce blood pressure and cholesterol, as well as aid weight loss and blood sugar management.

4. Sweet potatoes
The  sweet potato  is a hearty, low fat  root vegetable . In fact, one medium sweet potato only contains roughly  0.1 grams (g)  of fat.
Besides being low in fat, sweet potatoes provide several vitamins and minerals including:
vitamin A
vitamin C
B vitamins
potassium
manganese
Their bright orange color is due to high amounts of  beta-carotene , a plant pigment  known to  protect against the cell damage caused by free radicals.
Beta-carotene appears particularly beneficial for your eyes.  Research  suggests that diets high in beta-carotene are associated with a reduced risk of  eye conditions  like cataracts and  age-related macular degeneration (AMD) .
The sweet potato is a low fat root vegetable packed with vitamins A and C. It’s also high in beta-carotene, an antioxidant which may reduce your risk of certain eye conditions.

5. Tart cherry juice
Tart cherries , also known as sour or Montmorency cherries, are fat-free fruits rich in anti-inflammatory compounds called  polyphenols .
Tart cherries  may have  mental health benefits. They support an anti-fatiguing effect during periods of high cognitive demand, which is beneficial for daily tasks requiring vigilance.
They may also be beneficial for reducing blood levels of  uric acid , a chemical that can trigger  gout  when present at high levels in the blood. Interestingly,  studies  have shown a link between cherry intake and a reduced risk of gout flare-ups.
Tart cherries and their juice are fat-free and rich in plant compounds called polyphenols. This fruit may support cognitive function and could also be beneficial for gout.

6. Cruciferous vegetables
Cruciferous vegetables  are a robust  source of  nutrients, including fiber,  folate , and other minerals, as well as  vitamins C , E, and K.
Some common cruciferous vegetables include:
broccoli
cauliflower
Brussels sprouts
cabbage
bok choy
turnips
All of these vegetables have virtually no fat, making them an excellent addition to a low fat diet.
Alongside their nutrients, cruciferous vegetables provide sulfur-containing substances known as glucosinolates, which are responsible for the vegetables’ bitter flavor.
Glucosinolates  have demonstrated  anticancer effects in test-tube and animal studies.
Many observational studies in humans also link high consumption of cruciferous vegetables to a reduced risk of several cancers, including:
bladder cancer
breast cancer
colon cancer
lung cancer
stomach cancer
Keep in mind that cooking methods can affect the number of glucosinolates available in cruciferous vegetables. You  may absorb  the most glucosinolates if you eat these vegetables raw, steamed, or sautéed instead of boiled.
Cruciferous vegetables are low in fat and high in sulfur-containing substances known as glucosinolates, which may have anti-cancer effects.

7. Mushrooms
Mushrooms  are a delicious, fat-free food with many purported health benefits.
Interestingly, they don’t fall into any of the traditional food groups — they’re neither a fruit nor vegetable, grain, or animal product.
In fact, mushrooms are fungi  used widely  as food and medicine for centuries.
Common edible types of mushrooms include:
white button
crimini
portobello
shiitake
oyster
Mushrooms’ nutrients vary by type, but all contain potassium, fiber, and various B vitamins and minerals. Certain types also contain a significant amount of  vitamin D .

Throughout history, garlic has been  used for  medicinal purposes.
Some  older research shows that garlic may enhance your immune system and help protect against the  common cold  when consumed regularly. However,  most studies  have used supplements containing garlic extract, so it’s unclear whether consuming garlic as part of your diet could have the same effects.
Some studies also link the active compounds in garlic to  reduced  blood pressure and  lowered  cholesterol, though high amounts of garlic or concentrated supplements are needed to have an effect.
Garlic is commonly used in cooking and for medicinal purposes. Research suggests that the active compounds in garlic may help enhance your immune system and reduce blood pressure and cholesterol.

9. Ancient grains
Ancient grains  are loosely  defined as  grains that have gone mostly unaltered for the past several hundred years, unlike more modern grains, such as wheat and corn.
Some popular ancient grains include:
farro
spelt
quinoa
Though each grain has a unique nutritional profile, they’re all low in fat and packed with nutrients, such as:
protein
fiber
