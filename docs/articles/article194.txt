Why we like it:  Trifecta Nutrition earns our vote for best meal delivery services for weight loss overall, as it provides calorie- and portion-controlled dishes that are  macro-balanced  to help you meet your protein, carb, and fat content goals.
How it works:  Meals are fully prepared and contain around 350 to 500 calories and 20 to 40 grams of protein per serving. Plus, each dish features lean proteins, complex carbs, and vegetables.
Most diet meal delivery plans are featured on popular  nutrition apps , so you can easily track your intake. Trifecta also has an app that can help you track your meals, workouts, and more.
Each week, you can order 7 to 28 entrees, either with or without breakfast. You can choose your own meals or opt for a preselected menu and exclude one ingredient per week, such as shellfish, mushrooms, or poultry.
“Trifecta’s meals are tasty, filling, and nutritious.
“They arrived frozen and were shipped and packaged well.  [The meals]  require a bit more preparation than some other similar services — they needed to be reheated on the stove — but they are generally very easy to make and may help save time on cooking.
“They  were pretty tasty and maintained their texture for the most part. A  few required additional ingredients, such as spices or veggies, to make them more palatable. Some also included large amounts of spinach, which became slimy after reheating.
“I think [Trifecta] is worthwhile for people who adventurous eaters, athletes, people with a busy schedule, and those following vegan, paleo, or keto diet plans.”

Why we like it:  Factor is a meal subscription service that delivers nutrient-rich,  fully prepared meals  straight to your door. It also offers individual support from a registered dietitian, which can  help foster  health-promoting eating habits to support long-term weight management.
During testing, Factor scored highly for meal variety, nutrition quality, ingredient quality, ease of preparation, and taste.
How it works:  Factor meals generally contain 350 to 900 calories per serving. However, its Calorie Smart meal plan offers tasty meals with fewer than 550 calories per serving to help you stay within your  calorie deficit  goals. A sampling of recent items included Mushroom Chicken Thighs & Wild Rice, Garlic Butter Shrimp and Creamed Kale, and Sun-dried Tomato Spinach Fusilli.
Detailed nutritional information is available for each item. Some meals can also be found on popular nutrition tracking apps, such as MyFitnessPal.
“The meals I tried from Factor had great flavors and textures, even after reheating. Each meal contained a good serving of vegetables, and the chicken and fish were nicely cooked.”
—  Kelli McGrane , MS, RD, Healthline contributor
Healthline Editor Kristin Currin-Sheehan tried Factor’s Keto diet “I’ve seen advertisements about how filling Factor is and so the protein plus cuisine appealed to me as a potential 2-for-1 solution for my chronic inflammation and  weight loss .”

What we like about it:  CookUnity provides meals designed and cooked by regional chefs that cater to different dietary needs and preferences, including lower calorie options that come in under 600 calories. It’s also one of the tastiest meal plans we’ve tried.
However, entrees outside the low calorie options can be quite high in calories and saturated fat, so if you’re looking for prepared meals to  lose weight, you’ll want to make sure you’re using that filter.
Our tester noted that some meals had less vegetables than she anticipated, so you might want to keep a salad kit or some frozen vegetables on hand to round out your meal.
How it works:  You can filter the menu to find specific types of meals, such as meals that are under 600 calories, that are  low in carbs  or low sodium. Plus, you can filter meals by protein type and dietary restrictions.
Select items can be found on nutrition tracking apps, such as MyFitnessPal.

What we like about it:  BistroMD is a doctor-designed meal delivery service that specializes in prepared meals to  lose weight  and other health concerns, including diabetes and heart disease. We like that the program customizes a week’s worth of nutritionally balanced meals based on your goals and food preferences.
How it works:  BistroMD allows you to customize your weekly meal plan by selecting from 150 meals, each of which can be reheated and enjoyed.
However, the meals are very low in calories. The meal plans are based on 1,200 calories per day for females and 1,400 calories per day for males. Snacks are available as add-ons and contain roughly 150 calories each. This may not be enough calories for some people.
All plans are  high in protein , which has  been shown  to help reduce body weight, fat mass, and appetite.
The service also includes the option to receive email support from a registered dietitian in addition to free webinars and articles.
“There are a wide variety of meals available, so you can really pick what you’re in the mood for, including everything from savory meals to sweet snacks and shakes.
“Each meal was prepared quickly and was very filling. Because there was just the right amount, I always finished it and didn’t have that “I ate too much” feeling afterward.
“Each meal had a good variety of flavors, veggies, and proteins.
“The taste and texture of the meals were also very good, which was surprising considering they were shipped and reheated in the microwave. I was impressed with their bold flavors, like BBQ salmon, that could have gone really wrong in the microwave but still tasted pretty good.
“The only issue — like you would find in a lot of microwave meals — is the small pool of trapped moisture you almost always find when warming up food. Not a huge deal, but was a little unappetizing when something like green beans would sit and absorb liquid if you didn’t eat it fast enough.
“Overall, I felt I didn’t need to add anything else. Especially with the snacks and shakes, I always had a full meal, even if I didn’t like something on the plate.”

Meal type   meal kits and prepared meals
What we like about it:  Purple Carrot is a  plant-based meal delivery service  offering nutrient-rich vegan meals and meal kits with creative flavor combinations.  Studies  suggest switching to a vegetarian diet may aid  weight loss .
Healthline Nutrition Editor Kelli McGrane, MS, RD, particularly liked how creative the recipes were compared with other meal delivery services. She also liked the generous servings of vegetables in each dish.
The meal kit recipes aren’t the most beginner-friendly, however, and can take up to 50 minutes to prepare.
How it works:  Meal options change weekly, and customers can choose the meals they wish to receive, including a mixture of prepared meals and vegetarian meal kits. You can also select specific meal preferences such as High Protein, Gluten-Free, and Less Prep.
On average, meals contain 500 to 800 calories per serving. However, Purple Carrot also labels most items that contain fewer than 600 calories per serving, which can be useful if you’re looking for lower calorie options.
If you choose to receive the meal kits, your ingredients will come pre-measured and in labeled packaging. Purple Carrot also includes a recipe booklet with easy-to-follow instructions, although some people, like our tester, may prefer one of the larger-print recipe cards.
Our tester noted that most meals are straightforward to prepare and don’t require a using stack of dishes to clean afterward.

“I found that Purple Carrot’s recipes were the most unique [of other plant-based meal kits]. I enjoyed the flavors and textures of each dish I tried and loved that the service introduced me to new ingredients, or uses for ingredients, and flavor combinations.”  — Kelli McGrane, Healthline contributor
A few meals in particular stood out:
New England “lobster” Rolls:  “A creative twist on a classic dish. Used   heart of palm  in place of lobster meat. As someone who has eaten their fair share of lobster rolls, I was pleasantly surprised at how the flavor and texture hit all the right notes — just what you’d expect from this New England staple.”
Romesco Grain Bowls:  “Included pan-roasted mushrooms and butter beans. Again, I found the dish to be brimming with flavor, and I appreciated the variation in textures.”
Spicy Almond Butter Noodles:  “LOVED the sauce and the texture of the whole wheat ramen was awesome (super chewy). I also liked the bok choy as I don’t buy it often. My only complaint was that the textures felt a bit repetitive after a while, and I wished that there was tofu for an extra protein boost.”

What we like about it:  Splendid Spoon offers a broad selection of plant-based, ready-made meals, including smoothies, soups, noodle bowls, and grain bowls. Most entrees are also under 500 calories, which may be helpful for people trying to reduce their calorie intake to support weight loss.
Our tester really appreciated that the smoothies weren’t overly sweet and featured ingredients that she wouldn’t typically add, though she didn’t love the consistency of some smoothies.
How it works:  Each week, you can mix and match your favorite items to create a custom box. For people trying to lose weight, most Splendid Spoon options are fewer than 500 calories, which can help support weight loss goals.

While the menu is gluten-free, foods are produced in a facility that also processes gluten, which may not be suitable for people with a severe allergy or sensitivity to gluten.

“[The noodle bowls] included generous amounts of vegetables and featured flavor-filled sauces that aligned with my food preferences.”

What we like about it:  We recommend Sunbasket’s meal kits for people who are trying to lose weight because it offers several menus that may support weight management, including  keto -friendly,  Mediterranean ,  carb-conscious , and  vegetarian  plans.
During testing, the service scored highly for its meal variety, nutrition and ingredient quality, ease of preparation, and taste. In fact, it earned our pick as  best overall meal delivery service .
How it works:  Sunbasket is a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) certified organic meal delivery service with a wide variety of nutritious meal kits.
In addition to choosing meals based on dietary patterns that may support weight loss, you can filter the menu to only view meals that contain fewer than 600 calories. This may be particularly helpful if you’re trying to reduce your calorie intake.
Meals include detailed nutritional information, and some can also be found on nutrition tracking apps.
“Out of all of the meal kit delivery services I’ve tried, Sunbasket’s ingredients tasted the freshest, and I thought the quality of the meat and seafood was noteworthy,”
“The meals featured interesting flavor combinations, and I appreciated that the recipes included lots of vegetables.”

What we like about it:  Territory Foods offers seasonal, chef-prepared meals for a variety of eating patterns. You can filter for fewer than 500 calories, allowing you to quickly find a large selection of meals that can support your weight loss goals.
Our tester gave Territory high marks for meal variety, nutrition quality, sustainability efforts, ease of preparation, and taste. It also scored well for ingredient quality.
The biggest downside? The price.
Still, if it fits within your budget, this meal delivery service might be one to consider to support your weight loss goals.
How it works:  When selecting your meals, you use the filter the menu to view dishes that are fewer than 500 calories per serving. Detailed information on the nutritional content of each meal is available online, along with a breakdown of the  macronutrient ratios  in each serving.
Territory Foods chefs work in independent kitchens around the country and use locally sourced ingredients as well as humanely raised poultry, grass-fed beef, and sustainably sourced seafood. All meals are free of gluten, dairy, and refined sugar.
“I would recommend Territory Foods,” Abellon said. “I think [it could be] especially helpful for individuals or couples, both those living on their own or who might have different needs for their diet than the rest of their household.
“The flavors were really good. It was a good level of salt for me, and I liked the combination and balance of ingredients.”

What we like about it:  Mosaic Foods is a plant-based meal delivery service that provides an assortment of prepared individual and family-friendly  frozen meals . Most of the meals have fewer than 500 calories per serving, which can help support weight loss goals. And the taste of the meals and the nutrition profile pack a punch.
One downside to Mosaics meals may be the cooking time: Mosaic recommends using the oven to reheat some of its meals (some can be microwaved), which can take more than 75 minutes.

How it works:  The company has a large menu with more than 50 items to choose from, including an array of pizzas, oat bowls, and veggie bowls. Mosaic also offers a line of oven-ready family meals, which include four servings each.

Most of Mosaic’s meals contain fewer than 500 calories per serving, making it a good option for individuals looking for lower calorie options.

The company provides detailed information on the nutritional value of each dish and labels items that are high in protein, vegan-friendly, or free of specific allergens.

“Mosaic’s Family Meals were a hit in my household. While my husband and son loved the flavors and textures, I appreciated the plant-forward and nutritionally dense ingredients.
“My meals arrived on time and in good condition. While they aren’t large boxes, depending on how many you order, they can take up a decent amount of freezer space.
“The ingredients seemed to be good quality. My biggest gripe is that everything tasted just a little watery, especially the tofu and vegetables, which I think is due to the meals being frozen. The exceptions were the pizzas, which tasted like very good frozen pizzas.
“The pizzas were also interesting in that they’re two servings each. However, once I started eating them I fully understood why: they are VERY rich (in a good way) and I did find that I had about 1/3 of a pizza left to munch on the next day.
“As for flavors, all of the dishes I tried were very flavorful, though the flavors didn’t always match my expectation. I definitely wasn’t concerned about needing more vegetables. However, a few meals did need a little flavor boost from hot sauce, soy sauce, and/or lime juice.
“While it isn’t my favorite plant-based meal delivery, I do think [Mosaic] is a solid option for people who want to keep a stash of healthy frozen meals on hand.”

“Mosaic’s Family Meals were a hit in my household. While my husband and son loved the flavors and textures, I appreciated the plant-forward and nutritionally dense ingredients.
“My meals arrived on time and in good condition. While they aren’t large boxes, depending on how many you order, they can take up a decent amount of freezer space.

How we test meal kits
At Healthline, we know that meal delivery services are a significant investment, which is why we’ve taken the time to test more than 30 of the most popular meal delivery services on the market.
Testers select a week’s worth of meals from multiple menus to get a well-rounded view of the types of flavors and ingredients offered.
During testing, we consider several factors, including the ease of signing up and choosing meals, the variety and nutritional composition of the meals offered, ingredient quality and freshness, ease of cooking, and, of course, the taste.
You can learn more about  our testing process .
Our  experts  have carefully researched and  vetted  over 70 meal delivery services, evaluated products from more than 65 different meal delivery brands, and tested 35+ meal delivery services.
In addition to the nine services that made our list of favorites, we also considered and tried Green Chef, Blue Apron, Daily Harvest, Diet-to-Go, and Epicured. However, we thought our nine favorites offered the best value for money, most variety, and most complete nutritional profile for weight loss.
We’ve made sure everything we feature meets our standards. We fact-checked health claims, evaluated ingredients, and looked into each brand’s reputation before sharing products on Healthline.

Can you lose weight with a meal delivery service?
If you’re looking to lose weight, meal delivery services can be strategic allies for several reasons, including:
Set portion sizes:  Meal delivery services offer pre-portioned meals with a fixed and known total calorie and macronutrient content.  Portion sizes  are  directly linked  to energy intake, so reducing them  can be helpful  for creating a calorie deficit to support weight loss.
Adherence:  Whether you lack the time or resources, following a diet can be difficult because it requires careful meal planning. Meal delivery services can make adhering to diets like the Mediterranean diet or  keto  easier by delivering diet-compliant meals or meal kits directly to your door.
Improved diet quality:  Depending on the recipe, meal delivery services can provide meals that are more nutritious than what you might typically eat. In particular, these meals can provide lean proteins and good sources of fiber, like vegetables, to  help keep  you full. Protein is also important for preserving muscle mass.
What’s more, research shows that exposure to greater healthy food variety — which is the case with most meal delivery services — can increase the intake of low calorie, energy-dense foods like fruits and vegetables,  helping support  and sustain weight loss.

What to look for in a meal delivery service for weight loss
Price:  Make sure to choose the meal delivery service that best fits your weekly or monthly food or grocery budget. Don’t forget to consider shipping costs and whether you’ll have to shop for additional meals or foods.
High quality ingredients:  Look for services that prioritize fresh ingredients and use little or no artificial additives or heavily processed ingredients. Some people may also prefer a service that offers organic produce, sustainable seafood, or  grass-fed beef .
Nutritional information:  Look for services that offer nutritionally balanced meals or disclose each meal’s nutritional information. That way, you’ll better understand your calorie and macro intake.
App compatibility:  If you use an app to keep track of your calories or macros, it can be helpful to choose a service with meals already entered into your app.
Variety:  Look for alternatives that offer a varied menu, which can help prevent you from getting bored with their dishes. It’s also important that they accommodate your specific diet, be it omnivorous, vegan, gluten-free,  low carb , etc.
Convenience:  Whether you have time to do a little cooking or just have a few minutes to warm up and eat, choose an option that meets your convenience needs. This can help you avoid wasting food and time.
