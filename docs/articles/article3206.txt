Title: The 14 Best Healthy Late Night Snacks

A nutritious late night snack, such as fruit, eggs, or edamame, may provide health benefits. Some foods contain compounds that might even help you sleep better.
There is growing scientific evidence that eating too late at night could make it harder to manage your weight. But if you’re truly hungry, a small, nutrient-rich snack with less than 200 calories is generally fine at night.
Some snacks even contain compounds that might help you sleep better.
Here are 14 excellent and healthy late night snack ideas.

1. Tart cherries
Add tart  cherries , such as Montmorency, or their juice to your late night snack options.
A  few older studies  suggest that they may help you sleep better. Moreover,  they have anti-inflammatory benefits  and may protect against inflammation-related conditions such as arthritis and heart disease.
Tart cherries contain a relatively small amount of the sleep-promoting hormone  melatonin .
However, they also contain the phytochemical procyanidin B-2. This compound is thought to  protect  the amino acid tryptophan in your blood, which your body uses to make melatonin.
An 8-ounce (oz), or 240-milliliter (mL), glass of 100% tart cherry juice contains  159 calories , while 1/4 cup, or 40 grams (g), of dried tart cherries has  133 calories .
Tart cherries or their juice can make an ideal late night snack since studies suggest they may help you sleep better. Eight ounces (240 mL) of 100% tart cherry juice or 1/4 cup (40 g) of dried tart cherries has less than 160 calories.

2. Banana with almond butter
One  small   banana  and 1 tablespoon (tbsp), or 16 g, of unsweetened  almond butter  is a tasty 190-calorie pairing that may help you sleep.
Bananas  are one of the few fruits known to be relatively rich in the nerve messenger serotonin, some of which your body converts to melatonin.
Almonds  and almond butter supply some melatonin. They’re also  a good source  of healthy fats, vitamin E, and magnesium.
Snacking on a banana with almond butter may help increase your body’s melatonin levels to support a good night’s sleep — and for only about 190 calories.

3. Kiwi
This  fuzzy-skinned , sweet-tart fruit is nutritious and low in calories.
Two kiwi fruits contain  84 calories , 4 g of fiber, and 142% of the daily value (DV) of vitamin C.
In addition, kiwis may help you sleep better.
In a  small 2023 study , researchers tested the effect of kiwi fruit on sleep in 15 elite athletes. For 4 weeks, each participant ate two kiwi fruits before bed and monitored their sleep in a diary. Participants experience improved sleep and a reduction in waking up after going to sleep.
Kiwis are among the few fruits that  contain a good amount  of the nerve messenger serotonin. Serotonin has a relaxing effect and can help you fall asleep faster. It also helps curb carb cravings.
Though larger studies are needed to confirm the sleep benefits of kiwi, there are plenty of other reasons to enjoy this fruit in the meantime.
Kiwis are a light, satisfying snack that’s rich in vitamin C. Two peeled kiwis have only 84 calories. They’re also a natural source of serotonin, which promotes relaxation and helps curb appetite.

4. Protein smoothie
Eating a  protein-rich snack  before bed could  support muscle repair  and help slow down age-related muscle loss, particularly if you exercise routinely.
Smoothies are an easy and tasty way to sneak in protein-rich milk before bed.
For example, you can blend 8 oz ( 240 mL ) of low fat milk with 2/3 cup (110 g) of frozen  pineapple  for a tropical treat with only  160 calories .
What’s more, milk is rich in  tryptophan , an amino acid that your body uses to make serotonin and melatonin, which  aid sleep .
A milk-based smoothie supplies protein, which contributes to muscle repair, and tryptophan, which your body uses to make sleep-promoting brain chemicals. An 8-oz (240-mL) smoothie with low fat milk and pineapple has only about 160 calories.

5. Goji berries
The red-orange color of these sweet-tart berries hints at their  rich supply of antioxidants  such as carotenoids.
In an older, preliminary 2-week study in 2008, participants drank 4 oz (120 mL) of goji berry juice or a placebo beverage each day.
More than  80% of people  in the goji berry group reported improved sleep quality. About 70% found it easier to wake up, and around 50% reported feeling less tired. People in the placebo group reported no such benefits.
More extensive and rigorous studies are needed to further explore these sleep benefits, but goji berries are a simple, nutrient-rich snack, in any case.
A 5-tbsp (28-g) serving of dried goji berries has  98 calories . You can eat them out of hand like raisins or add them to trail mix or cereal.
Goji berries are an antioxidant-rich snack that may promote good sleep. A 5-tbsp serving of these tasty dried berries has 98 calories.

6. Crackers and cheese
Snacks that balance carbohydrates and protein, such as whole grain crackers and cheese,  support  consistent blood sugar levels.
From a sleep perspective, combining carb-rich foods like crackers with good tryptophan sources like cheese helps make tryptophan more available to your brain.
This means your body can use the compound to make serotonin and melatonin, which  aid sleep .
A serving of 4 whole wheat crackers ( 16 g ) and one stick of reduced fat cheddar cheese ( 28 g ) has around 145 calories.
The combo of protein from cheese and carbs from crackers supports steady blood sugar levels and the production of sleep-supporting brain chemicals. What’s more, 4 crackers and 1 stick (28 g) of reduced fat cheese have only about 150 calories.

7. Hot cereal
Hot cereal isn’t just for breakfast — it’s also a great way to wind down at night.
Whole grain cereals such as  oatmeal  are good sources of fiber and are generally more nutrient-dense than ready-to-eat breakfast cereals.
You can also think outside the box and turn cooked barley or whole grain rice into hot cereal by adding milk and toppings such as  cinnamon , nuts, or dried fruit.
You can prepare whole grains that require longer cooking times in advance and store them in your fridge for a few days. Add some water and reheat the grains when you’re ready for a late night snack.
A 3/4-cup (175-g) serving of cooked oatmeal made with water averages  124 calories . You can stir in 1/4 cup (61 g) of nonfat Greek yogurt for protein and an additional  37 calories .
Just about any cooked whole grain can be combined with milk or other toppings for a healthy late night snack. A 3/4-cup (175-g) serving of cooked oatmeal made with water has only 124 calories.

8. Trail mix
You can buy trail mix premade or purchase your favorite ingredients individually and make your own.
Dried fruits ,  nuts , and seeds are typical healthy choices. Mix them and portion out about 1/4 cup (38 g) at a time into snack-size bags or reusable containers.
Since trail mix ingredients are generally calorie-dense, it’s important to watch your portion size. A 1/4-cup (38-g) serving of trail mix averages  173 calories .
Besides supplying healthy fats, B vitamins, and minerals, certain trail mix add-ins may even support sleep.
Some trail mix ingredients, such as  walnuts  and dried  cranberries , contain sleep-promoting nutrients. Depending on the mixture, a 1/4-cup (38-g) serving averages 173 calories. Measure your trail mix portions to avoid excess calories.

9. Yogurt
Yogurt  is an excellent source of calcium. Long known for keeping your bones strong, this mineral has recently been  linked to better sleep .
Yogurt, especially Greek yogurt, is also rich in protein — particularly casein.
Preliminary studies suggest that consuming  casein protein  at night  may help reduce hunger  the next morning.
If yogurt is your snack of choice, opt for plain and flavor it with unsweetened fruit such as berries or peaches.
A 6-oz (170-g) container of plain, nonfat Greek yogurt has  104 calories . Mixing in 1/2 cup (75 g) of blueberries adds  43 calories .
Yogurt is a good source of protein, which helps curb hunger. It’s also rich in calcium, which has been linked to better sleep. A 6-oz (170-g) container of plain, nonfat Greek yogurt has only 104 calories.

10. Whole grain wrap
Tortillas can be filled in any number of ways to satisfy late night hunger.
For a simple snack, warm one whole grain tortilla; top it with hummus, unsweetened nut butter, or sundried tomato spread; roll it up; and enjoy.
A medium (45-g) whole wheat tortilla has an average of  140 calories . Adding 1 tbsp (15 g) of hummus increases the number of calories by  39 .
You can add chopped chicken breast, leafy greens, and dried cranberries if you need something a little heartier.
Chicken is  a notable source  of tryptophan, which your body needs to make melatonin. Dried cranberries also supply melatonin.
A medium whole grain tortilla is a blank slate for a healthy late night snack and has only 140 calories. Just add nutritious toppings or fillings, such as hummus and leftover chicken breast, and enjoy.

11. Pumpkin seeds
A 1-oz (28-g) serving of  pumpkin seeds  has  158 calories  and provides 40% of the DV for magnesium, which has been linked to better sleep.
Pumpkin seeds are  also rich  in tryptophan.
Eating pumpkin seeds along with some carbs, such as half an  apple  or some raisins, encourages your body to route the tryptophan in the seeds to your brain to make melatonin.
Pumpkin seeds are rich in magnesium and tryptophan, which may help support sleep, particularly when eaten with carbs such as raisins or fresh fruit. A 1-oz (28-g) serving of pumpkin seeds has 158 calories.

12. Edamame
Edamame  are unripe, green soybeans. They can be purchased fresh or frozen.
Toss fresh or thawed, shelled edamame with salt and pepper for a simple late night snack. You don’t even need to cook them. A 1/2-cup (78-g) serving has  94 calories .
Alternatively, you can buy dry-roasted edamame, which are similar to fully mature, roasted soybeans (nuts). A 1/4-cup (30-g) serving has  130 calories .
Edamame is a good source of protein, which includes  a notable amount  of tryptophan.
To help shuttle the tryptophan to your brain to make melatonin, pair the edamame with carbs.
For example, use edamame instead of garbanzo beans in your favorite hummus recipe and spread the hummus on whole grain toast. Or you can pair dry-roasted edamame with dried fruit.
Edamame (green soybeans) are a good source of protein, including tryptophan. You can buy them fresh, frozen, or dry-roasted. A 1/2-cup (78-g) serving of fresh edamame has 94 calories, while a 1/4-cup (30-g) serving of dry-roasted edamame has 130 calories.

13. Eggs
Eggs  are incredibly versatile and can be used in various snacks, depending on how much time and effort you want to put in.
For example, you can keep some hard-boiled eggs on hand for a quick snack. You can also turn them into egg salad and spread them on crackers.
Additionally, there are many grain-free egg muffin recipes online. These tasty treats can often be frozen and reheated later in an oven or microwave.
One large egg has just  72 calories  and supplies 6 g of hunger-satisfying protein, including 84 milligrams of tryptophan.
You may not think of eggs as a snack, but they’re quick to cook and a good source of protein, which helps tame your hunger. One large egg has just 72 calories.

14. Strawberries and brie
If you’re looking for a large snack serving that doesn’t pack a lot of calories, reach for fresh strawberries.
Strawberries are an  excellent source of vitamin C .
One cup (166 g) of sliced strawberries has only  53 calories , so you could enjoy 2 cups and stay well below the recommended 200-calorie limit for a late night snack.
Alternatively, you could pair 1 cup (166 g) of sliced strawberries with 1 oz (28 g) of brie. The cheese adds  95 calories  and 6 g of hunger-satisfying protein.
Keep in mind that brie and other soft cheeses are not recommended for people who are pregnant. Eating soft cheese carries a risk of listeria infection, which may cause miscarriage.
Fresh strawberries are great when you want a visually satisfying, large snack with relatively few calories. Pairing them with brie provides protein, which helps satisfy hunger longer. One cup (166 g) of strawberries with a 1-oz (28-g) side of brie has only 147 calories.
