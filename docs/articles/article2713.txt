Title: How to Follow a Cutting Diet for Weight Loss

A cutting diet involves calculating your calorie, protein, fat, and carb needs to reduce body fat and maintain muscle mass. Paired with weightlifting, it’s usually done before a major athletic competition.
Cutting is a fat-loss phase that bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts use to get as lean as possible.
Typically started a few months before a major workout plan, it involves a weight loss diet that’s meant to maintain as much muscle as possible.
This article explains how to follow a cutting diet for weight loss.

What is a cutting diet?
A cutting diet is usually followed by  bodybuilders  and fitness enthusiasts to cut body fat while maintaining muscle mass.
The key distinctions from other weight loss diets are that a cutting diet is catered to each individual, tends to be higher in protein and carbs, and should be accompanied by  weightlifting .
Lifting weights regularly is important because it  promotes muscle growth , helping prevent muscle loss when you start cutting calories.
A cutting diet lasts  2–4 months , depending on how lean you are before dieting, and is typically timed around bodybuilding competitions, athletic events, or occasions like holidays.

How to do a cutting diet
A cutting diet is tailored to each individual and requires you to determine your nutritional needs.
Fat loss occurs when you consistently eat fewer calories than you burn.
The  number of calories you should eat per day  to lose weight  depends  on your weight, height, lifestyle, sex, and exercise levels.
You can estimate the number of calories you need to consume daily to maintain your weight using an online calorie calculator. To lose 1 pound (lb) or 0.45 kilograms (kg) per week, simply subtract 500 calories from this number.
Alternatively, a registered dietitian can help determine how many calories you should consume daily, depending on your goals.
A slow, even rate of weight loss — such as 1 lb (0.45 kg) or  0.5–1%  of your body weight per week — is best for a cutting diet.
Although a larger calorie deficit may  help you lose weight  faster, it can increase your risk of losing muscle, which is not ideal for this diet.
Maintaining adequate  protein intake  is important in a cutting diet.
Research from 2020  suggests that  high protein intake  can help with fat loss by:
boosting your metabolism
reducing your appetite
preserving lean muscle mass
If you’re on a cutting diet, you may need to eat more protein than if you’re merely trying to maintain weight or  build muscle mass . That’s because while you’re getting  fewer calories , you’re exercising regularly, which increases your protein needs.
Most research suggests that  1–1.4 grams (g)  of protein per lb of body weight (2.2–3.0 g/kg) is sufficient for conserving muscle mass on a cutting diet.
For example, a 155 lb (70 kg) person should eat 150–210 grams of protein daily.
Fat plays  a key role  in hormone production, which makes it crucial for a cutting diet.
While it’s common to reduce fat intake on a cutting diet, not eating enough can affect the production of hormones like testosterone and IGF-1, which help preserve muscle mass.
For example,  research in 2021  demonstrates that reducing fat intake lowers testosterone levels by a modest but significant amount.
However, some  older evidence  suggests that a drop in testosterone levels does not always lead to muscle loss — as long as you eat enough protein and carbs.
Experts suggest that, on this diet,  20–30%  of your calories should come from fat.
One gram of fat contains 9 calories, so anyone on a 2,000-calorie regimen should eat 44–67 g of fat per day on a cutting diet.
If you do intense exercise, the lower end of that fat range may be best because it allows for higher carb intake.
Carbs play a key role in preserving muscle mass while on a cutting diet.
Because your body  prefers  to use carbs for energy instead of protein, eating an adequate number of carbs may prevent muscle loss.
Additionally, carbs  can help  fuel your performance during workouts.
On a cutting diet, carbs should comprise the remaining calories after you subtract protein and fat, or around  0.9–2.2 g/lb (2–5 g/kg)  of body weight.
Protein and carbs both provide 4 calories per g, while fat stands at 9 calories per g. After subtracting your protein and fat needs from your total calorie intake, divide the remaining number by 4, telling you  how many carbs  you can eat daily.
For example, a 155 lb (70 kg) person on a 2,000-calorie cutting diet may eat 150 g of protein and 60 g of fat. The remaining 860 calories (215 g) can be taken up by carbs.

Does meal timing matter?
Meal timing  is a strategy used for muscle growth, fat loss, and performance.
Although it may benefit competitive athletes, it isn’t as important for fat loss.
Research from 2017  notes that endurance athletes can boost their recovery by timing their meals and carb intake around exercise.
That said, this isn’t necessary for the cutting diet.
Instead, you should focus on eating  whole foods  and getting enough calories, protein, carbs, and fat throughout the day.
If you’re hungry frequently,  2019 research  suggests that a high calorie breakfast may keep you fuller later in the day.

Cheat meals and refeed days
Cheat meals or refeed days are commonly incorporated into cutting diets.
“ Cheat meals ” are occasional indulgences meant to ease the strictness of a given diet, whereas  refeed days  boost your carb intake once or twice per week.
A higher carb intake can have  several benefits , such as:
restoring your body’s glucose stores
improving exercise performance
balancing several hormones
For example,  research from 2021  found that a higher carb intake can increase levels of the fullness hormone  leptin  and temporarily raise your metabolism.
Although you may gain weight after a cheat meal or refeed day, this  tends to be  water weight that’s usually lost over the next few days.
Still, it’s easy to overeat on these days and sabotage your weight loss efforts. Moreover, these routines  may promote  unhealthy habits, especially if you’re prone to  emotional eating .
On the other hand, bodybuilding is  linked  with an increased risk of  muscle dysmorphia  and disordered eating patterns.
Following an overly restrictive diet plan with no room for cheat meals may negatively affect your  relationship with food .
Therefore, it’s best to work with a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian, when planning your diet. This can ensure that you’re meeting your nutritional needs and help you avoid falling into overly restrictive eating habits.

Helpful tips for a cutting diet
Here are some helpful tips to keep your goals on track on a cutting diet:
Choose more fiber-rich foods:  Fiber-rich carb sources like  non-starchy vegetables  tend to contain more nutrients and  can help  you stay fuller for longer while on a calorie deficit.
Drink plenty of water:   Staying hydrated  may  help curb  your appetite and temporarily speed up your metabolism.
Try meal prepping:  Preparing meals ahead of schedule can help save time, keep you on track with your diet, and avoid the temptation of high calorie convenience foods.
Avoid liquid carbs:  Sports drinks, soft drinks, and other sugar-rich beverages lack  micronutrients , may increase your appetite, and  aren’t as filling  as fiber-rich, whole foods.
Consider cardio:  Aerobic exercise — especially high intensity cardio —  may further  your fat loss when used alongside weightlifting.

Frequently asked questions
A cutting diet is meant to  maximize fat loss  while maintaining muscle mass. However, you’re only meant to follow it for a few months before an athletic event and should combine it with weightlifting.
In bodybuilding, a shredded diet is another term for a cutting diet. To understand what you should eat, calculate your daily calorie, protein, fat, and carb requirements in order to reduce body fat while maintaining muscle mass.
Whether you should  bulk or cut  first depends on your goals. If you already have all the muscle mass you want and your goal is to get leaner, then there’s no need to go through a bulking phase.
However, if your goals include gaining additional muscle, then adding that mass will require a surplus of calories to promote muscle growth. This means cutting is a secondary step.
That said, bulking is not the same as overeating. As someone gains muscle mass, if they manage their calorie intake well and eat only the additional calories needed to add muscle, they can do so without gaining too much additional body fat.

The bottom line
A cutting diet is used to lose fat while maintaining muscle mass. It involves calculating daily calorie, protein, fat, and carbohydrate needs based on weight and activity level.
If you want to try this diet, it’s a good idea to work with a trainer or healthcare professional first. This diet should only be followed for a few months prior to a sports competition while supplementing it with weightlifting.
