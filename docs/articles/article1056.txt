Title: 11 Healthier Fast-Food Breakfast Options

Making time for a healthy breakfast when you have a busy schedule isn’t always possible. Sometimes, you may therefore find yourself at the closest drive-through, grabbing something on your way to work.
Fast food is often thought of as unhealthy, and for good reason — most options will cost you lots of calories, saturated fat, added sugar, and sodium. Fortunately, healthier choices are available.
We researched popular fast-food restaurants to find you 11 healthier fast-food breakfast options.

This smoothie gets its sweetness from bananas and includes both almonds and protein to make it a complete meal filled with healthy fats, fruit, and protein. It has just 22 grams of carbs, so if you’re limiting carbs, this can be a great choice.

How to order healthier fast food
Fast food is typically seen as unhealthy, but in today’s fast-paced world, it’s a convenient way to get a meal when you’re on the go. Here are some tips for ordering healthier.
Most fast-food restaurants offer fresh fruit as a side, which is a more nutritious and filling option than sides like french fries or hash browns.
By enjoying fresh fruit with your fast-food breakfast meal, you add nutrients and fiber to your meal. The  fiber  can help you feel full for longer, especially if you choose one of the lower calorie options on this list.
Because fiber and protein can be filling, it’s a good idea to choose meals that offer a good amount of both.
When ordering breakfast, high protein options can include eggs or egg whites,  cheese , or yogurt. Fruits and nuts are good examples of high fiber breakfast ingredients.
Some drinks on fast food menus can add a lot of sugar and empty calories to your order.
A simple way to save calories is to stick with water or unsweetened beverages, such as black coffee or tea, instead of milkshakes,  sodas , sugar-sweetened iced coffees, or iced teas.
Fast-food restaurants are required to provide nutritional information for their menu items, so if you have the time, try to identify some options before you hit the drive-through. This way, you can make an informed, healthy decision.

The bottom line
Whether you’re looking for oatmeal, sandwiches, smoothies, or something else, several fast-food breakfast options are available — and they aren’t all that unhealthy for you.
As a general rule, opt for foods that are high in protein, veggies, fiber, and fruit, and avoid those with lots of sodium, saturated fats, added sugar, and calories.
Try this today:  Stop by the website of your favorite fast-food breakfast stop and check out their menu before your next morning visit to identify a healthy option or two.
