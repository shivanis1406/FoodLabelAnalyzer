Title: The Beginner's Guide to the 5:2 Diet

Healthline Diet Score: 3.96 out of 5
Intermittent fasting  is an eating pattern that involves regular fasting.
The 5:2 diet, also known as The Fast Diet, is a popular intermittent fasting diet.
It was popularized by British journalist Michael Mosley.
It’s called the 5:2 diet because five days of the week are routine eating days, while the other two restrict calories to 500–600 per day.
Because there are no requirements about  which  foods to eat but rather  when  you should eat them, this diet is more of a lifestyle.
Many people find this way of eating to be easier to stick to than a traditional calorie-restricted diet.
This article explains everything you need to know about the 5:2 diet.

How to do the 5:2 diet
The 5:2 diet is actually very simple to explain.
For five days per week, you eat normally and don’t have to think about restricting calories.
Then, on the other two days, you reduce your calorie intake to a quarter of your daily needs. This is about 500  calories per day  for women, and 600 for men.
You can choose whichever two days of the week you prefer, as long as there is at least one non-fasting day in between them.
One common way of planning the week is to fast on Mondays and Thursdays, with two or three small meals, then eat normally for the rest of the week.
It’s important to emphasize that eating “normally” does not mean you can eat anything. If you eat too much junk food, then you probably won’t  lose any weight , and you may even gain weight.
You should eat the same amount of food as if you hadn’t been fasting at all.

Health benefits of intermittent fasting
There are very few studies on the 5:2 diet specifically.
However,  recent   studies  on intermittent fasting in general show impressive  health benefits .
One important benefit is that intermittent fasting seems to be easier to follow than continuous calorie restriction, at least for some people. However, the  research  is conflicting, with  some noting  that intermittent fasting and traditional dieting have similar adherence rates.
Also,  many studies   have shown  that different types of intermittent fasting may significantly reduce insulin levels.
One 2011 study  showed that the 5:2 diet caused weight loss similar to regular calorie restriction. Additionally, the diet was very effective at reducing insulin levels and  improving insulin sensitivity .
Several studies  have looked into the health effects of modified  alternate-day fasting , which is very similar to the 5:2 diet (ultimately, it’s a 4:3 diet).
The 4:3 diet may help reduce insulin resistance,  asthma ,  seasonal allergies ,  heart arrhythmias , menopausal  hot flashes , and more.
One  2013 randomized controlled study  in both moderate-weight and overweight individuals showed major improvements in the group doing 4:3 fasting, compared to the control group that ate as usual.
After 12 weeks, the fasting group had:
Reduced body weight by more than 11 pounds (5 kg).
Reduced fat mass by 7.7 pounds (3.5 kg), with no change in muscle mass.
Reduced blood levels of triglycerides by 20%.
Increased LDL particle size, which is a good thing.
Reduced levels of  C-reactive protein (CRP) , an important marker of inflammation.
Decreased levels of  leptin  by up to 40%.

The 5:2 diet for weight loss
If you need to lose weight, the 5:2 diet can be  very effective  when done right.
This is mainly because the 5:2 eating pattern helps you consume fewer calories.
Therefore, it is very important not to compensate for the fasting days by eating much more on the non-fasting days.
Intermittent fasting does not cause more weight loss than regular calorie restriction if total calories are matched.
That said, fasting protocols similar to the 5:2 diet have shown a lot of promise in weight loss studies:
A  2014 review  found that modified alternate-day fasting led to a weight loss of 3–8% over the course of 3–24 weeks.
In the same study, participants lost 4–7% of their waist circumference, meaning that they lost a lot of harmful  belly fat .
Intermittent fasting causes a much smaller reduction in  muscle mass  when compared to weight loss with conventional calorie restriction.
Intermittent fasting has  been shown  to be even more effective when combined with exercise, such as  endurance  or  strength training .

How to eat on fasting days
There is no rule for what or when to eat on fasting days.
Some people function best by beginning the day with a small breakfast, while others find it best to start eating as late as possible.
Generally, there are two meal patterns that people follow:
Three small meals:  Usually breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Two slightly bigger meals:  Only lunch and dinner.
Since calorie intake is limited — 500 calories for women and 600 calories for men — it makes sense to use your calorie budget wisely.
Try to focus on nutritious,  high fiber ,  high protein  foods that will make you feel full without consuming too many calories.
Soups are a great option on fast days.  Studies  have shown that they may make you feel more full than the same ingredients in their original form, or foods with the same calorie content.
Here are a few examples of foods that may be suitable for fast days:
A generous portion of  vegetables
Natural  yogurt  with berries
Boiled or baked  eggs
Grilled  fish  or lean meat
Cauliflower rice
Soups (for example  miso ,  tomato ,  cauliflower , or vegetable)
Low calorie cup soups
Black  coffee
Tea
Still or sparkling  water
There is no specific, correct way to eat on fasting days. You have to experiment and figure out what works best for you.

What to do if you feel unwell or uncontrollably hungry
During the first few fast days, you can expect to have episodes of overwhelming hunger. It is also expected to feel a little weaker or slower than usual.
However, you’ll be surprised at how quickly the hunger fades, especially if you try to keep busy with work or other errands.
Additionally, most people find that the fast days become easier after the first few fasts.
If you are not used to fasting, it may be a good idea to keep a small snack handy during your first few fasts, just in case you feel faint or ill.
But if you repeatedly find yourself feeling ill or faint during fast days, have something to eat and talk with your medical professional about whether you should continue.
Intermittent fasting is not for everyone, and some people are unable to tolerate it.

Who should avoid the 5:2 diet, or intermittent fasting overall?
Although intermittent fasting is very safe for healthy, well-nourished people, it does not suit everyone.
Some people should avoid dietary restrictions and fasting completely. These include:
Individuals with a history of  eating disorders .
Individuals who often experience drops in blood sugar levels.
Pregnant people, nursing people, teenagers, children, and individuals with  type 1 diabetes .
People who are malnourished, underweight, or have known nutrient deficiencies.
People who are trying to conceive or have  fertility issues .
Furthermore, intermittent fasting  may not be  as beneficial for some women as it is for men.
Some women have reported that their menstrual period stopped while they were following this type of eating pattern. However, their period went back to usual when they returned to a regular diet.
Therefore, women should be careful when starting any form of intermittent fasting, and stop doing it immediately if any adverse effects occur.

The bottom line
The 5:2 diet is an easy, effective way to  lose weight  and improve metabolic health.
Many people find it much easier to stick to than a conventional calorie-restricted diet.
If you’re looking to lose weight or improve your health, the 5:2 diet is definitely something to consider.
