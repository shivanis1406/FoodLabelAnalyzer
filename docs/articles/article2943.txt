Title: Perelel Health Review: A Dietitian’s Take and Mom’s Experience

Perelel specializes in third-party tested supplements for people at various stages of the reproductive cycle. A Healthline editor and dietitian shares her experience using the Perelel Trimester Prenatal Packs.
Perelel is a supplement manufacturer that offers products designed to support health at every reproductive stage, starting even before conception.
With its convenient packaging and extensive product selection, Perelel has recently emerged as one of the most popular prenatal brands on the market.
However, the supplements also have a steep price tag, causing many consumers to wonder whether they’re worth the investment.
This article will take a deep dive into the brand’s offerings, how they work, and who they may be a good fit for.

What is Perelel?
Perelel is a company that offers vitamin packs for people at various stages in their reproductive journey.
It was founded in 2020 by Alex Taylor and Victoria Thain Goia alongside Victoria’s OB-GYN, Dr. Banafsheh Bayati, MD, OB/GYN, FACOG.
The brand was born after they were frustrated with the lack of available high quality, sustainably sourced products, and they decided that  prenatal supplements  shouldn’t be one-size-fits-all.
Perelel offers daily multivitamins and single vitamins for men and women, vitamin packs formulated to  support conception , and prenatal supplements designed specifically for each trimester.
All supplements are third-party tested for purity and potency, non-GMO, and free of gluten, soy, and artificial colors and fillers.

In addition to its daily vitamin packs, Perelel also offers a range of other products, including:
Mom Multi Support Pack:  This supplement is designed to provide support throughout motherhood, with convenient once-daily packs that provide a blend of essential nutrients, including a multivitamin, omega-3 fatty acids, collagen, and biotin. This supplement also contains ashwagandha and L-theanine, which haven’t been proven safe during breastfeeding. Because of this, Healthline doesn’t recommend it for people who are breastfeeding.
Men’s Multi Support Pack:  This supplement is designed to  promote male fertility , with a multivitamin and ingredients like omega-3 fatty acids and  coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) .
Egg Freeze Support Pack:  Formulated to support overall health throughout the  egg freezing process , Perelel’s Egg Freeze Support Pack contains a multivitamin, omega-3 fatty acids, CoQ10, and iron.
Recovery Support Pack:  This supplement is intended to support the healing process after a reproductive loss. It contains a multivitamin, omega-3 fatty acids, iron, and a “recovery support blend” with stress-easing herbal ingredients like  ashwagandha .
Cycle Support Pack:  This pack of supplements is created to align to each part of your cycle with Bloat Ease, Iron Ease, and PMS Relief assigned to various days of the month.
Urinary Tract Support Powder:  Available in Raspberry Mango-flavored powder form, this product contains ingredients like  D-mannose , a type of sugar that may help  prevent recurrent urinary tract infections .
Synbiotic Greens Powder:  This includes a blend of powdered greens and fruit, prebiotic fiber, and 5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of Bacillus subtilis, a probiotic with  clinical evidence  of improving the gut microbiome.
Sleep Support:  This supplement contains three forms of magnesium to support better sleep. However, while  observational studies  suggest that increased magnesium intake may be linked to improved sleep quality, clinical trials have yielded mixed results. Also,  lemon balm  hasn’t been shown to be safe during breastfeeding and should be avoided by people who are nursing.
Hormonal Balance Support:  This multivitamin is for people who experience irregular cycles. It includes a variety of herbs and compounds to encourage overall hormone balance and regular ovulation.
Daily Probiotic:  This probiotic contains 10 billion CFUs of various strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium to help support gut and  vaginal health .
Omega DHA + EPA with Choline:  This supplement contains key nutrients to help support fetal brain development, as well as maternal mood and heart health throughout pregnancy.
Daily Iron Ease:  Designed to help increase iron levels before, during, or after pregnancy, this supplement pairs iron with vitamin C, vitamin B12, and magnesium.
Libido Support:  Made with a “sexual arousal blend,” this product contains herbal ingredients like  maca  and  L-arginine , which could help promote a  healthy libido .
Bloat Relief:  This supplement contains a blend of ingredients to ease gas and bloating and reduce symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and indigestion, including  ginger root  and  licorice root extracts .

How much does Perelel cost?
Prices for Perelel can vary, depending on the specific products you select and whether you opt for a recurring subscription.
Trimester Packs, Conception Support Pack, and Mom Multi Support Pack:  $58.24 for a 1-month supply, or $49.50 with a monthly subscription.
Men’s Multi Support Pack and Women’s Daily Vitamin Trio:  $46–$50 for a one-time purchase or around $40–$42 with a subscription.
Most other supplements:  $25–$61.70 per month.
Shipping:  Free for one-time purchases over $58.50 and subscriptions of at least $34.

Quality and ingredients
Perelel notes that all supplements are third-party tested to ensure safety and quality, though it doesn’t disclose the specific lab or testing facility.
Perelel also claims that its supplements are manufactured in facilities that are  CGMP certified .
While most of the ingredients in its supplements are supported by evidence, a few are less well supported by research.
For example, many of its supplements contain a “beauty blend” with biotin, which supposedly plays a role in hair, skin, and nail health. Growing  research  generally suggests that biotin supplementation is unlikely to be beneficial unless you have a deficiency or certain underlying health conditions.

Other considerations
Not all of Perelel’s supplements are suitable for pregnancy and breastfeeding.
Specifically, several of the company’s products feature  ashwagandha , including:
Mom Multi Support Pack
Recovery Support Pack
Libido Support
These supplements should not be used by people who are pregnant, as they could have  negative effects on fetal health  in high doses.
Ashwagandha is also not recommended for people who are breastfeeding, as there is  limited research on its safety . It can also interact with several medications, including some sedatives, blood thinners, thyroid supplements, anxiety medications, high blood pressure medications, diabetes medications, and others.
Be sure to talk with a doctor or other healthcare professional before starting any supplementation to address any concerns, especially if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have underlying health conditions.

Editor’s experience trying Perelel Trimester Prenatal Packs
Name:  Kelli McGrane, MS, RD
Role:  Healthline nutrition editor and registered dietitian
After finding out I was pregnant with baby number two, I started doing my research to determine which prenatal vitamin would be best for me.
I ultimately decided on Perelel’s Trimester Prenatal Packs and took them throughout most of my pregnancy.
Here are my six main takeaways:
As a dietitian and editor of dietary supplement content (including prenatal vitamins), when I found out I was pregnant, I thought I knew the exact prenatal that I was going to purchase — and it wasn’t Perelel.
While I liked Perelel,  FullWell  was at the top of my list because it offers more choline and vitamin D. However, when I factored in the cost of shipping and buying the accompanying  omega-3 supplement , the monthly cost added up to over $80, which was more than I was comfortable spending.
The more research I did, the more I kept coming back to Perelel.
Yes, Perelel might also seem expensive at first, but because the packs include high quality forms of the nutrients that I was looking for, and because I felt confident that I would consume  enough choline in my diet , I ultimately came to the conclusion that Perelel’s daily packs offered the best value for my needs.
Getting started with Perelel was straightforward. Because I was in my first trimester, I simply selected the First Trimester Prenatal Vitamin Pack, clicked the Subscribe & Save option, entered in my due date, and added the product to my cart.
My first shipment arrived approximately 7 days later. Subsequent orders arrived about 1 week before I needed them, which was really handy because I never had to worry about going a day or two without my prenatal.
I was skeptical about whether daily packs would be more convenient than a standard vitamin jar. While I probably wouldn’t pay more for daily packs, it was definitely a nice bonus.
Especially during pregnancy when you might have multiple supplement bottles, the daily packs came in handy for weekend trips to the mountains and longer vacations.
Not only did I like not having to lug multiple bottles around, but the packs also made it easy to remember whether I’d taken my prenatals — which, between “ pregnancy brain ” and chasing around a 2-year-old, isn’t always the easiest thing to recall.
The biggest downside of Perelel was the number of pills. I don’t mind swallowing pills, and Perelel’s capsules are relatively easy to swallow. However, there were days when gulping down five capsules made me feel a bit nauseated.
I’m happy to report that the omega-3 tablet didn’t cause the infamous fishy burps that can occur with some  fish oil supplements . However, the tablet  definitely  had a fishy taste that became more apparent the longer it sat on my tongue.
Iron needs are higher  during pregnancy  to support an increased blood supply. For that reason, many prenatals, Perelel included, contain iron. However, a not-so-fun  side effect of supplemental iron  is constipation.
Because  constipation  is already a common symptom of pregnancy, some people may find that an iron-containing supplement, like Perelel, makes their constipation worse.
It’s important to note that Perelel’s prenatals contain a form of iron that is less likely to cause constipation than other forms. However, toward the end of my first trimester, I found that I was getting constipated and needed to switch to an iron-free prenatal for a few weeks until my bowel habits started to normalize again.
Once I was a few weeks into my second trimester, I was able to keep things moving by drinking lots of water, eating plenty of soluble  fiber-rich foods , and alternating between Perelel and an iron-free supplement every few days. I ultimately kept with this regimen the rest of my pregnancy.
Because iron needs vary by individual, it’s important to talk with your OB-GYN or other healthcare professional about whether an iron or iron-free prenatal is right for you.
During my first pregnancy, I wasn’t as picky about the prenatal I chose and went with an inexpensive — though third-party tested — option from my local pharmacy. While my son was perfectly healthy, I didn’t experience some of the positive side effects that are often associated with prenatals, like thicker hair and stronger nails.
In contrast, during my second pregnancy, I noticed subtle differences: My hair was thicker and shinier, my nails didn’t break as easily, and I felt overall more energized, despite going through pregnancy with a toddler at home.
While there were likely multiple factors at play, I do believe that these positive side effects were at least in part due to the high quality of Perelel’s prenatal.

Customer reviews
Online reviews of Perelel’s supplements are also generally positive and are listed publicly on the company’s website.
Many reviewers express satisfaction with the convenience of the once-daily packs, along with the effectiveness of the products.
Some also state that certain ingredients included in the formulations, such as  ginger , can help with nausea and morning sickness.
Meanwhile, less favorable reviews report that certain supplements have a fishy taste and odor or note dissatisfaction with the high price tag of products.
A few also state that the number of pills in each pack can be overwhelming and may be difficult to keep down.

Perelel vs. competitors
Many companies offer supplements designed to support reproductive health and pregnancy. Here is a closer look at how Perelel compares with a few of its competitors:

Who is Perelel for?
Perelel may be a good option for people who are looking for a streamlined supplement routine that’s tailored to their needs before, during, and after pregnancy.
In particular, it might be a good choice for:
people at various stages in their reproductive journey
those interested in a convenient, once-daily supplement pack
individuals seeking personalized product recommendations
people with specific health concerns, such as  polycystic ovary syndrome  or a low libido
those seeking a simple subscription option
On the other hand, Perelel may not be the right fit for:
people following a  vegan  or vegetarian diet
those on a tight budget
people who have difficulty swallowing pills
those who dislike taking multiple pills each day

Frequently asked questions
Both Perelel and Ritual prioritize high quality ingredients, and its prenatal vitamins are third-party tested to confirm purity and potency.
However, Perelel’s prenatals differ in that they’re formulated based on trimester and are more comprehensive. In contrast,  Ritual’s prenatal  is designed to help bridge nutrient gaps in an otherwise balanced diet. For this reason, it only contains 12 essential vitamins and minerals.
A benefit of Ritual is that its prenatal is $10 cheaper and is suitable for people following a vegan diet.

The bottom line
Perelel is a supplement manufacturer that specializes in providing vitamin packs specifically curated for various reproductive stages.
In addition to its extensive selection of third-party tested supplements, the brand’s once-daily packs and recurring subscriptions — which are automatically updated as you progress through your pregnancy — may make it a convenient alternative to other prenatal vitamins.
However, it’s also expensive, not suitable for certain dietary restrictions, and requires you to take multiple pills per day, which might not be a good option for everyone.
