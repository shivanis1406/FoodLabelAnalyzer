What if you had a clear-cut, skimmable glossary to help you figure out what exactly you’re looking for and consuming? Good news—we made one!
We scoured the Internet, consulted with our medical team, and even asked you about the under-the-radar ingredients you wish you knew more about.
Keep this guide handy when perusing the grocery store, and you’ll be armed with the knowledge you need to make informed, healthy food choices.
Along with definitions, we’ve also included a quick guide to let you know whether each ingredient is evidence-based—in other words, it does what all the buzz says it does.
Some have straightforward nutritional value while others may offer additional health benefits.
We’ve noted where the evidence is confirmed, mixed, emerging, or limited in scope, as well as when a specific additive is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
