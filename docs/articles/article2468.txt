Title: 10 Foods High in Phytoestrogens

Certain foods, such as flax seeds and peaches, contain phytoestrogens. These naturally occurring plant compounds may function in the same way as the human hormone estrogen.
Estrogen is a hormone that has many functions in the body, including promoting sexual and reproductive development. While it is present in people of all ages, females of reproductive age usually have higher levels of this hormone.
Estrogen carries out a  range of functions , including regulating the menstrual cycle and the growth and development of breasts.  During the transition to menopause , estrogen levels decline, leading lead to symptoms such as  hot flashes and night sweats .
Phytoestrogens, also known as dietary estrogen, are naturally occurring plant compounds that may function similarly to the estrogen the human body produces.
This article review 10 significant sources of dietary estrogens.

1. Flax seeds
Flax seeds are small golden or brown seeds that have recently gained popularity because of their potential  health benefits .
They’re incredibly rich in  lignans , chemical compounds that function as phytoestrogens. In fact, flax seeds contain more  lignans  than other plant foods.
Studies  suggest that the phytoestrogens found in flax seeds may play an important role in decreasing the risk of  breast cancer , especially in postmenopausal women.
Flax seeds are a rich source of lignans, chemical compounds that function as phytoestrogens. Eating flax seeds has been associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer.

2. Soybeans and edamame
Soybeans can be processed into many plant-based products, such as tofu and tempeh. They can also be enjoyed whole as edamame.
Edamame beans are green, immature soybeans that are often sold frozen in their inedible pods.
Both soybeans and edamame have been linked to many  health benefits  and are rich in protein and many  vitamins and minerals .
They are also rich in phytoestrogens known as  isoflavones .
Soy isoflavones can produce estrogen-like activity in the body by mimicking the effects of natural estrogen. They  may increase or decrease blood estrogen levels .
Research suggests that soy isoflavones may help make hot flashes less frequent and less severe. Additionally, eating a diet rich in soy early in life may lower breast cancer risk, but this effect has not been demonstrated in low soy diets such as the typical Western diet.
Soy isoflavone supplements  may also benefit bone health  after menopause.
The effect of soy isoflavones on human estrogen levels is complex. Ultimately, more research is needed before health experts can draw conclusions.
Soybeans and edamame are rich in isoflavones, a type of phytoestrogen. Soy isoflavones may affect blood estrogen levels in your body, although more research is needed.

3. Dried fruits
Dried fruits  are nutrient-rich, delicious, and easy to enjoy as a no-fuss snack.
They are also a  potent source of various phytoestrogens .
Dates,  prunes , and dried apricots are a few of the dried fruits highest in phytoestrogens.
What’s more, dried fruits are chock-full of  fiber  and other important nutrients that make them a healthy snack.
Dried fruits are potent sources of phytoestrogens. Dried apricots, dates, and prunes are some of the dried fruits with the highest phytoestrogen content.

4. Sesame seeds
Sesame seeds  are small, fiber-packed seeds that are commonly incorporated into Asian dishes to add a delicate crunch and nutty flavor.
They are also quite rich in phytoestrogens, among other important nutrients.
A  2020 study  found that sesame can have a variety of health benefits. They may have a protective effect on the heart, liver, and kidneys, and can be used in the treatment of diseases as they have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-cancer, anti-cholesterol, and anti-aging effects.
A  2023 study  found that daily intake of sesame seeds in post-menopausal women had a positive affect on their bone health.
A  2024 study  in rats also found that daily consumption of sesame oil prevented  postmenopausal osteoporosis  by maintaining levels of estrogen and aromatose.
Sesame seeds are a potent source of phytoestrogens. Studies have found that sesame seeds have a positive effect on bone-related issues experienced by postmenopausal women.

5. Garlic
Garlic is a popular ingredient that adds a pungent flavor and aroma to dishes.
It’s not only touted for its culinary attributes but also renowned for its  health properties .
Although studies on the effects of garlic in humans are limited, a  2023 study  in rats theorized that its estrogen-like antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties may protect against bone loss in post-menopausal women. However, more human studies are needed.
In addition to offering a distinctive taste and health benefits, garlic is rich in phytoestrogens and may help reduce bone loss related to estrogen deficiency. However, more research in humans is needed.

6. Peaches
Peaches  are a sweet fruit with yellowish or white flesh and fuzzy skin.
They are not only packed with vitamins and minerals but also  rich in phytoestrogens  known as lignans.
Interestingly, a  2009 analysis of studies  suggests that lignan-rich diets may decrease the risk of  breast cancer  by 15% in postmenopausal females. However, more research is needed to understand the potential benefits.
Peaches are sweet, delicious, and packed with a variety of nutrients. They are rich in lignans, a type of phytoestrogen.

7. Berries
Berries have long been touted for their many impressive  health benefits .
They’re loaded with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and beneficial plant compounds, including phytoestrogens.
Berries, such as  strawberries  and blackberries, are all  rich sources of phytoestrogens .
Many berries — including strawberries and blackberries — are rich in phytoestrogens.

8. Tofu
Tofu  is made from coagulated soy milk pressed into firm white blocks. It’s a popular plant-based protein source, especially in vegan and vegetarian diets.
It’s also a concentrated source of phytoestrogens, largely isoflavones.
Tofu has one of the highest levels of isoflavone content of any soy product. And while  soy milk  has lower isoflavone levels, it’s still a  good source .
Tofu is made from soy milk condensed into solid white blocks. It’s a rich source of isoflavones, a type of phytoestrogen.

9. Cruciferous vegetables
Cruciferous vegetables are a large group of plants with diverse flavors, textures, and nutrients.
Broccoli, cabbage, and collard greens are all cruciferous  vegetables  rich in  phytoestrogens .
Broccoli  is rich in secoisolariciresinol, a type of lignan phytoestrogen.
Brussels sprouts  are rich in coumestrol, another type of phytonutrient that has been found to  exhibit estrogenic activity .
Cruciferous vegetables are rich in phytoestrogens, including lignans and coumestrol.

10. Tempeh
Tempeh , a fermented soy product, is a popular vegetarian meat replacement.
It’s made from whole soybeans that have been  fermented  and pressed into a firm, dense cake.
Tempeh is not only an excellent source of  protein, prebiotics, vitamins, and minerals  but also a very rich source of phytoestrogens, especially isoflavones.
Tempeh is a common vegetarian meat replacement made of fermented soybeans. Like other soy products, tempeh is rich in isoflavones.

How do phytoestrogens affect your health?
Phytoestrogens have a similar chemical structure to estrogen and may mimic its hormonal actions.
Phytoestrogens attach to estrogen receptors in your cells, potentially affecting the function of estrogen throughout your body. However, not all phytoestrogens function in the same way.
Research  has found that phytoestrogens have both estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects. This means that some phytoestrogens have estrogen-like effects and increase estrogen levels in your body, while others block the hormone’s effects and decrease estrogen levels.
Because of their complex actions, phytoestrogens are a controversial topic in nutrition and health.
While some researchers have raised concerns that a high intake of phytoestrogens may cause  hormonal imbalance , most evidence has linked them to positive health effects.
In fact,  studies  have associated phytoestrogen intake after menopause with decreased cholesterol levels,  reduced menopausal symptoms , and a lower risk of osteoporosis and certain types of cancer, including breast cancer.
However,  some researchers  suggest that the beneficial effects may be small, and studies that demonstrate long-term results are still needed.

Are phytoestrogens dangerous?
The health benefits of consuming phytoestrogen-rich foods likely outweigh the potential risks, so the 10 foods reviewed in this article can be consumed safely in moderation.
Although people have raised the following potential concerns about phytoestrogens, recent research has largely disputed these concerns:
Infertility:  While some research states that phytoestrogens may harm reproductive health, the bulk of it has been conducted on animal models, and strong human studies are lacking. One  2020 study  of women trying to become pregnant found no strong links between phytoestrogen intake and pregnancy rates.
Breast cancer:  Limited research suggests a link between phytoestrogens and an increased risk of  breast cancer . However, some studies have observed the opposite — that high phytoestrogen intake may be linked to a decreased risk. A  2020 study  suggests that phytoestrogen intake may improve breast cancer survival rates.
Effects on testosterone in men:  Contrary to popular belief,  studies  have shown that phytoestrogen intake has  no effect on testosterone or other androgens  in men.
Decreased thyroid function:  Some earlier research associated intake of soy isoflavones with decreased  thyroid hormone  production. However more recent studies, such as this  2021 study  and this  2019 review of studies , found that soy supplementation has no effect on the thyroid hormones and only slightly raises TSH levels.
Some animal studies have identified potential health risks associated with phytoestrogen intake, but strong human research is lacking. Conversely, many studies have linked phytoestrogen intake to multiple health benefits and protective effects.
