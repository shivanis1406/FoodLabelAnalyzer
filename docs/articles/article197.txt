Title: 12 Healthy Foods That Are High in Iron

Iron is an essential nutrient, meaning you must get it from food. Luckily, there are plenty of good foods with iron to help you meet your daily needs.
Iron is a mineral that serves several important functions, its main one being to carry oxygen throughout your body as a part of red blood cells ( 1 ).
The Daily Value (DV) for iron is 8-18 mg for non-pregnant adults. A deficiency can occur if your intake is too low to replace the amount you lose daily ( 2 ).
Interestingly, the amount of iron your body absorbs is partly based on how much you have stored.
Iron deficiency can cause anemia and lead to symptoms like fatigue. Menstruating women who don’t consume iron-rich foods are at a particularly high risk of deficiency.
Here are 12 healthy foods that are high in iron.

1. Shellfish
Shellfish is tasty and nutritious. All shellfish is high in iron, but clams, oysters, and mussels are particularly good sources.
For instance, a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of clams may contain up to 3 mg of iron, which is 17% of the DV ( 3 ).
However, the iron content of clams is highly variable, and some types may contain much lower amounts ( 4 ).
The iron in shellfish is heme iron, which your body absorbs more easily than the non-heme iron found in plants.
A 3.5-ounce serving of clams also provides 26 grams of protein, 24% of the DV for vitamin C, and a whopping 4,125% of the DV for vitamin B12.
In fact, shellfish are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids which have been shown to increase the levels of heart-healthy HDL cholesterol ( 5 ).
Although there are legitimate concerns about  mercury  and toxins in certain types of  fish  and shellfish, the benefits of consuming seafood far outweigh the risks ( 6 ).
The EPA and FDA recommend eating 2 to 3 servings of seafood a week from their “Best Choices” list, which includes such shellfish as clams, oysters, and scallops ( 7 ).
A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of clams provides 17% of the DV for iron. Shellfish is also rich in many other nutrients and may increase HDL (good) cholesterol levels in your blood.

2. Spinach
Spinach provides many health benefits but very few  calories .
About 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of raw spinach contain 2.7 mg of iron, or 15% of the DV ( 8 ).
Although this is non-heme iron, which isn’t absorbed very well, spinach is also rich in vitamin C. This is important since vitamin C significantly boosts  iron absorption  ( 9 ).
Spinach is also rich in antioxidants called carotenoids, which may reduce your risk of cancer,  decrease inflammation , and protect your eyes from disease ( 10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13 ).
Consuming spinach and other  leafy greens  with fat helps your body absorb the carotenoids, so make sure to eat a healthy fat like  olive oil  with your spinach ( 14 ).
Spinach provides 15% of the DV for iron per serving, along with several vitamins and minerals. It also contains important antioxidants.

3. Liver and other organ meats
Organ meats  are extremely nutritious. Popular types include liver, kidneys, brain, and heart — all of which are high in iron.
For example, a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of beef liver contains 6.5 mg of iron, or 36% of the DV ( 15 ).
Organ meats are also high in protein and rich in B vitamins, copper, and  selenium .
Liver is especially high in vitamin A, providing an impressive 1,049% of the DV per 3.5-ounce serving.
What’s more, organ meats are among the best sources of  choline , an important nutrient for brain and liver health that many people don’t get enough of ( 16 ).
Organ meats are good sources of iron, and liver contains 36% of the DV per serving. Organ meats are also rich in many other nutrients, such as selenium, vitamin A, and choline.

4. Legumes
Legumes  are loaded with nutrients.
Some of the  most common types  of legumes are beans, lentils, chickpeas, peas, and soybeans.
They’re a great source of iron, especially for vegetarians. One cup (198 grams) of cooked lentils contains 6.6 mg, which is 37% of the DV ( 17 ).
Beans like black beans, navy beans, and kidney beans can all help easily bump up your iron intake.
In fact, a half-cup (86-gram) serving of cooked black beans provides around 1.8 milligrams of iron, or 10% of the DV ( 18 ).
Legumes are also a good source of  folate ,  magnesium , and potassium.
What’s more, studies have shown that beans and other legumes can reduce inflammation in people with diabetes. Legumes can also decrease heart disease risk for people with metabolic syndrome ( 19 ,  20 ,  21 ,  22 ).
Additionally, legumes may help you lose weight. They’re very high in soluble fiber, which can increase feelings of fullness, reduce calorie intake, and promote healthy gut bacteria, which influences weight, inflammation and risk of chronic disease ( 23 ,  24 ,  25 ).
To maximize iron absorption, consume legumes with foods high in vitamin C, such as tomatoes, greens, or citrus fruits.
One cup (198 grams) of cooked lentils provides 37% of the DV for iron. Legumes are also high in folate, magnesium, potassium, and fiber and may even aid weight loss.

5. Red meat
Red meat  is satisfying and nutritious.
A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of ground beef contains 2.7 mg of iron, which is 15% of the DV ( 26 ).
Meat is also rich in  protein , zinc, selenium, and several B vitamins ( 27 ).
Researchers have suggested that iron deficiency may be less likely in people who eat meat, poultry, and fish on a regular basis ( 28 ).
In fact, red meat is probably the single most easily accessible source of heme iron, potentially making it an important food for people who are prone to anemia.
Research shows females consuming less than 2 ounces of red meat daily were more likely to have inadequate intakes below for zinc, iron, vitamin B12 and potassium and vitamin D intakes than females consuming between 2 and 3 ounces daily ( 29 ).
One serving of ground beef contains 15% of the DV for iron and is one of the most easily accessible sources of heme iron. It’s also rich in B vitamins, zinc, selenium, and high quality protein.

6. Pumpkin seeds
Pumpkin seeds are a tasty, portable snack.
A 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of pumpkin seeds contains 2.5 mg of iron, which is 14% of the DV ( 30 ).
In addition, pumpkin seeds are a good source of vitamin K, zinc, and manganese. They’re also among the  best sources of magnesium , which is a common dietary deficiency. ( 31 ).
A 1-ounce (28-gram) serving contains 40% of the DV for magnesium, which helps reduce your risk of  insulin resistance , diabetes, and depression ( 31 ,  32 ,  33 ).
Pumpkin seeds provide 14% of the DV for iron per 1-ounce serving. They’re also a good source of several other nutrients, particularly magnesium.

7. Quinoa
Quinoa  is a popular grain known as a pseudocereal. One cup (185 grams) of cooked quinoa provides 2.8 mg of iron, which is 16% of the DV ( 34 ).
Furthermore, quinoa contains no  gluten , making it a good choice for people with celiac disease or other forms of  gluten intolerance .
Quinoa is also higher in protein than many other grains, as well as rich in folate, magnesium, copper, manganese, and many other nutrients.
In addition, quinoa has more antioxidant activity than many other grains. Antioxidants help protect your cells from damage from free radicals, which are formed during metabolism and in response to stress ( 35 ,  36 ).
Quinoa provides 16% of the DV for iron per serving. It also contains no gluten and is high in protein, folate, minerals, and antioxidants.

8. Turkey
Turkey meat is a healthy and delicious food. It’s also a good source of iron, especially dark turkey meat.
A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) portion of dark turkey meat has 1.4 mg of iron, which is 8% of the DV ( 37 ).
In comparison, the same amount of white turkey meat contains only 0.7 mg ( 38 ).
Dark turkey meat also packs an impressive 28 grams of protein per serving and several B vitamins and minerals, including 32% of the DV for zinc and 57% of the DV for selenium.
Consuming  high protein foods  like turkey may aid  weight loss , as protein makes you feel full and increases your metabolic rate after a meal ( 36 ,  3 9 ,  40 ).
High protein intake can also help prevent the muscle loss that occurs during weight loss and the aging process ( 41 ,  42 ).
Turkey provides 13% of the DV for iron and is a good source of several vitamins and minerals. Its high protein content promotes fullness, increases metabolism, and prevents muscle loss

9. Broccoli
Broccoli is incredibly nutritious. A 1-cup (156-gram) serving of cooked broccoli contains 1 mg of iron, which is 6% of the DV ( 43 ).
What’s more, a serving of broccoli also packs 112% of the DV for vitamin C, which helps your body absorb the iron better ( 9 ,  44 ).
The same serving size is also high in folate and provides 5 grams of  fiber , as well as some vitamin K. Broccoli is a member of the cruciferous vegetable family, which also includes cauliflower, Brussels sprouts,  kale , and cabbage.
Cruciferous vegetables contain indole, sulforaphane, and glucosinolates, which are plant compounds believed to  protect against cancer  ( 45 ,  46 ,  47 ,  48 ).
One serving of broccoli provides 6% of the DV for iron and is very high in vitamins C, K, and folate. It may also help reduce cancer risk.

10. Tofu
Tofu  is a soy-based food that’s popular among vegetarians and in some Asian countries.
A half-cup (126-gram) serving provides 3.4 mg of iron, which is 19% of the DV ( 49 ).
Tofu is also a good source of thiamine and several minerals, including calcium, magnesium, and selenium. In addition, it provides 22 grams of protein per serving.
Tofu contains unique compounds called isoflavones, which have been linked to improved insulin sensitivity, a decreased risk of heart disease, and relief from  menopausal  symptoms ( 50 ,  51 ).
Tofu provides 19% of the DV for iron per serving and is rich in protein and minerals. Its isoflavones may improve heart health and relieve menopausal symptoms.

11. Dark chocolate
Dark chocolate  is incredibly delicious and nutritious.
A 1-ounce (28-gram) serving contains 3.4 mg of iron, which is 19% of the DV ( 52 ).
This small serving also packs 56% and 15% of the DVs for copper and magnesium, respectively.
In addition, it contains  prebiotic  fiber, which nourishes the friendly bacteria in your gut ( 53 ).
Cocoa powder and dark chocolate have significant antioxidant activity similar to that of fruit extracts from berries and cherries ( 54 ).
Studies have also shown that chocolate has beneficial effects on cholesterol and may reduce your risk of heart attacks and strokes ( 55 ,  56 ,  57 ).
However, not all chocolate is created equal. It’s believed that compounds called flavanols are responsible for chocolate’s benefits, and the flavanol content of dark chocolate is much higher than that of milk chocolate ( 58 ).
Therefore, it’s best to consume chocolate with a minimum of 70% cocoa to get the maximum benefits.
A small serving of dark chocolate contains 19% of the DV for iron along with several minerals and prebiotic fiber that promotes gut health.

12. Fish
Fish is a highly nutritious ingredient, and certain varieties like tuna are especially high in iron.
In fact, a 3-ounce (85-gram) serving of canned tuna contains about 1.4 mg of iron, which is approximately 8% of the DV ( 59 ).
Fish is also brimming with omega-3 fatty acids, which are a type of heart-healthy fat associated with a number of health benefits.
In particular, omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to promote brain health, enhance immune function, and support healthy growth and development ( 60 ).
Consult the EPA chart to see the healthiest choices of fish and minimize your exposure to mercury ( 7 ).
Fish also contains several other essential nutrients, including niacin, selenium, and vitamin B12 ( 61 ).
Besides tuna, haddock, mackerel, and sardines are a few other examples of iron-rich fish that you can also include in your diet ( 62 ,  63 ,  64 ).
A serving of canned tuna can provide about 8% of the DV for iron. Fish is also a good source of several other important nutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.

The bottom line
Iron is an important mineral that must be consumed regularly as your body cannot produce it on its own.
Yet, it should be noted that  some people  need to limit their intake of red meat and other foods high in heme iron.
However, most people are easily able to regulate the amount they absorb from food.
Remember that if you don’t eat meat or fish, you can boost absorption by including a source of vitamin C when eating plant sources of iron.
