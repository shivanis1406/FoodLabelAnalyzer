Title: 5 Emerging Benefits of Juniper Berries

Juniper berries have a tart, pine-like flavor, which people often use as a spice. Newer research suggests they may offer potential health benefits, but the evidence is limited.
The juniper tree, Juniperus communis, is an evergreen shrub that grows in many parts of the world, including North America, Europe, and Asia. It produces seed cones that are commonly known as juniper berries.
People have used these small berries for culinary and medicinal purposes since ancient times, and current research suggests that they may offer various health benefits.
Here are five potential benefits of juniper berries.

1. High in nutrients and powerful plant compounds
Though nutrition information on juniper berries is limited, they’re known to provide certain vitamins and an array of plant compounds.
Like many other berries,  they contain  vitamin C. This vitamin  is essential  for immune health, collagen synthesis, and blood vessel function. It also acts as an antioxidant, protecting your cells from damage caused by unstable molecules called free radicals.
Juniper berries contain plant compounds like flavonoid antioxidants, volatile oils, and coumarins.
The volatile oils in juniper berries contain substances known as monoterpenes. Research  has shown  these to have anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties.

2. Provide anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects
Antioxidant-rich foods  are important for health because they help protect your cells against damage. Juniper berries are rich in essential oils and flavonoids that function as potent antioxidants and may help reduce inflammation.
One  older 2014 study  detected over 70 compounds in juniper berry essential oil, with the monoterpenes alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, myrcene,  limonene , and sabinene making up the majority. The study found that the oil reduced cellular damage in yeast cells by increasing the activity of certain enzymes.
Another  test-tube study  showed that juniper berry essential oil significantly  reduced inflammation  in human skin cells. The researchers attributed this to the oil’s high concentration of monoterpenes.

3. May have antidiabetic properties
People used juniper berries in traditional medicine practices to treat  diabetes . More recent studies confirm that they may have antidiabetic properties.
Researchers believe these antidiabetic effects are due to the berries’ high concentration of antioxidants.  One study  on mice found that they helped reduce body weight and improve blood lipid profiles.
Though these findings are promising, research in humans is needed to confirm this potential health benefit.

4. Could promote heart health
Juniper berries may  promote heart health  by increasing HDL (good) cholesterol and reducing LDL (bad) cholesterol.
An  older 2007 study  in rats with diabetes demonstrated that treatment with juniper berry extract reduced total cholesterol and triglyceride levels by 57% and 37%, respectively, compared with a control group.
Though human studies are lacking,  research shows  that  eating berries  may reduce heart disease risk factors.
Until there’s more human research on the effects of juniper berries on heart health, it’s unknown whether eating these berries can reduce heart disease risk.

5. Antibacterial and antifungal activity
Test-tube and animal studies show that juniper berries have powerful antibacterial and antifungal properties.
One  test-tube study  found that juniper berry essential oil significantly inhibited the activity of three bacteria that can cause serious infections in humans — M. gordonae, M. avium, and M. intracellulare.
Extract from the berries  may also have  antibacterial effects against other bacteria, including mycobacteria. This type of germ can cause a range of diseases.
While it’s clear that juniper berries have antibacterial and antifungal properties, human studies are needed to examine whether their extract can be used to treat fungal or bacterial infections in people.

Juniper berry uses
Unlike other berries, people typically only use juniper berries in small amounts to flavor foods — they don’t usually eat them in large portions. For example, people may use juniper berries to add flavor to marinades and spice rubs and give gin its distinctive taste.
Keep in mind that there are many types of junipers, and not all are edible. People most frequently use berries from the Juniperus communis in food.
Juniper berry essential oil is also useful in aromatherapy and may be calming. It’s important to dilute them in a carrier oil before use. But you should not ingest essential oils.
Additionally, you can purchase juniper berry tea in tea bags or make it at home using crushed juniper berries.
You can purchase juniper berry supplements and extracts online and in certain health food stores. Because human studies are lacking, it’s unclear what dosage is most effective to reap their potential medicinal benefits.
These supplements are not appropriate for children or pregnant people. The supplements may also interact with certain medications, such as  diuretics  and psychiatric drugs.
Additionally, many online sources state that concentrated juniper berry supplements may  harm your kidneys , though no evidence supports these claims.
Nonetheless, considering the lack of human research on juniper berry supplements, it may be best to choose more thoroughly researched natural treatment options. Always speak with a doctor before trying a new supplement or home remedy.

The bottom line
Juniper berries are a popular ingredient in marinades, spice rubs, and specialty cocktails due to their aromatic flavor.
Animal and test-tube research has shown that extract from the berries may provide potential health benefits. It may have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and reduce blood sugar levels and heart disease risk factors.
However, due to the lack of human research on the potential medicinal effects of juniper berries and their supplements, their safety and effectiveness are largely unknown.
