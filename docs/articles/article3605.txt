Title: The Top 16 Health Benefits of Grapes

Grapes offer health benefits, primarily due to their high nutrient and antioxidant content. They may benefit the eye, heart, bones, and more.
People have cultivated grapes for thousands of years, including several ancient civilizations that revered them for their use in winemaking. Grapes also make a quick and delicious snack you can enjoy at home or on the go.
You may find them in various colors, including green, red, black, yellow, and pink. They come in multiple forms, too, from raisins to jellies to juice. Seeded and seedless varieties also exist.
Grapes offer a wealth of health benefits, primarily due to their high nutrient and antioxidant contents.
Here are the top 16 health benefits of grapes.

1. Packed with nutrients
Grapes are high in several important nutrients. Just 1 cup (151 grams) of red or green grapes provides ( 1 ):
Calories:  104
Carbs:  27 grams
Protein:  1 gram
Fat:  0.2 grams
Fiber:  1.4 grams
Copper:  21% of the daily value (DV)
Vitamin K:  18% of the DV
Thiamine (vitamin B1):  9% of the DV
Riboflavin  (vitamin B2) :  8% of the DV
Vitamin B6:  8% of the DV
Potassium:  6% of the DV
Vitamin C:  5% of the DV
Manganese:  5% of the DV
Vitamin E:  2% of the DV
As you can see, grapes are a rich source of copper and  vitamin K . Copper is an essential mineral involved in energy production, while vitamin K is vital for blood clotting and healthy bones ( 2 ,  3 ).
Grapes also provide good amounts of  B vitamins  like thiamine, riboflavin, and B6. Both thiamine and riboflavin are needed for growth and development, while B6 is mainly required for protein metabolism ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ).
Grapes contain many important vitamins and minerals, including copper and vitamins B and K.

2. May aid heart health
Grapes may boost heart health in several ways.
One cup (151 grams) of grapes contains 6% of the DV for  potassium . This mineral is necessary for maintaining healthy blood pressure levels ( 1 ,  7 ).
Evidence shows that potassium helps  lower blood pressure  primarily by helping dilate your arteries and veins. It may also help excrete sodium and prevent the narrowing of arteries and veins that would otherwise increase blood pressure ( 8 ).
However, a review of 32 studies determined that potassium intakes that are both too low and too high may lead to high blood pressure. Researchers advised sticking to the current daily intake recommendation of 4.7 grams ( 9 ).
Compounds found in grapes may  help protect against high cholesterol levels  by decreasing cholesterol absorption ( 10 ).
In an 8-week study in 69 people with high cholesterol, eating 3 cups (500 grams) of red grapes per day helped lower total and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. However, white grapes didn’t have the same effect ( 11 ).
Additionally, diets high in resveratrol — an antioxidant in grapes — such as the  Mediterranean diet  have been shown to decrease cholesterol levels ( 12 ).
Compounds in grapes may protect against heart disease by lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

3. High in antioxidants
Antioxidants are compounds that help repair the damage to your cells caused by free radicals — harmful molecules that cause oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is associated with several chronic health conditions, including diabetes, cancer, and heart disease ( 13 ).
Grapes are rich in several powerful  antioxidants . The highest concentration of antioxidants is found in the skin and seeds. However, multiple factors may affect their concentration, including grape variety, maturity, post-harvest storage, and environmental factors ( 14 ).
Interestingly enough, these beneficial compounds remain present even after fermentation, which is why wine is also an antioxidant source ( 14 ,  15 ).
Some grape varieties contain a higher content of anthocyanins, a class of flavonoids that give these fruits orange, red, blue, pink, and purple colors. Human and animal studies indicate that anthocyanins may help prevent or treat brain and heart diseases ( 14 ,  15 ).
Other important antioxidants in this fruit are  resveratrol  and quercetin, which may protect against heart disease, high blood sugar levels, and cancer ( 14 ,  16 ).
Grapes also contain vitamin C, beta carotene, lutein, and ellagic acid, which are also powerful antioxidants ( 14 ).
Grapes are rich in antioxidants, which are beneficial plant compounds that may protect against chronic health conditions.

4. May have anticancer effects
Antioxidants in grapes may protect against certain types of cancer ( 14 ).
Resveratrol, an antioxidant in this fruit, may help by reducing inflammation, acting as an antioxidant, and blocking the growth and spread of cancer cells in your body. In fact, it has been studied for its effects against numerous cancers ( 17 ,  18 ,  19 ,  20 ).
Grapes also contain quercetin, anthocyanin, and catechin antioxidants — all of which may have  cancer-fighting effects  ( 21 ).
Test-tube and animal studies show that grape extracts may block the growth and spread of human colon and breast cancer cells ( 22 ,  23 ,  24 ).
Additionally, a 2-week study in 30 people found that those over the age of 50 who ate 0.3–1 pound (150–450 grams) of grapes per day experienced decreased markers of colon cancer risk ( 25 ).
While more human studies are needed, a diet high in  antioxidant-rich foods , such as grapes, has been linked to lower cancer risk ( 26 ).
Antioxidants in grapes may prevent the growth and spread of multiple types of cancer, though human research is lacking.

5. May protect against diabetes and lower blood sugar levels
Grapes contain 23 grams of sugar per cup (151 grams), which may make you wonder if they’re a good choice for people with diabetes ( 1 ).
If you take a look at their  glycemic index (GI)  rating — a measure of how quickly a food raises your blood sugar — you’ll see that it ranges from 49–59, depending on grape variety ( 27 ,  28 ).
Similarly, the definition of low GI is variable depending on the source — some people consider under 55 as low, while others consider under 50 as low ( 27 ,  28 ).
This means that grapes’ GI score may range from low to medium, in which case they may raise your blood sugar levels at a slow or moderate pace but won’t necessarily spike it.
However, keep in mind that eating too much of a low GI food will have the same effect on blood sugars as eating a high GI food. So, it’s best to eat grapes in moderation.
In addition, compounds found in grapes may help improve markers of insulin response.
In a review of 29 studies in 1,297 adults, grapes and grape supplements significantly decreased what’s called homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), a measure of insulin resistance ( 29 ).
In particular, the compound resveratrol may improve your body’s ability to use insulin by ( 30 ,  31 ,  32 ):
decreasing insulin resistance
increasing insulin sensitivity
protecting your pancreas’s beta cells, which produce insulin
improving insulin production
increasing the number of glucose receptors on cell membranes
Managing your blood sugar levels over time is important for reducing your diabetes risk and preventing diabetes-related complications.
Though grapes are high in sugar, their low to moderate GI makes them fairly safe to eat in moderation if you have diabetes. Additionally, compounds in grapes may protect against high blood sugar.

6. May benefit eye health
Plant compounds in grapes may  protect against common eye diseases .
For instance, in a study in mice, those fed grapes showed fewer signs of damage to the retina and had better retina function than mice not given the fruit ( 33 ).
Additionally, in a test-tube study, resveratrol was found to protect retina cells in the human eye from ultraviolet A (UVA) light. This may lower your risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a common eye disease ( 34 ).
According to one review, resveratrol may also safeguard against glaucoma, cataracts, and diabetic eye disease ( 35 ).
Plus, grapes contain the antioxidants  lutein and zeaxanthin , which have been shown to help maintain eye health, improve visual performance, and prevent common age-related eye diseases ( 36 ,  37 ).
Grapes contain several compounds — such as resveratrol, lutein, and zeaxanthin — that may help prevent common eye diseases.

7. May improve memory, attention, and mood
Eating grapes may boost memory and  brain health .
In a 12-week study in 111 healthy older adults, taking 250 mg of a grape supplement daily significantly improved scores on a test measuring attention,  memory , and language, compared with baseline values ( 38 ).
Another study in healthy young adults showed that drinking 7.8 ounces (230 mL) of grape juice improved both mood and the speed of memory-related skills 20 minutes after consumption ( 39 ).
What’s more, in a study in rats, 4 weeks of resveratrol intake improved learning, memory, and mood. In addition, the rats’ brains showed signs of increased growth and blood flow ( 40 ).
Lastly, resveratrol may protect against Alzheimer’s disease by reducing brain inflammation and removing amyloid-beta peptide, the accumulation of which has been linked to this condition ( 41 ,  42 ).
Grapes contain compounds that may improve memory, attention, and mood, as well as protect against Alzheimer’s disease.

8. May support bone health
Grapes contain many minerals necessary for  bone health  — including potassium, manganese, and vitamins B, C, and K, which help prevent osteoporosis, a condition that leads to fragile bones ( 1 ,  43 ).
Additionally, animal and human studies demonstrate that resveratrol may improve bone density ( 44 ,  45 ,  46 ).
For example, in an 8-week study, rats fed freeze-dried grape powder had better bone absorption and calcium retention than rats that didn’t receive the powder ( 44 ).
Furthermore, a 2-year study in postmenopausal women showed that taking 75 mg of resveratrol twice daily improved bone mineral density and slowed bone loss, reducing the risk of major fractures and hip fractures ( 46 ).
However, human studies are currently lacking.
Grapes contain vitamins and minerals important for bone health, although more research is needed in humans.

9. May protect against bacteria and fungi
Several compounds in grapes may protect against harmful microorganisms ( 4 7 ,  48 ).
For example, resveratrol has antimicrobial properties that inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi like  Campylobacter jejuni  and  Candida albicans  ( 49 ).
It may also protect against  foodborne illnesses . When added to various types of food, resveratrol helps prevent the growth of harmful bacteria, such as  E. coli  ( 49 ,  50 ).
Other compounds in grapes with antimicrobial activity include anthocyanins, which may destroy bacterial cell walls ( 51 ).
Lastly, grapes are a good source of  vitamin C , which is well known for its immune system benefits ( 1 ,  52 ).
Grapes contain several compounds that may have beneficial effects against harmful bacteria and fungi.

10. May slow signs of aging and promote longevity
Plant compounds in grapes may affect aging and  lifespan .
Research shows that resveratrol may delay signs of aging by mimicking the beneficial effects of calorie restriction, such as reducing oxidative stress, enhancing stress resistance, and improving inflammatory response ( 53 ,  54 ).
Keep in mind that these benefits have only been seen in animal studies.
In addition, resveratrol activates the SirT1 gene, which is activated by  low calorie diets  and has been linked to longer lifespans ( 55 ,  56 ).
Resveratrol also activates sirtuin, a protein that regulates cellular processes like aging and cell death ( 57 ).
Resveratrol, which is found in grapes, has been shown to activate genes associated with slower signs of aging and longer lifespan.

11. May lower inflammation
While low level inflammation is a typical bodily response, chronic inflammation plays a key role in the development of long-term health conditions like cancer, heart disease, diabetes,  arthritis , and autoimmune disorders ( 58 ).
Notably, anthocyanin and resveratrol compounds in grapes have been linked to powerful  anti-inflammatory  properties ( 51 ,  59 ).
Research shows that both compounds can suppress the expression of inflammatory markers like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) ( 60 ,  61 ).
Yet, studies involving grapes themselves are lacking.
Grapes contain compounds with anti-inflammatory effects, which may in turn protect against chronic diseases.

12. May benefit skin and hair health
Resveratrol may have numerous protective effects on your skin and hair.
In fact, this compound has gained popularity in cosmetic products because it penetrates the skin barrier and increases collagen concentration, as well as protects against UV damage from sun exposure ( 62 ,  63 ).
Animal studies show that resveratrol’s effect on  collagen production  may promote faster wound healing ( 63 ).
Because oxidative stress and inflammation play a role in hair loss, research suggests that resveratrol may also promote  hair growth  ( 64 ).
For starters, resveratrol protects hair follicles from environmental damage. It also promotes the rapid increase of important follicular cells that encourage hair growth ( 64 ).
Nevertheless, studies on the effects of grape consumption on skin and hair are lacking.
The antioxidant resveratrol in grapes may protect your skin from damage and promote hair growth but more research is needed.

13. May have anti-obesity effects
Obesity  may increase your risk of multiple health conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer ( 65 ).
Notably, anthocyanins in grapes may have anti-obesity effects. Studies in rats fed a high fat diet show that anthocyanins may suppress body weight gain and reduce liver fat content ( 60 ).
Additionally, research in animals found that proanthocyanidin extract from grape seed may increase levels of the fullness hormone GLP-1, which may lower appetite and reduce food intake ( 65 ).
Nonetheless, human studies are lacking.
Antioxidants in grapes may combat obesity by inhibiting appetite and preventing weight gain. However, research in humans is lacking.

14. May relieve constipation
Constipation involves passing stool less often than usual and feelings of incomplete evacuation ( 66 ,  67 ).
Dietary changes like increasing fiber and fluid intake are  essential to treatment , since dehydration is a common secondary cause of constipation ( 67 ).
Fiber  in whole fruits like grapes may significantly improve constipation symptoms by reducing the time it takes stool to move through your colon, as well as increasing fecal weight and daily bowel movements, compared with fruit juices ( 68 ).
Additionally, grapes are 81% water, so they may help you reach your hydration goals ( 1 ).
As a good source of water and fiber, grapes may help relieve constipation.

15. May support sleep
Evidence suggests a direct link between diet and sleep ( 69 ).
In fact, studies have determined that grapes are a natural source of  melatonin , a sleep-promoting hormone that regulates your sleep-wake cycle ( 69 ,  70 ,  71 ).
Interestingly enough, melatonin is found mainly in grape skin, which is why it’s also present in products like grape juice and wine ( 69 ).
Since melatonin works hand-in-hand with your internal clock, intake timing is an essential factor to consider. If you’re eating grapes to  help you sleep , aim to consume them early in the evening.
Grapes are a natural source of melatonin, a hormone that may improve your sleep quality.

16. Easy to add to your diet
Grapes are delicious, versatile, and easy to incorporate into a healthy diet. Here are a few ways to enjoy them:
Eat grapes by themselves as a morning or afternoon snack.
Blend with spinach, cucumber, banana, kale, and mint for a nutrient-rich  smoothie .
Serve on top of your favorite yogurt with crushed nuts and a drizzle of honey.
Enjoy frozen grapes as a refreshing summer treat.
Toss chopped grapes on your  salad  of choice.
Pair with sliced apples, strawberries, and dark chocolate for a sweet but healthy dessert.
Drink 100% grape juice.
Enjoy red wine in moderation.
Grapes are easy to snack on or add to your meals. Grape juice and red wine — in moderation — may provide benefits as well.

Fresh grapes fruit vs. grape juice
Both grapes and grape juice share multiple health benefits, but the whole fruit is generally healthier.
That’s partly because the production process for grape juice — which includes heating the juice to avoid fermentation — may reduce its antioxidant content by 44% ( 72 ,  73 ).
In addition, fruit juices provide little to no fiber compared with whole fruits, as well as a higher sugar content.
Evidence shows that diets that include whole fruits instead of  juice  are more effective for weight management for the following reasons ( 68 ):
a slower rise in blood sugar levels, which prevents your blood sugar and insulin levels from spiking and crashing
delayed stomach emptying, which increases feelings of fullness and reduces food intake
In addition, evidence shows that only about 5% of Americans meet the  recommended fiber intake , which is 38 and 25 grams daily for men and women, respectively ( 74 ).
So, you should aim to eat fresh grapes rather than drink grape juice whenever possible.
While whole grapes and grape juice provide multiple nutrients, eating fresh fruit ensures a higher intake of fiber and antioxidants, plus a lower sugar intake.

Does wine provide health benefits?
Like whole grapes and grape juice, wine is a good source of antioxidants and offers numerous health benefits ( 75 ).
In fact, research shows that  moderate wine intake  may protect against heart disease, diabetes, and even cancer ( 75 ,  76 ,  77 ).
However, keep in mind that  heavy drinking  — defined as more than four drinks per day — is associated with an increased risk of death and heart disease ( 78 ,  79 ).
Current U.S. dietary guidelines recommend limiting your alcohol intake to 1 drink per day for women and 2 drinks per day for men. For reference, every 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine equals 1 drink ( 79 ).
Nevertheless, while moderate wine intake may positively affect your health, like grape juice, it lacks whole grapes’ fiber content.
Like whole grapes, wine is a good source of antioxidants, and it offers multiple health benefits. However, excessive intake may lead to detrimental health effects.

The bottom line
Grapes offer several important nutrients and powerful plant compounds that benefit your health. Though they contain sugar, they don’t appear to negatively impact blood sugar control when eaten in moderation.
Antioxidants like  resveratrol  provide most of grapes’ benefits, including their anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetes, and anticancer properties.
They are also quite delicious and easy to add to your diet. For the most benefits, choose fresh grapes over  grape juice  or wine.
Try this today:  If you want your grapes to last up to 14 days, choose the ones with a green stem and store them in an airtight container at the back of your fridge, which is usually the chilliest spot.
