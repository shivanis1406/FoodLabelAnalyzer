Title: 20 Foods That Are High in Vitamin C

Food sources high in vitamin C — a key vitamin for your health — include citrus fruits, certain types of cherries and peppers, and fresh parsley.
Vitamin C  is a water-soluble vitamin that’s found in many foods, particularly fruits and vegetables. It functions as an  antioxidant  in your body.
This vitamin  supports  many processes in your body, including:
immune function
neurotransmitter production
collagen synthesis
cardiovascular health
wound healing
Additionally, vitamin C is  vital  for connective tissue, bone, and tooth health.
The current  Daily Value (DV)  for vitamin C is 90 milligrams (mg) for men and 75 mg for women.
Symptoms of vitamin C deficiency  include  higher susceptibility to:
bleeding gums
frequent bruising  and infections
poor wound healing
anemia
scurvy
For the purposes of this article, we have used the DV of 90 mg to calculate the percentage of the DV for each food below.

Which food is highest in vitamin C?
Here are 20 foods that are high in vitamin C.

1. Kakadu plums
The  Kakadu plum  ( Terminalia ferdinandiana ) is an Australian native  superfood  containing 100 times more vitamin C than oranges.
It has the highest known concentration of vitamin C of any food, containing up to 2,907 mg per 100 grams (g).
Just  one plum  (about 15 g) packs 436 mg of vitamin C, which is 484% of the DV.
It’s also rich in  potassium ,  vitamin E , and the antioxidant  lutein , which may benefit  eye health .
