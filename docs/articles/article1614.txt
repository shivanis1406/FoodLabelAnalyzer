Title: Can Magnesium Help Relieve Menopause Symptoms?

Magnesium is important as you age, including during menopause. Good sources of magnesium include avocados, almonds, bananas, broccoli, and cashews.
Magnesium is an important mineral in your body, especially as you get older.
This nutrient  helps support  healthy bones and hormone levels and  may affect  your moods. It’s also involved in many biochemical reactions throughout your body.
As you approach menopause, magnesium becomes particularly important for good health and may even help reduce menopause symptoms.
This article covers everything you need to know about magnesium and menopause, including its benefits, its possible side effects, and ways to get more of it in your diet.

Menopause and health
Menopause is a natural phase of life that  often begins  around 51 years of age. But it can begin years earlier or later, anytime from about age 45 to 56 years.
During  menopause , you may experience signs and symptoms such as  hot flashes , difficulty sleeping, weight gain, reductions in bone and muscle mass, and hormonal changes.
Because maintaining a moderate weight and maintaining strong bones and muscles are beneficial for your health, it’s important to address these issues early on in menopause.

Magnesium and bone health
About 60%  of the  magnesium in your body is stored in your bones, where it  plays a crucial role  in preventing osteoporosis, or low bone mineral density.
According to research cited in a  2023 review , almost 1 in 3 postmenopausal women 50 years old and older may experience bone fractures due to lower bone density.
Bones become stronger through a natural remodeling process known as osteogenesis. During this process, bones are broken down by osteoclasts and then rebuilt by osteoblasts. In younger people, bones are rebuilt more quickly and more effectively.
During menopause,  estrogen levels decline , leading to a spike in osteoclast activity (bone loss). As a result, bones are broken down more quickly than they’re rebuilt, and they become weakened and porous.
Magnesium deficiency is  associated  with osteoporosis because magnesium plays an important role in cartilage and bone matrix calcification, or increased bone strength. Magnesium deficiency is  also linked  to lower activity of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D, both of which are crucial for bone development.
Since magnesium plays a key role in bone health, maintaining adequate magnesium levels may slow down the rate of bone loss.

May improve sleep
Varying degrees of sleep issues, including  insomnia , are  common  during menopause.
In a  2023 review  of 41 studies going back decades, the authors concluded that, on average, just over 51% of postmenopausal women experience sleep disorders. According to studies cited in the review, people in perimenopause and postmenopause experience these sleep-related issues more often than those who are in the premenopause phase.
The results of a  2012 study  in 46 older adults suggest that magnesium levels may affect your body’s circadian rhythms (your body’s natural clock).
And a  2024 study  notes that magnesium helps increase muscle relaxation and that increasing magnesium levels — through either supplements or food — may help promote better sleep.
But more robust research is needed.

May lower your risk of depression and anxiety
Depression  is a common symptom among perimenopausal and postmenopausal people. Although many factors can affect your chances of experiencing depression, maintaining adequate magnesium levels may help relieve depressive symptoms.
According to a  2023 review  of clinical studies, adding magnesium supplements may help with depression and related symptoms.
Magnesium plays a key role in brain function, mood regulation, and stress response, which may affect the progression and onset of depression and anxiety.
Older adults are at an  increased risk  of magnesium deficiency. If you’re going through menopause or approaching the expected age of menopause, it may be even more important to get enough magnesium from food or a supplement.
Though existing research is promising, most researchers agree that more is needed. You should always consult a healthcare professional, and possibly a dietitian, for guidance on any supplements or dietary changes that might affect your magnesium levels.
If you’re experiencing depression or high anxiety levels, you might also want to consider working with a mental health professional to manage these conditions.

Supports heart health
According to the American Heart Association, heart disease is the  leading cause of death  in women, and the risk of developing heart disease increases after menopause.
Though menopause does not cause heart disease, postmenopausal women are at an increased risk of  high blood pressure , high triglycerides, and high levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol due to factors such as decreased estrogen levels, stress, increasing age, and unhealthy lifestyle habits.
What’s more, lower magnesium levels  are linked  to some heart health conditions.
Some research indicates that high magnesium levels  are associated  with lower inflammatory markers related to heart disease, which indicate better heart health.
Magnesium helps control heart muscle contractions and nerve impulses, allowing for a healthy heartbeat.
Considering that older adults are at a  higher risk  of low magnesium levels, it’s important for older adults who have gone through menopause to pay attention to this mineral to support their heart health. But be sure to speak with a healthcare professional before starting a magnesium supplement.

Risks and side effects
Excess magnesium intake  from food does not pose a serious threat to health, as your body can excrete any excess through urine. Your body tightly regulates magnesium when levels get too high or too low.
Possible side effects of taking magnesium supplements or consuming too much magnesium  include :
diarrhea
nausea and upset stomach
flatulence
abdominal pain
respiratory issues
Though magnesium toxicity is rare in generally healthy people, it can occur in those with reduced kidney function and may cause heart irregularities, muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, and even kidney failure.
Consult a healthcare professional before trying a magnesium supplement or if you experience any symptoms or possible side effects after adding magnesium supplements to your daily routine.

Sources of magnesium
Magnesium is essential for good health and is safe to consume in foods and in supplement form. The National Institutes of Health recommends that females 31 years old and older consume  320 milligrams  of magnesium per day from food or a supplement.
Magnesium is found in many foods and  supplements  available over the counter or online. Food sources of magnesium include:
almonds
avocados
bananas
beans (black, red, white)
broccoli
cashews
dark chocolate
fish, such as halibut, mackerel, and salmon
leafy greens, such as spinach and Swiss chard
nuts, such as almonds or cashews
oatmeal
seeds, such as pumpkin, sesame, and sunflower
soybeans
tofu
whole grains, including whole grain breads and pastas and brown rice
Despite the many magnesium-rich foods available, most people  do not get enough  magnesium through their diet. This is mostly due to the reliance on overly processed foods and a lower intake of beans, lentils, vegetables, and whole grains.
Consult a healthcare professional before changing your diet to add more magnesium or trying a supplement.

Takeaway
Magnesium plays a vital role in health throughout your life, especially as you get older. It may be beneficial to your health during menopause,  helping to keep your bones strong and reduce your risk of osteoporosis. It may also reduce some side effects of menopause, such as difficulty sleeping and depression , while supporting heart health.
Most menopausal people have inadequate magnesium levels, which put them at greater risk of unfavorable health outcomes. But magnesium can be found in many foods, such as dark chocolate, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, leafy greens, and whole grains.
You can also easily purchase magnesium supplements over the counter or online. They’re considered safe for most people, but be sure to consult a healthcare professional before adding one to your routine.
