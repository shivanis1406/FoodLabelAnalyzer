Title: 9 Benefits and Side Effects of Coenzyme Q10 (COQ10)

CoQ10 may help support the skin, brain, and lungs and protect against chronic diseases like cancer and type 2 diabetes. More research is needed to understand the possible benefits.
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a compound that helps generate energy in your cells. Your body produces less of it with age, but you can also get it from food or supplements.
Low levels of CoQ10 may be associated with diseases like cancer, type 2 diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. Whether the relationship is based on cause and effect is still unclear.
Here’s what you need to know about its nine potential benefits and safety information.

What is CoQ10?
CoQ10 is found throughout the body, with the highest levels in the heart, liver, kidney, and pancreas. It helps generate energy in cells by making the antioxidant adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is involved in cell energy transfer. It also serves as an antioxidant to protect cells against  oxidative stress .
Ubiquinol is the reduced form of CoQ10, while ubiquinone is the oxidized form. The body converts it back and forth between both forms. While both exist in the body, ubiquinol is most common in blood circulation.
Oxidative stress , or cell damage caused by free radicals, can interfere with regular cell functioning and may contribute to many health conditions. Some chronic diseases are also associated with low levels of CoQ10.
CoQ10 production  decreases  as you age. Thus, older people can be deficient in this compound.
Possible causes of low CoQ10 levels include:
genetic defects in how the body creates and uses CoQ10
increased demands by tissues as a consequence of disease
mitochondrial diseases
oxidative stress due to aging
side effects of  statin treatments

CoQ10 may help treat heart failure
Research  suggests that CoQ10 may improve treatment outcomes for people with heart failure.
According to a  review of research , CoQ10 may potentially be beneficial for managing hea rt failure when used alongside other treatments. However, more research is still needed. Research cited in the review suggests that people with heart failure who took CoQ10 supplements had a decreased risk of dying or being hospitalized and a greater improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction compared to those who took a  placebo .
CoQ10 could also help restore optimal energy production levels and reduce oxidative damage, which can aid the treatment of heart failure.
However, no conclusive evidence supports or refutes the use of CoQ10 for people with heart failure. More research is still needed.

CoQ10 may help with fertility
Female fertility decreases with age due to a decline in the number and quality of available eggs.
CoQ10 is directly involved in this process. As you age, CoQ10 production slows, making the body less effective at protecting the eggs from oxidative damage.
Supplementing with CoQ10 may help maintain egg quality and  reverse  this age-related decline in egg quality and quantity.
Male fertility is also susceptible to oxidative damage, which may result in reduced sperm count, poor sperm quality, and infertility.
Several studies  suggest supplementing with CoQ10 may improve sperm activity and concentration by increasing antioxidant protection.

CoQ10 may support skin health as you age
Harmful elements like cellular damage or a hormonal imbalance can lead to reduced skin moisture and protection from environmental aggressors, as well as the thinning of the layers of the skin.
According to  human  and  animal studies , applying CoQ10 directly to the skin may help reduce oxidative damage caused by UV rays, decrease the depth of wrinkles, and promote antioxidant protection.

CoQ10 may reduce migraine
Abnormal mitochondrial function can result in low energy in the brain cells. It may contribute to  migraine , a neurological disease characterized by headache and  other symptoms , like noise and light sensitivity.
CoQ10 lives mainly in the mitochondria of the cells and  may benefit  the treatment of migraine.
One  review of six studies  found that CoQ10 may effectively reduce the severity, duration, and frequency of migraine episodes in adults with migraine.

CoQ10 may benefit exercise performance
Abnormal mitochondrial function can reduce muscle energy, making it hard for muscles to contract efficiently and sustain exercise.
CoQ10  may help  exercise performance by decreasing cell oxidative stress and improving mitochondrial function.
Moreover, supplementing with CoQ10  may help reduce fatigue , potentially improving exercise performance.

CoQ10 may help with diabetes management
Oxidative stress can cause cell damage, resulting in metabolic diseases like diabetes and  insulin resistance .
A  2024 meta-analysis  suggests CoQ10 may help improve insulin sensitivity and regulate blood sugar levels.
Not only that, but it also may reduce markers of oxidative stress compared to a placebo.

CoQ10 may play a role in cancer prevention
CoQ10 may reduce oxidative stress, which may be involved in cancer development. Though more research is needed, some studies also show that low levels of CoQ10 could be linked to an increased risk of certain types of cancer.
According to  some test-tube studies , CoQ10 may block the growth of cancer cells. Interestingly, people with cancer tend to have lower levels of CoQ10.
Some older studies suggest low levels of CoQ10 may be associated with a higher risk of certain types of cancer, including  breast  and  prostate cancer .  Newer studies  have also suggested this with regard to lung cancer.
However, the  National Institutes of Health (NIH)  states that CoQ10 has not been shown to be of value as a cancer treatment, so more research needs to be conducted before making a definitive claim.

CoQ10 may benefit brain health
Mitochondrial function tends to decrease with age, which can lead to the death of brain cells and contribute to conditions like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.
The brain is  susceptible to oxidative stress  due to its high fatty acid content and oxygen demand.
This oxidative stress enhances the production of  harmful compounds  that could affect memory, cognition, and physical functions.  Research from 2024  links low levels of CoQ10 in the blood with increased neurotoxicity due to the buildup of certain proteins in the brain.
CoQ10 may reduce harmful compounds, possibly slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, according to some animal studies in  2019  and  2021 .
However, more research on humans is  still needed  to support the potential benefits.

CoQ10 may have a protective effect on the lungs
Increased oxidative damage in the lungs and reduced antioxidant protection, including low levels of CoQ10, can result in lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma.
Furthermore,  research from 2021  has found that people with these conditions tend to have higher levels of oxidized CoQ10 in the lungs, which indicates increased oxidative stress.
Another study  found that supplementing with CoQ10 and creatine, a compound found in muscle cells, may have improved functional performance, perception of shortness of breath, and body composition in people with COPD.

How much CoQ10 should I take?
CoQ10 is well-tolerated and is not associated with any serious side effects. It comes in two different forms: ubiquinol and ubiquinone.
Current studies  note no significant difference between ubiquinol and ubiquinone regarding absorption.
You can find CoQ10 supplements in various doses, ranging from  30 to 600 mg , though it’s best to use only as directed.
Studies related to heart healt h typically use doses of 100 to 400 mg per day, while doses ranging from 600 to 3,000 mg have been used to treat some neurodegenerative disorders.
However, taking  200 mg  twice daily with food is considered the average dosage needed to maintain therapeutic blood levels of CoQ10 for most people.
Because CoQ10 is a fat-soluble compound, its absorption is slow and limited. However, taking CoQ10 supplements with food can help your body absorb it better. Also, soft-gel capsules absorb  more efficiently  than other forms of CoQ10.
Additionally, some products offer a broken-down form of CoQ10 or a combination of CoQ10 and oils to improve absorption.

Can I get CoQ10 from food?
While you can easily consume CoQ10 as a supplement, you can also eat it in certain foods.
The following foods  contain CoQ10 :
Organ meats:   heart, liver, and kidney
Some muscle meats:  pork, beef, and chicken
Fatty fish:  trout, herring, mackerel, and sardines
Legumes:  soybeans, lentils, and peanuts
Nuts and seeds:  sesame seeds and pistachios
Oils:  soybean and canola oil
In addition to the foods listed above, some types of fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and cereals also contain CoQ10, though in much lower amounts.

Frequently asked questions
Supplementing with CoQ10 appears to be well tolerated by humans, even in  doses up to 1,200 mg . However, it’s best to use it only as directed.
You may experience some insomnia or indigestion, and you should not take it if you are also taking blood thinning medications like  warfarin  (Coumadin, Jantoven) and certain cancer medications.
CoQ10 may reduce the effectiveness of warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) and interact with some blood pressure and cancer medications.
There isn’t much research on CoQ10’s interaction with other vitamin supplements. Available  research  suggests that it’s probably safe and even beneficial. However, it’s still a good idea to speak to your doctor before trying CoQ10 and inform them about any medications or other supplements you are taking.

The bottom line
CoQ10 is a fat-soluble, vitamin-like compound that may have some health benefits.
Research suggests it may help improve heart health and blood sugar regulation, protect against certain types of cancer, and reduce migraine frequency.
It may also reduce the oxidative damage that leads to muscle fatigue, skin damage, and brain and lung diseases. However, more research is necessary to determine whether CoQ10 is effective in these areas.
You can buy CoQ10 as a supplement. Though people generally tolerate CoQ10 well, it’s best to talk with your doctor before trying it or any other supplement. You can also increase your CoQ10 intake through various food sources, including:
organ and muscle meats
oils
nuts
seeds
legumes
If you choose to take a supplement, be sure to choose one that is  high quality and vetted by a third party  to ensure its safety.
