Menu options
Here’s a closer look at the menu for each service.
Blue Apron offers a large rotating menu with 10–12 weekly options. You view items on their Signature, Signature for 4, and Vegetarian for 2 menus, then choose which recipes to add to your plan.
Here are some examples of Blue Apron meals:
Roasted  Sweet Potato  Quesadillas with Creamy Guacamole
Seared Steaks & Thyme Butter with Oven Fries & Lemon Aioli
Peanut Lentil Curry with Fried Eggs & Garlic Naan
Southern-Spiced Chicken with  Buttermilk  Mashed Potatoes & Green Beans
Entrées that are  approved by WW (formerly Weight Watchers) , vegetarian, low calorie, or carb-conscious are labeled on each menu. You can also view the ingredient list, nutritional information, and step-by-step recipe for each dish online.
Sunbasket boasts an extensive rotating menu, with around 17 dinner meal kits and 9 oven-ready options per week.
You can filter items that contain gluten, soy, or dairy, as well as view meals that are vegan,  paleo , diabetes-friendly, or low in calories.
A few dinner examples include:

Mojo Pork Tacos with Pickled Onions and Salsa Verde
Mini Rosemary-Potato Pizzas with Fresh Mozzarella and Mushrooms
Sunbasket also offers an assortment of breakfast, lunch, and snack options, which you can add to your order for an additional fee. Unlike the meal kits, these are typically premade and include choices like egg bites, ramen bowls, empanadas, and  overnight oats .

Cost and shipping
Here’s how much you can expect to pay for each service.
Blue Apron’s cost depends on the plan you choose and how many servings you order.
Most menus cost $9.99 per serving, including the Signature, Vegetarian for 2, and Wellness for 2 plans. The Signature for 4 plan is slightly cheaper, ranging from $7.49–$8.99 per serving depending on the number of recipes you select each week.
Most plans include free shipping within the contiguous United States. However, if you only order 2 recipes per week on the Signature, Vegetarian for 2, or Wellness for 2 plans, there’s a $7.99 delivery fee.
Like Blue Apron, the price of Sunbasket depends on how many servings you choose and which type of meals you select.
Fresh & Ready meals, which require minimal preparation, range from $8.99–$11.99 per serving. Meanwhile, Sunbasket meal kits cost $10.99–$13.99 per serving.
Optional add-ons vary in price depending on the specific items you select.
Sunbasket is available throughout most of the contiguous United States, excluding Montana, North Dakota, and parts of New Mexico. The shipping fee is calculated based on your location.

Effectiveness for weight loss
Both Blue Apron and Sunbasket provide meals that may benefit weight loss.
Although none of Blue Apron’s plans specifically target weight loss, many of its options may help you lose weight.
For example, Blue Apron has numerous WW-approved meals that are rich in nutrient-dense  veggies  and low in calories, saturated fat, added sugar, and sodium.
The company also labels all meals that contain fewer than 600 calories, which may help you  curb your calorie intake  ( 1 ).
Furthermore, Blue Apron encourages members to prepare more meals at home. Research indicates that people who eat home-cooked meals frequently tend to have less body fat and better diet quality than those who rarely cook at home ( 2 ,  3 ).
Sunbasket provides a wide selection of meals that are low in calories to help you decrease your calorie intake, thereby promoting weight loss ( 1 ).
All meals are also  high in protein , which has been shown to support appetite control and reduce food intake. Plus, all meals contain at least 5 grams of fiber, which moves slowly through your body to help keep you feeling full ( 4 ,  5 ).
What’s more, Sunbasket tailors to several eating patterns associated with weight loss, including low carb, paleo, vegetarian, and  Mediterranean  diets ( 6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ).
Like Blue Apron, Sunbasket makes it easy to enjoy more healthy, home-cooked meals, which is associated with decreased body fat and improved diet quality ( 2 ,  3 )

Other benefits
Both services offer several other benefits beyond weight loss.
All Blue Apron meals feature fresh, high quality ingredients and are free of  genetically modified organisms (GMOs) .
Blue Apron also partners with family-run suppliers to  support sustainability  and provides detailed information on ingredient sourcing on its website. Additionally, the company uses mostly recyclable packaging and provides detailed recycling directions online.
Plus, Blue Apron is cheaper than many similar services and may be a good option for those on a budget.
Sunbasket uses high quality ingredients in all of its entrées, including  organic  produce, responsibly raised meat that’s free of hormones and antibiotics, and sustainably sourced seafood.
All entrées are also dietitian-approved, low in sodium, and rich in  fiber  and protein.
Unlike other similar services, Sunbasket provides breakfast and lunch options, as well as an assortment of snacks. The company also offers meals that require varying levels of preparation, which may benefit those who don’t have time to cook during the week.
Additionally, all packaging is reusable, recyclable, or compostable, and most of it is made from recyclable materials.

Downsides
There are also a few drawbacks to consider when selecting which service is right for you.
While Blue Apron provides options for several dietary restrictions, there are limited choices for those following other diets. In particular, it may not be suitable for those following vegan, gluten-free,  keto , or paleo diets.
Because all meal kits are manufactured in a facility that also processes many  common food allergens , it’s also not recommended for those with severe food allergies.
Additionally, it isn’t a good choice for people who prefer to eat organic.
Sunbasket costs more than many other meal services and is somewhat pricey, depending on the specific plan and meals you select.
It’s also unsuitable for people with serious food allergies, as meals are packaged in a facility that handles many major allergens. In fact, even Sunbasket’s gluten-free plan shouldn’t be used by those with  celiac disease  or gluten sensitivity due to the risk of cross contamination.
Furthermore, options for more restrictive eating patterns, such as  vegan  or keto diets, are limited compared with other services.

The bottom line
Blue Apron and Sunbasket are two meal delivery services that aim to help ease meal prep, regardless of your culinary skills.
Although  Blue Apron  is one of the most affordable options, it offers fewer choices and may not be a good fit for everyone.
On the other hand,  Sunbasket  is slightly more expensive but caters to a wider range of diets and provides both meal kits and oven-ready dishes.
