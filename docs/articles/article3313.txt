Title: Lychees 101: Nutrition Facts and Health Benefits



Lychee, litchi, and lichee all refer to the same tropical fruit that offers healthy vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Adding this fruit into your diet is a healthy choice.
The lychee ( Litchi chinensis ) — also known as litchi or lichee — is a small tropical fruit from the soapberry family.
Other popular fruits in this family include rambutan and longan.
Lychees are grown in subtropical regions throughout the world and especially popular in their native China, as well as Southeast Asia.
Known for their sweet and flowery flavor, they’re typically eaten fresh and sometimes used in ice creams or processed into juice, wine, sherbert, and jelly.
They’re a good source of several vitamins, minerals, and healthy antioxidants.
Lychees have an inedible, pink-red, leathery skin, which is removed before consumption. The flesh is white and surrounds a dark seed in the center.

Nutrition Facts
Lychees are mainly composed of water and  carbs  — which make up 82% and 16.5% of the fruit, respectively ( 1 ).
A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of fresh lychees provides the following nutrients. The table below shows the main nutrients in fresh lychees ( 1 ):
Calories:  66
Protein:  0.8 grams
Carbs:  16.5 grams
Sugar:  15.2 grams
Fiber:  1.3 grams
Fat:  0.4 grams
Besides water, lychees are mainly composed of carbs.
A single lychee — either fresh or dried — contains 1.5–1.7 grams of carbs ( 1 ).
The majority of the carbs in lychees comes from sugars, which are responsible for their sweet taste. They’re relatively low in  fiber .
Lychees are a decent source of several vitamins and minerals, including:
Vitamin C:  The most abundant vitamin in lychees. One lychee provides around 9% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for  vitamin C  ( 1 ).
Copper:  Lychees are a decent source of copper. Inadequate copper intake may have adverse effects on heart health ( 2 ).
Potassium:  An essential nutrient that may improve  heart health  when eaten in sufficient amounts ( 3 ).
Lychees are primarily composed of water and carbs, most of which are sugars. Compared to many other fruits, they’re low in fiber. They’re also high in vitamin C and offer decent amounts of copper and potassium.

Other Plant Compounds
Like other fruits, lychees are a good source of various  antioxidant  plant compounds.
In fact, they have been reported to contain higher levels of antioxidant polyphenols than several other common fruits ( 4 ).
Antioxidants in lychees include:
Epicatechin:  A flavonoid that may improve heart health and reduce your risk of cancer and diabetes ( 5 ,  6 ).
Rutin:  A flavonoid which may help protect against chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease ( 6 ,  7 ).
Oligonol is a dietary supplement that is often mentioned in connection to lychees.
It’s a patented mixture of antioxidants (proanthocyanidins) derived from lychee skin and  green tea , developed by the Amino Up Chemical Corporation in Japan.
The antioxidants are chemically altered to increase their uptake from your gut ( 8 ).
Several studies indicate that Oligonol may reduce  abdominal fat , fatigue, and inflammation after exercise ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ,  12 ).
However, as it’s not found naturally in lychee fruits, its health effects don’t apply to lychees.
Like most fruits and vegetables, lychees are a good source of antioxidants and other healthy plant compounds. These include epicatechin and rutin. Fresh lychees don’t contain any Oligonol, as is often claimed.

Possible Health Benefits
The health effects of lychees have not been studied yet.
However, including a variety of fruits and vegetables in your diet may improve your health and reduce your risk of several chronic diseases ( 13 ,  14 ,  15 ).
Lychees contain several healthy minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants, such as potassium, copper, vitamin C, epicatechin, and rutin. These may help protect against heart disease,  cancer , and diabetes ( 3 ,  6 ,  7 ,  16 ).
Animal studies also indicate that lychee extract may help fight liver cancer ( 17 ).
Still, further studies are needed to confirm the health benefits of lychees in humans.
The health effects of lychees have not been studied directly. However, they contain several nutrients and antioxidants that are important for health.

Adverse Effects and Individual Concerns
When eaten in moderation as a part of a  healthy diet , lychees do not have any known adverse health effects.
However, lychees have been associated with brain inflammation in South and Southeast Asia.
Whether lychees are responsible is not entirely clear, but scientists have hypothesized that the toxin hypoglycin A may be responsible. Further studies are needed ( 18 ,  19 ).
Additionally, lychees may cause an allergic reaction in rare cases ( 18 ).
Though lychees have been associated with brain inflammation in parts of Asia, it’s uncertain that they’re the culprit. Eating lychees in moderation should be safe for most people.

The Bottom Line
Lychees are popular in Southeast Asia and China but less common in other countries.
They have a sweet and flowery flavor and are a good source of vitamin C and several beneficial antioxidants. This makes them an excellent addition to a healthy diet.
