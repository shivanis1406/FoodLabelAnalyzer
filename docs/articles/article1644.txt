Title: The 15 Best Foods to Eat Before Drinking Alcohol

Before drinking, you may want to eat foods high in protein, electrolytes, and other key nutrients.
What you eat before drinking alcohol can have a huge impact on how you feel at the end of the night — and the next morning.
In fact, picking the right foods before you indulge in an alcoholic beverage or two can help control hunger, balance electrolytes, and decrease some of the adverse effects associated with alcohol.
Conversely, selecting other foods can end up causing bloating, dehydration, heartburn, and indigestion.
Here are the 15 best foods to eat before drinking.

1. Eggs
Eggs are highly nutritious and  filling , packing 6 grams (g) of protein per egg ( 1 ).
Snacking on  protein-rich foods  like eggs before drinking alcohol can help slow the emptying of your stomach and delay alcohol absorption ( 2 ,  3 ).
Plus, protein is the most filling macronutrient, keeping you feeling fuller for longer, which can reduce your risk of alcohol-induced food binges later in the night ( 4 ).
Since alcohol lowers inhibitions and has been shown to enhance appetite, choosing a filling meal before a night of drinking may be a smart way to minimize cravings later on ( 5 ).
You can enjoy  eggs  in many ways. Prepare them scrambled, hard-boiled, or mixed with your choice of veggies for a nutritious, fiber-filled omelet.

2. Oats
Oats double as a  great source of fiber  and protein, both of which support feelings of fullness and ease the effects of alcohol ( 6 ,  7 ).
In fact, a 1/2-cup (40-g) serving of uncooked oats supplies nearly 5 g of protein and 4 g of fiber, plus decent amounts of magnesium, selenium, and iron ( 7 ).
In addition to its stellar nutritional value, one older study found that  oats  could benefit liver health by improving liver function. In animal studies, it has also been shown to protect against alcohol-induced liver damage ( 8 ,  9 ,  10 ).
Besides oatmeal, oats work well in baked goods,  granola bars , and smoothies. They can even be blended and used as a base for pizza crusts, veggie patties, or flatbreads, which are perfect choices for pre-drinking snacks.

3. Bananas
Packing in 4 g of fiber per large fruit,  bananas  are an excellent, portable snack to have on hand before drinking to help slow alcohol absorption into your bloodstream ( 11 ).
Plus, they’re high in potassium, which may prevent  electrolyte imbalances  associated with drinking alcohol ( 11 ,  12 ).
Because they’re made up of nearly 75% water, bananas can also help keep you hydrated ( 11 ).
Bananas are a healthy, convenient snack all on their own but can also be topped with peanut butter or added to smoothies, fruit salads, oatmeal, or yogurt for a power-packed treat.

4. Salmon
Salmon is one of the best sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential fatty acids associated with a multitude of  health benefits  ( 12 ,  13 ).
Some animal research suggests that omega-3 fatty acids could help reduce some of the harmful effects of alcohol, including inflammation in the brain caused by binge drinking ( 14 ).
Salmon  is also high in protein, supplying a whopping 22 g in each 3-ounce (oz), or 85-g, cooked serving, which may help slow the absorption of alcohol ( 15 ).
One of the simplest ways to prepare salmon is by roasting it. Place salmon in a baking dish with the skin down and season with salt, pepper, and your choice of spices.
Simply bake at 400°F (200°C) for around 10–15 minutes, then pair with your choice of vegetables and enjoy as a healthy meal.

5. Greek yogurt
Offering a good balance of protein, fat, and carbs, unsweetened Greek  yogurt  is one of the best foods you can eat before a night of drinking ( 16 ).
Protein is especially key, as it’s digested slowly and can minimize the effects of alcohol on your body by slowing its absorption ( 2 ).
It can also help keep you full all night long to prevent hunger and  cravings  fueled by alcohol ( 17 ,  18 ).
Try topping unsweetened  Greek yogurt  with fruit, nuts, and seeds for an easy, filling, and delicious snack before drinking.

6. Chia pudding
Chia seeds are a great source of fiber and protein, as well as important micronutrients like  manganese , magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium ( 19 ).
In particular, fiber can help delay the emptying of your stomach and slow the absorption of alcohol into your bloodstream ( 3 ,  20 ).
Plus,  chia seeds  are rich in antioxidants, such as rosmarinic acid, gallic acid, and caffeic acid, all of which may help prevent cell damage and protect your liver, according to some animal studies ( 21 ,  22 ,  23 ,  24 ).
Chia pudding is easy to make. Simply mix 3 tablespoons (42 g) of chia seeds with 1 cup, or 237 milliliters, of dairy or  nondairy milk , alongside your choice of fruits, nuts, spices, and natural sweeteners.

7. Berries
Berries like strawberries, blackberries, and  blueberries  are loaded with essential nutrients, including fiber, manganese, and vitamins C and K ( 25 ).
They’re also rich in water, helping you stay hydrated, which minimizes the effects of alcohol and prevents dehydration ( 26 ).
What’s more, eating  antioxidant-rich foods  like berries may protect your cells against alcohol-induced damage.
One 2010 animal study found that blueberries were effective at increasing levels of several antioxidants in the liver, which could help protect against oxidative stress caused by alcohol consumption ( 27 ).
Another older study in 12 people noted that consuming 17.5 oz (500 g) of  strawberries  daily improved antioxidant status within 16 days ( 28 ).
Pair  berries  with a handful of almonds for a more substantial, pre-drinking snack, or try adding them to smoothies, fruit salads, and yogurt parfaits.

8. Asparagus
In addition to supplying an assortment of important vitamins and minerals,  asparagus  has also been well-studied for its ability to promote liver health.
In fact, one 2009 study found that asparagus extract increased the activity of two enzymes that metabolize alcohol and protected liver cells against damage ( 29 ).
What’s more, older test-tube studies indicate that asparagus is a great source of antioxidants like  ferulic acid , kaempferol, quercetin, rutin, and isorhamnetin, which prevent cell damage caused by excess alcohol consumption ( 30 ,  31 ).
For an easy side dish, drizzle asparagus with  olive oil , season with salt and pepper, and bake at 425°F (220°C) for 10–15 minutes, or until lightly browned.

9. Grapefruit
Grapefruit  is a flavorful citrus fruit that delivers a hearty dose of fiber, vitamin C, and vitamin A in each serving ( 32 ).
It also contains naringenin and naringin, two antioxidant compounds that have been shown to prevent liver damage and help optimize liver health in some older test-tube studies ( 33 ).
Plus, one animal study found that naringin could decrease alcohol-induced fat build-up and injury to the liver ( 34 ).
Try cutting grapefruit into wedges and sprinkling the fruit with a bit of salt or sugar to help balance the tangy, tart flavor.
However, keep in mind that grapefruit may interact with  certain medications , so be sure to speak with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns ( 35 ).

10. Melon
Melons are very rich in water and can help keep you hydrated while drinking.
For example,  watermelon  is made up of approximately 91% water, while cantaloupe is comprised of about 90% ( 36 ,  37 ).
These fruits are also rich in important electrolytes, such as potassium, which can quickly become depleted with excess alcohol consumption, according to some older research ( 37 ,  38 ,  39 ).
Honeydew , watermelon, and cantaloupe all make refreshing, hydrating snacks that can be cut into wedges or cubes.

11. Avocado
Rich in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats,  avocados  are one of the best foods you can eat before drinking alcohol.
That’s because fat takes much longer to digest than protein or carbs, which can help slow the absorption of alcohol into your bloodstream ( 3 ,  40 ).
Plus, avocados are  high in potassium  to help balance electrolytes, with just half an avocado providing 8% of the daily value ( 41 ).
Best of all, this fruit is as versatile as it is delicious. Try spreading it over toast, using it to top salads, or sprinkling wedges with a bit of salt for a tasty snack.

12. Quinoa
Quinoa is a  whole grain  high in protein, fiber, and a number of essential micronutrients ( 42 ).
It’s particularly high in magnesium and potassium, two minerals that can help minimize electrolyte imbalances caused by drinking alcohol ( 42 ).
It’s also a great source of antioxidants like  quercetin , ferulic acid, catechin, and kaempferol, which can protect against the buildup of harmful molecules known as free radicals caused by excessive alcohol consumption ( 43 ,  44 ).
Quinoa  can easily be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, or salads. You can also add it to homemade granola bars, energy bites, or muffins for a delicious and healthy pre-drinking snack.

13. Beets
Beets  stand out as a superstar ingredient, due both to their vibrant color and impressive antioxidant content ( 45 ).
One older animal study showed that beetroot juice exhibited a protective effect on liver cells and decreased cell damage ( 46 ).
Additional research found that  beetroot juice  decreased markers of liver-induced liver damage in rats ( 47 ).
Beets can be boiled, pickled, broiled, or roasted and used to make dips, soups, salsas, or slaws.

14. Sweet potatoes
Sweet potatoes  are not only a great source of potassium to help balance electrolyte levels when drinking alcohol but also high in complex carbs ( 48 ).
Complex carbs are composed of larger molecules that take longer to break down, which can be beneficial for reducing the effects of alcohol on your body ( 49 ).
According to a 2011 study in 10 people, eating boiled sweet potatoes minimized spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels, which could potentially reduce hunger and prevent overeating caused by drinking ( 18 ,  50 ).
Try whipping up a batch of  sweet potato fries  for an easy snack or side dish before going out. Simply cut sweet potatoes into wedges, toss with olive oil and spices, and bake 20–25 minutes at 425°F (220°C).

15. Trail mix
Homemade trail mix is a great option for a healthy, hearty snack before you start drinking.
Nuts  and seeds like almonds, walnuts, and pumpkin and flax seeds are all high in fiber and protein, which may help slow the emptying of your stomach to lessen the effects of alcohol ( 51 ).
Plus, they’re great sources of magnesium, potassium, and calcium, all of which can help prevent electrolyte disturbances caused by drinking ( 52 ).
Trail mix is easy to make using ingredients like nuts and  seeds  along with mix-ins, such as rolled oats, coconut flakes, and dried fruit.
If you want to opt for store-bought trail mixes, look for varieties without added sugars, salt, or artificial ingredients.

Foods to avoid before drinking alcohol
Being mindful of what foods to avoid before drinking alcohol is just as important as selecting nutritious foods to eat before a night out.
In some cases, alcohol can trigger symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition characterized by heartburn, nausea, and belching ( 53 ).
If you have  GERD  or are prone to indigestion, you may want to also avoid other triggers prior to drinking, such as spicy foods, chocolate, carbonated beverages, and caffeine ( 53 ).
What’s more, salty foods like potato chips, pretzels, and crackers may worsen bloating and fluid buildup caused by alcohol ( 54 ,  55 ).
Finally, be sure to skip the  refined carbs  and sugary foods and drinks, such as white bread, pasta, sweets, and sodas.
These foods and beverages are not only digested more rapidly but can also cause blood sugar levels to fluctuate, increasing your risk of overeating later in the night ( 56 ).
Additionally, be sure to stay hydrated by sipping on plain water throughout the night to reduce the chances of  hangover symptoms  in the morning ( 57 ).
Before drinking alcohol, you may want to avoid salty foods, refined carbs, and foods that trigger GERD.

The bottom line
Picking the right foods prior to  drinking alcohol  is incredibly important.
Certain foods can trigger indigestion, bloating, and heartburn while also upping your risk of increased cravings and hunger.
Meanwhile, other foods may not only ease some of the negative effects of alcohol but can also affect how you feel the next morning while protecting your long-term health.
