What’s so special about Hoka shoes?
Hoka shoes are made with advanced technologies that are unique to the brand. Here’s a brief description of their core features:
Cushioned midsole:  The midsole is the layer between the outsole and the insole that runs along the bottom of the shoe. Hoka shoes have a cushioned midsole that offers shock absorbency and added comfort to help  protect your joints .
Meta-Rocker:  The Meta-Rocker technology uses a low heel-to-toe drop — meaning the height difference between the heel and the ball of the feet is minimal — plus a rounded sole to help propel you forward.
Active Foot Frame:  The Active Foot Frame sits at the back of the shoe and helps cradle the heel and embed the foot into the midsole.
PROFLY:  PROFLY is another type of midsole offered by Hoka. It features soft foam in the heel and a firm foam in the toe, allowing for a cushioned landing and powerful toe-off.
J-Frame:  J-Frame technology offers added stability on the inner, medial side of the shoe to help prevent your foot from rolling inward.
Carbon fiber plate:  The carbon fiber plate is attached to Hoka’s Profly insole for smooth, comfortable, and lightweight propulsion.
HUBBLE heel:  The HUBBLE heel juts off the back of certain Hoka models. It helps reduce impact and creates a smooth heel-to-toe transition.

How to choose the best Hoka running shoe
Looking to buy a pair of Hoka running shoes? There are several factors to consider, including:
Intended use:  The type of running you plan on doing is the most important consideration when  shopping for shoes . For example, some are designed with extra stability for trail running, while others feature added cushioning to keep you comfortable on pavement.
Cushioning:  While all Hoka shoes are designed to be soft and comfortable, some offer more padding than others.
Stability:  Hoka shoes are specifically engineered to prevent ankle rolls. However, if you overpronate, you may want a pair that offers extra stability.
Customer reviews:  As running shoes are not cheap, it’s important to read customer reviews to ensure that you’re getting the best value for your money.
How it feels:  Keep in mind that the best way to evaluate a shoe is by trying it on in person.

Frequently asked questions about Hokas
HOKA shoes are often recommended (and even worn) by podiatrists, especially for people with foot concerns.
Dr. Sarah Haller , DPM, FACFAS suggests HOKAs “especially for patients suffering from pain in the front of their foot since they have a rocker bottom sole. This allows for less pressure to go through the front of the foot which helps with pain. Additionally, they have a large sole which helps with impact for people with heel pain. This is particularly important for people who spend the majority of their day on their feet.”
“These shoes tend to last 6 to 8 months depending on how much you’re walking on a daily basis and if you participate in outside sports. You want to be cognizant of when you buy them. I encourage my patients to label the inner aspect of the shoe, under the tongue, including the month and year when purchased,” Haller says.
It’s also a good idea to periodically check the shoe’s tread, which is a good indication of when it needs to be replaced.
Hokas do offer arch support, but the level of support depends on which model you choose. Hoka currently has three stability options: neutral, moderate, and stable.
“A neutral shoe will have the least amount of arch reinforcement, while stable will have the most,” says  Dr. Alissa Kuizinas , a board certified podiatrist specializing in holistic and functional foot health.

The bottom line
Hoka offers comfortable, reliable running shoes with options available in a variety of fits and styles.
By considering the type of running you do and using the list above, we’re confident that you’ll find the perfect Hoka running shoe for you.
