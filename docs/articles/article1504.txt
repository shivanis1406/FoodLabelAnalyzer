Title: 35 Fun Ways to Eat Chia Seeds

You can add chia seeds to baked goods, drinks like smoothies, and other recipes to add extra nutrition to your diet.

Chia seeds are tiny but mighty — and extremely nutritious.
Just 1 ounce (28.35 grams)  contains  10 grams of fiber, 5 grams of protein, and 138 calories.
They’re a great source of omega-3 fatty acids and some minerals essential for bone health, including calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium.
Chia seeds are also extremely mild in flavor, making them easy to add to many foods and recipes.
Here are 35 ways to eat chia seeds.

1. Chia water
One of the simplest ways to add  chia seeds  to your diet is to add them to water.
To make  chia water , soak 1/4 cup (40 grams) of chia seeds in 4 cups (1 liter) of water for 20–30 minutes.
To give your drink some flavor, you can add chopped fruit or squeeze in a lemon, lime, or orange.

2. Juice-soaked chia
Water isn’t the only liquid you can soak these seeds in.
Add 1/4 cup (40 grams) of chia seeds to 4 cups (1 liter) of fruit juice and soak for 30 minutes to make a drink that’s full of  fiber  and minerals.
This recipe gives you several servings of juice. Just make sure to choose 100% fruit juice and limit your intake to  4–10 ounces per day , as fruit juice contains lots of sugar.

3. Chia pudding
You can make chia pudding as you would chia water. For a thicker, pudding-like texture, add more seeds and let the mixture soak longer.
You can make this treat with juice or milk, including flavorings like vanilla and  cocoa .
Chia pudding makes a delicious dish that can be eaten for breakfast or as dessert. If you don’t like the seeds’ texture, try blending the pudding to give it a smoother finish.

4. Chia in smoothies
If you want to make your  smoothie  even more nutritious, consider adding chia seeds.
You can use chia in almost any smoothie by soaking the seeds before adding them. This makes a gel.

5. Raw chia toppings
Although many people prefer to soak chia seeds, you can eat them raw, too.
Try grinding and sprinkling them on your smoothie or  oatmeal .

6. Chia cereal
To try something a little different for breakfast, you could swap your usual cereal for chia cereal.
To make it, soak the seeds overnight in milk (or a  milk substitute  like almond milk) and top with nuts, fruit, or spices like cinnamon. You can also use mashed banana and vanilla extract to make a delicious morning treat.

7. Chia truffles
If you’re often in a hurry, you can use chia seeds to make a great on-the-go snack.
For a quick and easy no-bake snack, try chia truffles that combine  dates , cocoa, and oats.

8. In a stir-fry
You can even add chia seeds to savory dishes like  stir-fries . Just add a tablespoon (15 grams) of seeds and mix.

9. Added to a salad
Chia seeds can be sprinkled on  your salad  to give it some texture and a healthy boost. Simply mix them in and add your favorite salad vegetables.

10. In salad dressing
You can also add chia seeds to your salad dressing.
Commercially prepared salad dressings are often  loaded with sugar . Making your own dressing can be a much more nutrient-dense alternative.

11. Baked in bread
You can add chia seeds to many recipes, including bread. For example, you can try homemade buckwheat bread that’s healthful and flavorful.

12. As a crispy crumb coating for meat or fish
Another fun way to use chia seeds is as a coating for meat or  fish .
Ground into a fine powder, the seeds can be mixed with your usual breadcrumb coating or used to substitute it altogether, depending on your preference.

13. Baked in cakes
Cakes are usually high in fat and sugar. However, chia seeds can help improve their nutritional profiles.
Adding them to your cake mix will boost the fiber, protein, and  omega-3  content.

14. Mixed with other grains
If you don’t like the gooey texture of soaked chia seeds, you can mix them with other  grains .
You don’t need a fancy recipe. Simply stir 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of chia seeds into a cup (180 grams) of rice or quinoa.

15. In breakfast bars
Breakfast bars  can be very high in sugar. In fact, some contain as much sugar as a candy bar.

18. Baked in cookies
If you love cookies, chia seeds can give your cookie recipe a nutritional boost.
Both oatmeal and chocolate chip cookies are good options.

19. Chia protein bars
Like breakfast bars, many commercially prepared  protein bars  can be high in refined sugar and taste more like a candy bar than a  healthy snack .
Homemade chia-based protein bars are a nutritious alternative to prepackaged ones.

Adding chia seeds to your crackers is a good way to include them in your diet.
