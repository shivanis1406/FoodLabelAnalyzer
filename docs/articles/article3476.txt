Title: The 20 Best Prebiotic Foods You Should Eat

Prebiotics are types of fiber that feed your friendly gut bacteria. Here are 19 healthy foods rich in prebiotics.
Prebiotics allow your gut bacteria to  produce nutrients  for your colon cells, which leads to a healthier digestive system.
Some of these nutrients include  short-chain fatty acids  like butyrate, acetate, and propionate, which can be absorbed into your bloodstream and improve metabolic health.
However, prebiotics shouldn’t be confused with  probiotics , which are live bacteria found in certain foods or supplements.
Read on to explore 19 healthy prebiotic foods to add to your grocery list.

1. Chicory root
Chicory root  is a great source of prebiotics.
Approximately  68%  of chicory root fiber comes from the prebiotic fiber inulin, which is a compound that  helps improve  digestion and bowel function and helps relieve constipation.

2. Dandelion greens
The greens of  dandelion  flowers can be cooked or consumed raw.
They  contain fiber , a high portion of which also  comes from inulin.

3. Jerusalem artichoke
The Jerusalem artichoke — also known as the sunroot, sunchoke, or earth apple — is part of the sunflower family. It, too, contains  inulin-rich dietary fiber .
Along with its other benefits, inulin  helps increase  the friendly bacteria in your colon, promoting greater digestive health. It can also aid in the absorption of minerals in your large intestine.

4. Garlic
Garlic  is a flavorful herb linked to  various health benefits .
Garlic acts as a prebiotic by  promoting the growth  of beneficial  Bifidobacteria  in the gut. It also helps prevent disease-promoting bacteria from growing.

5. Onions
Onions  have many  health benefits . They are also  rich in inulin , as well as fructooligosaccharides ( FOS) .
FOS is a type of carbohydrate that  helps strengthen  gut flora and helps with fat breakdown.

6. Leeks
Leeks  come from the same family as onions and garlic, and they offer similar  health benefits.
Leeks are nutrient-dense, which means they’re low in calories but high in vitamins and minerals. Thanks to their inulin content, leeks promote healthy gut bacteria and help break down fat.

7. Asparagus
Asparagus  is a popular vegetable and another great source of prebiotics. Like other foods on this list, this nutritious vegetable  naturally contains  inulin.

8. Bananas
Bananas  also  contain  some inulin. Unripe (green) bananas are also high in  resistant starch , which has  prebiotic effects .
In addition, bananas contain a variety of other compounds  beneficial to health .

9. Barley
Barley  contains  beta-glucan , which is a  prebiotic fiber .
Beta-glucan in barley  has been shown  to lower total and LDL (bad) cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. It may also help  lower blood sugar levels .

10. Oats
Whole oats  are a healthy grain with prebiotic benefits. Like barley, they contain  beta-glucan fiber,  as well as  resistant starch . Oats  also contain  various phytochemicals that  act as prebiotics .
Research  also suggests that in addition to their prebiotic properties and their positive impact on healthy gut bacteria, they have  other health benefits , such as helping lower cholesterol.

11. Apples
Apples  contain  pectin , a type of soluble fiber with  prebiotic benefits.
Pectin  increases  butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that feeds beneficial gut bacteria and decreases the population of harmful bacteria. However, more research is needed to fully explore the benefits of pectin in humans.

12. Konjac root
Konjac  root, also known as elephant yam, is a tuber — or a vegetable grown underground, like the potato.
Flour made from this tuber contains  70% to 90%  of a highly viscous dietary fiber called  glucomannan fiber , which  can act  as a prebiotic by promoting the growth of good gut bacteria. It also has many other  health benefits.

13. Cocoa
Cocoa beans  are seeds from the  Theobrama cacao  tree used to make chocolate.  Cocoa powder  makes it easy to add cocoa to oatmeal, smoothies, yogurt, and other recipes.
Cocoa is a  rich source  of polyphenols, such as flavanols, which exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects .  These compounds also help grow beneficial gut bacteria while reducing the growth of harmful bacteria.

14. Burdock root
Burdock root  is a vegetable commonly used in Japan and has proven health benefits.
Burdock root is  rich  in inulin and FOS, which support the growth of healthy bacteria in the digestive tract. It also  also contains  phenolic compounds.

15. Flaxseeds
Flaxseeds  are a great source of prebiotics.
The fiber in flaxseeds promotes healthy gut bacteria and  encourages  regular bowel movements. They also  contain  phenolic antioxidants.

16. Yacon root
Yacon root  is a vegetable very similar to sweet potatoes that is rich in fiber.
It is  particularly rich  in prebiotic FOS and inulin. It also contains phenolic compounds that give it antioxidant properties.

17. Jicama root
Jicama root  is low in  calories  and high in fiber, including the prebiotic fiber inulin.
In older  animal research , jicama root was shown to  help  improve digestive health, enhance  insulin sensitivity , and lower blood sugar levels.

18. Wheat bran
Wheat bran  is the outer layer of the whole wheat grain. It contains a special type of fiber made of arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXOS).
In  animal research , AXOS fiber from wheat bran  has been shown  to boost healthy  Bifidobacteria  in the gut.
In humans, wheat bran  has also been shown  to help increase the presence of Bifidobacterium in fecal matter, which leads to softer stools in healthy individuals whose digestion was slow.

19. Seaweed
Seaweed  is a form of marine algae  rich in prebiotics , as well as  other healthy compounds .
Lab studies  have shown that polysaccharides found in seaweed can increase the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which nourish the cells lining your gut.
However, more human research is needed to explore the full benefits of seaweed.

20. Avocado
Like apples, avocados  contain pectin , which has prebiotic properties.
Research  suggests that eating avocadoes regularly can help decrease the levels of bile acids in the feces, increase levels of healthy fatty acids and short-chain fatty acids, and lead to a higher presence of good gut bacteria.

The bottom line
Prebiotic foods are high in special types of fiber that support digestive health.
They promote the increase of  friendly bacteria  in the gut, help with various digestive problems, and even boost your immune system.
Prebiotic foods have also been shown to improve metabolic health and even help prevent certain diseases.
Since the fiber content of these foods may be altered during cooking, try to consume them raw rather than cooked to gain the full health benefits.
With a variety of options available, you can take your time to find the best prebiotic foods for yourself and your gut.
