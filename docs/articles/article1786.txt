Title: Freshly Review: A Dietitian’s Expert Take

As of January 2023, Freshly has announced that it is closing down its meal delivery operation. If you’re interested in a similarly prepared meal delivery service, we recommend trying  Factor  or  Trifecta Nutrition  instead.

What is Freshly?
Freshly is a meal delivery service that offers fully prepared dishes that can be heated and ready in just 3 minutes.
Meals are portioned into single servings and made without artificial flavors, excess sugars, or chemical preservatives.
Menus are also customizable, allowing you to mix and match your favorite meals based on your personal preferences.

How Freshly works
Freshly offers plans that include 4–12 meals per week, with more than 35 dishes to choose from.
The menu rotates regularly, and customers place orders 1 week at a time via the company’s website or mobile app.
All meals are fully prepared, portioned, and ready to enjoy in just 3 minutes. The entire menu is free of refined sugars and artificial flavors, and many of the meals are made in a  gluten-free  facility.
Freshly is available in most of the continental United States. You can check availability for your area by entering your ZIP code on the company’s website.
Shipping typically takes 1–2 days, and you can often schedule deliveries for a certain day of the week. Shipment tracking is also available via Freshly’s website and app.

Meal selection
Each week, you can create your own custom menu by choosing 4–12 meals from a selection of more than 35 recipes in numerous categories. All meals are portioned into single servings and can be heated in the microwave.
Meals rotate each week, and new dishes are added regularly to bring some diversity to your diet.
The service also offers several bulk portions of proteins and side dishes that you can use to help streamline meal prep, such as grilled chicken breasts, sauteed green beans, and mashed potatoes.
Low carb, high protein, plant-based, and gluten-free items are also labeled on the weekly menu and can be selected for as many meals as you’d like.
The meals are preportioned, and many contain fewer than 500 calories. As such, the service may be helpful for those looking to lose weight.
Plus, the nutrition label and ingredient list are available for each meal, which may make Freshly a good option for people who are tracking their nutrient intake or have  allergies  or specific dietary restrictions.
That said, you can filter meals only by menu, not by ingredient or dietary preference.
Also keep in mind that options for people on vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, ketogenic, or paleo diets are limited. For example, when Healthline tried Freshly, there were only four plant-based recipes to choose from that week.
The meals are premade and arrive at your door in a cooler box.
Here are three examples of Freshly’s offerings:
Steak Peppercorn.  This meal includes a grilled flat iron steak, mashed potatoes, a side of French green beans, and sauteed carrots tossed with garlic oil, lemon, and herbs. It’s served with a creamy peppercorn sauce made with yogurt and porcini mushrooms.
Three-Bean Ancho Turkey Chili Bowl.  This meal includes ground turkey;  pinto , kidney, and black beans; red bell peppers; onions; and tomatoes, all seasoned with cayenne and ancho chile and topped with cheddar cheese.
Thai-ish Lemongrass Bowl.  This meal includes Thai-inspired lemongrass sauce with coconut milk, ginger, and garlic, as well as pieces of seared chicken thighs, broccoli florets, bell peppers, onions, and  basmati rice .

Freshly ingredients
Freshly claims that its meals are made using high quality foods that are free of artificial ingredients and  refined sugar .
In fact, the company only uses  meat  that has been inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and is free of fillers, additives, and preservatives.
Most produce is also sourced from vendors based in the United States, depending on seasonality and availability.
However, Freshly does not place as much emphasis on organic or sustainably sourced ingredients as other companies.
Nutritionally, there’s no significant difference between organic and high quality conventionally grown produce, but some people may prefer organic and sustainable ingredients.

Packaging and materials
All Freshly meals are delivered in a recyclable cardboard box. Each package contains reusable gel packs and denim insulation, which is 85% biodegradable.
Meals are packaged in plastic containers that are microwave-safe and don’t release  bisphenol A , a chemical that can have negative health effects ( 1 ).
The plastic, container, and cardboard sleeve are all recyclable as well.
The nutrition facts and ingredients are  listed directly on the container  for each meal to prevent unnecessary packaging, paper, and plastic.

How much does Freshly cost?
The pricing for Freshly can vary, depending on how many meals you select each week.
Here is how much each plan costs:
4–5 meals per week:  $11.79/meal
6–7 meals per week : $9.99/meal
8–9 meals per week:  $9.49/meal
10–11 meals per week:  $9.29/meal
12 meals per week:  $8.99/meal
Although ordering more meals per week can decrease the total price per serving, Freshly is fairly costly compared with some competitors.
For example, if you order the minimum of 4 meals per week, you’ll pay $47.16, while ordering the maximum of 12 meals per week brings your total to $107.88.
Keep in mind that some meals use premium ingredients and may cost an additional $1.49–$2.49 per serving.
Additionally, if you order bulk portions of proteins and sides in place of your regular meals, there may be an additional cost for some items, ranging from $0.99–$4.99.
Applicable shipping fees are calculated when you place your order and can cost $9.99–$11.99, depending on how many meals you order.

Customer service
Freshly offers several support services in case you have issues with your order.
You can call or text a customer service representative 24/7 or chat or email with them via Freshly’s website.
A list of frequently asked questions is also available at Freshly’s online support center.
If you need to skip a week, cancel your subscription, or modify your weekly meal plan, you can also easily do so on the company’s website.

Customer reviews and brand reputation
Though Freshly is not accredited by the  Better Business Bureau (BBB) , they currently hold a rating of 4.54 out of 5 stars, which is based on 347 customer reviews.
They also have a C+ rating from the BBB, which is based on factors like their complaint history, their business practices, and whether there are any known advertising issues or government actions against the company.
On  TrustPilot , Freshly has an average rating of 4.9 out of 5 stars at the time of publication, which is based on 12,733 customer reviews.
Positive reviews note that the meals are tasty and convenient. Many also say the customer service team is fast and efficient at resolving any issues with orders.
On the other hand, less favorable reviews report dissatisfaction with the nutritional value of dishes as well as the limited meal selection for certain diet patterns.
Some customers also report experiencing issues with late or missing deliveries, incorrect items, and inadequate portion sizes.

My experience trying Freshly
Editor here! To further help you decide whether Freshly is the right meal delivery service for you, I tried a week of meals to provide insights into the taste, texture, and quality of the meals.
Selecting my meals was easy, as you can pick and choose items from any of Freshly’s menus.
I prefer to eat mostly plant-based, so I was a bit disheartened to see only four suitable options. However, my meat-eating partner was perfectly happy sampling the other meals we received.
Here are the meals we chose:
Farmstead Baked Lentil Pasta
Buffalo Cauliflower Mac and Cheese
Unwrapped Salsa Verde Burrito
Beef & Broccoli Bowl
White Bean Turkey Chili Bowl
Sesame-Ginger Chicken and Noodles
Freshly meals are created by a team of chefs and  nutritionists , offering a good balance of flavor and nutrients.
Meals are delivered fully cooked, free of preservatives and artificial ingredients, and as fresh as possible.
My meals arrived in an insulated box with multiple layers of ice packs to keep them cold. Once unpacked, the meals were easy to stack in my fridge for the week.
All the meals I tried were indeed bursting with flavor. Texturewise, while the vegetables and grains weren’t as soft or mushy as many frozen entrees I’ve had in the past, they were still softer than they would have been if I had prepared the meals myself using fresh ingredients.
Personally, I didn’t mind the softer textures, but if you prefer chewy grains or crisp vegetables, then Freshly may not be for you.
Another thing to note is that most of the meals I received were around 400 calories. While I found them filling, my partner needed an  additional snack  to fully satisfy his hunger.
Compared with those of many other meal delivery services, Freshly meals require very little time and effort.
In fact, meals come fully prepared and can be  heated  and served in less than 3 minutes.
This drastically reduces the time spent in the kitchen and makes Freshly a great option for busy people seeking delicious, healthy meals that are ready in a pinch.
No, but it isn’t because I didn’t enjoy the meals.
In fact, I’d much prefer Freshly over most store-bought frozen entrees.
However, as there are three of us at home, Freshly isn’t a great solution for dinners, because each meal is only one serving. Additionally, I have several lunch recipes that are easy to  meal prep  and more budget-friendly than a Freshly subscription.
However, if Freshly ever offered a one-time order option, I’d happily take advantage of it, as it’s always helpful to have a few ready-to-go meals on hand.

Comparison with competitors
Compared with similar meal delivery services, Freshly is relatively expensive, with meals starting at $8.99 per serving.
Other companies, such as  Nutrisystem , start at around $9.99 for a whole day of meals, including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.
Freshly also differs from services such as  HelloFresh and Blue Apron  in that all Freshly meals are fully prepared and can be cooked and served in just 3 minutes.
However, Freshly’s meal options are somewhat limited compared with those of other plans. This can make it challenging if you’re following a specific diet or have any dietary restrictions.
Because the meals are prepared for you, Freshly is not the best option if you’re a picky eater or dislike commonly used ingredients such as onions or garlic.
Additionally, Freshly focuses only on lunch and dinner. It doesn’t offer any add-ons like breakfasts or snacks.
Finally, while many meal services offer plans with larger serving sizes to accommodate families, Freshly allows you to select only up to 12 single-serve meals per week.

Who should try Freshly?
The convenience and ease of Freshly may make it a good fit for busy individuals who have limited time to spend on food preparation.
It can also be a great way to start introducing more healthy, nutrient-rich foods into your diet, as all meals are free of artificial flavors, refined sugars, and preservatives.
Because  meals are delivered fully prepared , it isn’t a great choice for those hoping to learn how to cook or prepare healthy meals at home.
It also doesn’t emphasize  organic  or sustainably sourced ingredients, which is an important consideration for some.
Still, Freshly can be a good alternative to fast food or frozen meals for those looking to eat healthy with minimal effort.
