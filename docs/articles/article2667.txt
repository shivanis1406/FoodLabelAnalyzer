Title: 14 Symptoms of Iron Deficiency Anemia

Iron deficiency occurs when your body doesn’t have enough iron and can lead to a condition called iron deficiency anemia. Common symptoms include fatigue, pallor, and breathlessness.
Your body needs iron to make hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen through your blood vessels. If your body doesn’t have enough hemoglobin, your tissues and muscles won’t get enough oxygen to be able to work effectively.
Here are 14 signs and symptoms of iron deficiency, starting with the most common. Also, find out how to recognize anemia in children and older adults, and when to see a doctor.

1. Unusual tiredness
Feeling tired  is a common symptom of  iron deficiency anemia .
Fatigue happens because your body lacks the iron it needs to make  hemoglobin , which helps carry oxygen around your body.
Without enough hemoglobin, less oxygen reaches your tissues and muscles, depriving them of energy. Your heart also has to work harder to move more oxygen-rich blood around your body, which can make you tired.
Since  tiredness  is often part of a busy, modern life, it’s difficult to diagnose an iron deficiency based on this symptom alone.
However, tiredness that occurs with pallor, shortness of breath, and other symptoms may be a sign of anemia.
Learn about other causes of chronic fatigue.

2. Skin that’s paler than usual
Skin that’s  paler  than usual, as well as pale coloring of the inside of the lower eyelids,  can also indicate  iron deficiency.
The hemoglobin in red blood cells gives blood its red color, so low levels caused by iron deficiency make the blood less red. That’s why skin can lose some of its color or warmth in people with iron deficiency.
A  2023 review of research  notes that pallor in the creases of the palms or inside the eyelids is a reliable indicator of anemia. If you pull your lower eyelid down while looking in a mirror, the inside layer should be a vibrant red color. If it’s a very pale pink or yellow, you may have iron deficiency.
In people with darker skin tones, the eyelid may be the only area where this condition is noticeable.
However, other health conditions can cause pallor or  skin that appears blue or gray . Only a blood test can confirm a diagnosis of anemia.

3. Shortness of breath
When hemoglobin levels are low with iron deficiency, oxygen levels are also typically low. This means that your muscles  won’t receive  enough oxygen to do everyday activities, such as  walking .
As a result, your breathing rate will increase as your body tries to get more oxygen, resulting in  shortness of breath .
If you find yourself out of breath when doing daily tasks that you used to find easy, such as walking, climbing stairs, or working out, it may be due to iron deficiency.
Shortness of breath can also result from  other health conditions , so it’s important to talk with a doctor and get tested for iron deficiency anemia.

4. Headaches
Researchers are still examining the link between  iron deficiency and headaches . A  2019 study  determined a correlation between migraine episodes and iron-deficiency anemia in females.
Several factors may possibly contribute, including altered dopamine function and estrogen levels. Iron deficiency  can occur  during heavy menstruation, and  headaches  can also occur due to iron deficiency and menstrual migraine.
A  2023 study  found a relationship between iron deficiency anemia and chronic daily headache, a headache condition, with severe iron deficiency worsening symptoms.
Although there are many causes of headaches, frequent, recurrent headaches may happen due to an iron deficiency.

5. Heart palpitations
You may have noticeable heartbeats, or  heart palpitations , if you have iron deficiency anemia.
Low blood oxygen levels from iron deficiency anemia  may lead to  heart palpitations, tachycardia (a fast heart rhythm), and chest pain.
Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that helps transport oxygen around your body. In iron deficiency, low hemoglobin levels mean the heart has to work extra hard to carry oxygen.
This may lead to irregular heartbeats or the feeling that your heart is beating abnormally fast.
Consequently, iron deficiency  may worsen  heart conditions, such as  heart failure  and coronary heart disease, and reduce the ability to exercise.
Note that heart palpitations can also have  other causes , including anxiety, caffeine use, and dehydration.

6. Dry and damaged hair and skin
Dry or damaged  skin  and hair  can occur  with iron deficiency anemia. Nutritional deficiencies can deprive hair and skin of the nutrients and blood flow they need to grow.
Iron deficiency is also associated with  hair loss , and some  research  suggests it may be a cause.
Hair often falls out during everyday washing and brushing. But, significant  hair loss  may be a symptom of iron deficiency.
Get some tips on preventing hair loss.

7. Swelling and soreness of your tongue or mouth
Sometimes, changes inside or outside of your mouth can indicate iron deficiency anemia. Symptoms  include :
a swollen, inflamed, pale, or smooth mucus membrane
burning tongue
dry mouth
a burning feeling in your mouth
sore, red cracks at the corners of your mouth
mouth ulcers
What else can cause tongue swelling and soreness?

8. Restless legs
Iron deficiency  can lead  to  restless leg syndrome , as it can cause a drop in dopamine in your blood.
This condition involves a strong urge to move your legs while they’re at rest. It may also cause unpleasant crawling or itching sensations in your feet and legs. It’s usually worse at night and can make it  difficult to sleep .
The causes of primary restless leg syndrome are not fully understood. However, it can stem from various medical conditions, including iron deficiency anemia.
What are the best treatments for restless leg syndrome?

9. Brittle or spoon-shaped fingernails
Spoon-shaped fingernails , also called koilonychia, are another symptom of iron deficiency anemia.
Usually, the first indicator is  brittle nails  that chip and crack easily.
In the later stages of iron deficiency, the nails can become spoon-shaped, meaning that the middle of your nail dips and the edges raise to give a rounded appearance like a spoon.
This is a  rare side effect  and is usually reversible with treatment to boost the body’s iron levels.

10 to 14. Other symptoms of iron deficiency anemia
You may also have other symptoms of iron deficiency. These tend to be less common and may be linked to many conditions other than iron deficiency.
Other signs of iron deficiency anemia include:
Cold hands and feet:  Iron deficiency means less oxygen delivery to your hands and feet. Some people may feel the cold more easily in general or  experience  cold hands and feet.
Strange cravings:  A craving for strange foods or non-food items is called  pica . A person may crave ice, clay, dirt, chalk, or paper. It can occur during pregnancy and  may indicate  iron deficiency.
Feelings of depression:  There may  be a link  between iron deficiency anemia and depression in adults,  including  during and after pregnancy.
More frequent infections:  Iron is needed for a healthy immune system, and a lack of iron  may increase  your risk of infections.
Low appetite:  Iron deficiency is  linked to  low appetite due to changes in the hunger hormone  ghrelin .

Symptoms of anemia in children
Children with iron deficiency anemia  may :
have pale skin
appear irritable or fussy
lack energy
tire quickly
have a rapid heart rate
have a sore or swollen tongue
have an enlarged spleen, just below the ribs
show signs of pica, such as wanting to eat ice

Symptoms of anemia in older adults
Anemia is common in older adults, but it can be hard to identify, as some of the symptoms are common as people get older.
Symptoms include:
fatigue
difficulty thinking and focusing
depression
muscle weakness
frailty
Compared with younger people, older adults are more likely to have conditions associated with iron deficiency anemia, such as chronic kidney disease, inflammation, and nutritional deficiencies.
Older adults are also  more likely  to use certain medications, like  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , anticoagulants, and proton pump inhibitors over a long period, which may cause blood loss in the stomach or reduce iron absorption.

When to see a doctor
Talk with a doctor if you have symptoms of iron deficiency.
Iron deficiency anemia can cause complications, such as:
heart problems
depression
a higher chance of infections
pregnancy issues
People who are  pregnant  or have heavy menstrual periods have a higher risk. Consider talking with a doctor about testing for iron deficiency anemia.
If a doctor confirms that you have iron deficiency, typically via a blood test, they can develop a treatment plan to improve your iron levels.
They may recommend:
increasing your intake of iron via your diet
taking  supplements
IV iron infusions
However, if the doctor suspects anemia stems from gastrointestinal problems, they may recommend further tests and procedures, including upper and lower  endoscopies .
If you think you have iron deficiency anemia, consult with a doctor before changing your diet or taking supplements.
