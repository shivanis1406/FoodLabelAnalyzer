Title: Is Peanut Butter Good or Bad for Your Health?

For those who aren’t allergic, peanut butter can be a good source of protein and healthy fat. But it’s high in calories, and some brands contain  unhealthy ingredients . Natural peanut butter may be a healthier choice.
Peanut butter is a popular spread known for its delicious taste and unique texture. That said, some people may be allergic to  peanuts , which can be life threatening.
If you’re not allergic, peanut butter is not unhealthy, but  many commercial brands may contain  added sugar  and  trans fats .
If you choose natural peanut butter made with only peanuts and salt, eating it may have several health benefits.
Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction to a trigger, such as an allergy, and is potentially life threatening.
Symptoms can develop quickly and include:
feeling faint or lightheaded
difficulty breathing or wheezing
rapid heartbeat
confusion
anxiety
clammy skin
collapsing or losing consciousness
hives
swelling
stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting
If you or someone nearby develops these symptoms, you should:
Check to see whether they have an epinephrine pen. If they do, read and follow the instructions to dispense the medication.
Dial 911 (or a local emergency number).
Lay them down. If they have vomited, lay them on their side.
Stay with them until emergency services arrive.
It is possible for someone to need more than one injection with an epinephrine pen. If symptoms do not begin to clear after  5 minutes , give a second injection if one is available.

Good protein source
Peanut butter is a fairly balanced energy source that supplies all of the three major macronutrients.
A  3.5-ounce (oz) or 100-gram (g) portion of peanut butter  contains 22.5 g of protein (14% of calories), which is quite a lot compared with most other plant foods.
That said, though peanut butter is fairly protein-rich, it’s low in the essential amino acid  methionine  because  legume protein  contains much less of it than animal protein.
Methionine deficiency is usually associated with an overall protein deficiency or certain disease states. However, it is extremely rare in people who are generally in good health.
On the other hand, low methionine intake  has also been thought  to have some health benefits. Studies have shown that it may extend the life span of rats and mice, but it’s unclear if it works the same way in humans.

Low in carbs
Peanut butter is relatively low in carbs , containing about 22 g of carbs (14% of calories) per 3.5 oz, 5 of which are fiber.
This makes it it suitable for a keto or  low carb diet . It also  causes  a very low rise in blood sugar, making it a good option for people with type 2 diabetes.
One  large review  of eight studies found that eating peanut butter regularly was linked to a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes long term.
These benefits may be partly attributed to oleic acid, one of the main fats in peanuts. Antioxidants  may also play  a role.

High in healthy fats
Peanut butter is very high in fat, containing about 51 g of fat per a 3.5 oz portion, which is about  597 calories .
That said, peanut butter’s fats are relatively heart-healthy.  These include a healthy type of  monounsaturated fat  called oleic acid a nd an essential omega-6 fatty acid called linoleic acid.
Oleic acid  has been linked  to several health benefits, such as improved insulin sensitivity. Some  studies  also suggest that a high intake of omega-6 fatty acids,  relative to omega-3 , may increase inflammation and the risk of chronic disease.
However,  higher-quality studies  show that linoleic acid does not raise the blood levels of inflammatory markers, casting doubt on this theory. So, more research is necessary.
Despite their high calorie content, eating moderate amounts of pure peanut butter or whole peanuts is  perfectly fine  on a weight-loss diet. Like anything else, consume it in moderation.

Rich in vitamins and minerals
Peanut butter is fairly nutritious. A  3.5 oz (100 g) portio n of peanut butter provides many vitamins and minerals ( 4 ):
Vitamin E:  60% of the daily value (DV)
Vitamin B3 (niacin):  84% of the DV
Vitamin B6:  29% of the DV
Folate:  18% of the DV
Magnesium:  37% of the DV
Copper:  56% of the DV
Manganese:  65% of the DV
It is also high in biotin and contains decent amounts of:
vitamin B5
iron
potassium
zinc
selenium
However, calorie for calorie, peanut butter isn’t that nutritious compared with low calorie plant foods like spinach or broccoli.

Rich in antioxidants
Like most real foods, peanut butter contains more than just the basic vitamins and minerals. It also contains plenty of other biologically active nutrients, which can have some health benefits.
Peanut butter is  quite rich  in antioxidants, such as p-coumaric acid. It also contains some resveratrol, which is  associated  with a lower risk of heart disease and other chronic diseases in animals.  Resveratrol  has many other potential benefits, although human evidence is still limited.

Natural vs processed peanut butter
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration defines natural or unprocessed peanut butter as having to contain at least 90% peanuts. Other than that, peanut butter can only include salt, sweeteners, and hydrogenated vegetable oils that don’t contain trans fat.
But, processed brands often contain other ingredients, such as  palm oil , which may be less beneficial to health. For this reason, it may be healthier to choose a natural peanut butter brand.
That said, eating unprocessed peanut butter isn’t without risks because it  may contain  aflatoxins, which are considered harmful to health. These substances enter into peanuts when they grow underground from colonization by the mold  Aspergillus .
Some human studies conducted in developing countries have linked aflatoxin exposure to health problems such as  liver cancer  or  stunted growth .
There are some concerns about the long-term health effects of aflatoxins, particularly in developing countries, but according to the National Cancer Institute,  no outbreaks  of illnesses associated with aflatoxins have been reported in the  United States.
Aflatoxins are  significantly removed  from processed brands, and the  United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) also closely monitors the amounts of aflatoxins in foods to ensure that they don’t exceed recommended limits.
So if you wish to avoid these toxins, you can stick to commercial brands of peanut butter. If you choose unprocessed peanut butter, toss out any that appears moldy, shriveled, or discolored.
As an alternative, you can also consider trying  almond butter , which is a bit more nutritious than peanut butter in terms of the vitamins, minerals, and fiber it contains.

The bottom line
There are a lot of good things about peanut butter, but also a few negatives.
It’s fairly rich in nutrients and a decent protein source. It’s also loaded with fiber, vitamins, and minerals, although this doesn’t seem as significant when you consider the high calorie load.
It is perfectly fine to incorporate moderate amounts of peanut butter into a healthy diet. But the main problem with peanut butter is that it’s so incredibly hard to resist.
Moderate peanut butter consumption is unlikely to have any major negative effects. If possible, it’s more important to steer clear of sugary soda, trans fats, and other highly processed foods.
