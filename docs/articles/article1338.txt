Title: Does Kombucha Make You Poop?

Kombucha is a potentially good source of probiotics, which can promote gut health and prevent constipation. It can also help keep you hydrated, which is important for improving stool consistency and promoting regularity.
Kombucha is a fizzy, fermented beverage that provides many potential health benefits.
It’s also one of my favorite drinks because it’s delicious, refreshing, and easy to make at home.
Plus, it’s packed with gut-healthy probiotics, which may lead you to wonder whether this beverage affects regularity and digestion.
While kombucha is unlikely to act as a laxative on its own, it may have several other digestive effects that support bowel regularity.
This article examines kombucha’s digestive effects to determine whether it helps  you poop .

Supports gut health
Like other fermented foods, kombucha is loaded with  probiotics , a type of beneficial bacteria found in your gut.
Probiotics are associated with a long list of impressive benefits, especially when it comes to digestive health. In fact, studies show that they may  reduce inflammation  in your gut, alleviate diarrhea, and enhance nutrient absorption ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
What’s more, one review found that probiotic supplements significantly reduced symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a condition whose symptoms include constipation, diarrhea, stomach pain, and bloating ( 4 ).
Keep in mind that these studies are focused on the effects of probiotic supplements rather than probiotic-rich foods like kombucha.
Additionally, because the probiotic content of kombucha varies widely, it’s unclear how much kombucha you would need to drink to achieve similar results.
Kombucha is a good source of probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria that support several aspects of gut health.

May prevent constipation
Although no research has directly examined kombucha and constipation, some studies have found that increasing your intake of probiotics eases the condition.
One review concluded that probiotics  decreased constipation  by 10–40% in older adults, compared with a placebo treatment ( 5 ).
Another review showed that probiotics increased stool frequency, improved stool consistency, and sped the movement of food through the digestive tract ( 6 ).
Other research has observed similar results ( 7 ,  8 ).
Keep in mind that the effects of probiotics on constipation may vary  depending on the strain  ( 9 ).
Furthermore, additional research on the effects of kombucha specifically is still needed.
Studies posit that increasing your intake of probiotics may improve stool frequency and consistency to prevent constipation, though research on kombucha itself is still needed.

Helps you stay hydrated
Staying hydrated is crucial for several aspects of your health, including digestion.
In fact, dehydration is a common cause of constipation. That’s because fluid ensures that food and stools are able to pass through the digestive tract efficiently. Fluid also improves stool consistency, making it easier to pass ( 10 ).
Drinking plenty of fluids, such as kombucha, is a great way to  stay hydrated  to prevent constipation.
Although fluid needs vary depending on your age, sex, size, and health status, the U.S. National Academy of Medicine recommends that most adult men and women drink at least 125 and 91 ounces (3.7 and 2.7 liters), respectively,  per day  ( 11 ).
While you shouldn’t depend entirely on kombucha to meet your fluid needs, it can certainly help keep enough fluids in your body to support regularity.
Kombucha can help you stay hydrated, which may help prevent constipation and promote regularity.

The bottom line
Kombucha  is a potentially good source of probiotics, which can promote gut health and prevent constipation.
It can also help keep you hydrated, which is important for improving stool consistency and promoting regularity.
However, note that varieties with added juice or flavoring ingredients can contribute to varying nutrient and calorie contents. Plus, kombucha may contain varying amounts of alcohol, so those requiring alcohol-free beverages should read the label carefully.
In the end, whether kombucha  helps you poop  likely depends on several factors, including your hydration, health status, and current diet.
Try this today:  In addition to kombucha, many other foods and beverages support regularity and gut health. Try experimenting with  fermented foods  like miso, sauerkraut, tempeh, kefir, and yogurt that’s low in added sugar to bump up your probiotic intake.
