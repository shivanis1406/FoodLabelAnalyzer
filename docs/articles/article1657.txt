Title: What Happens If You Mix CBD and Alcohol?


Cannabidiol (CBD) has recently taken the health and wellness world by storm, popping up among the legions of products sold at supplement shops and natural health stores.
You can find CBD-infused oils, body creams, lip balms, bath soaks, protein bars, and more.
Alcohol manufacturers have even jumped on the bandwagon by producing CBD-infused shots, beers, and other alcoholic beverages.
However, many people have questioned the safety of combining alcohol and CBD.
This article reviews the effects of mixing CBD and alcohol.

What is CBD?
Cannabidiol (CBD) is a naturally occurring compound found in the cannabis plant.
Unlike tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in cannabis, CBD doesn’t have any psychoactive properties or cause the high that’s often associated with marijuana use ( 1 ).
CBD oil  is extracted from the cannabis plant and then mixed with a carrier oil, such as coconut, palm, olive, or  hemp seed oil .
In recent years, CBD has gained widespread popularity and is now available in a variety of different forms, including  sprays ,  capsules , food products,  tinctures , and shots.
Promising research suggests that CBD may offer a  variety of health benefits , including aiding pain management,  reducing anxiety , and improving skin health ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
CBD is a compound extracted from the cannabis plant. It’s used to produce supplements in a variety of different forms. Research suggests CBD may reduce pain, decrease anxiety, and promote skin health.

They may amplify each other’s effects
Alcohol  is known for its ability to reduce inhibitions and promote feelings of relaxation ( 5 ,  6 ).
CBD can have similar effects on your body. Research has shown it can reduce anxiety and calm your nerves ( 3 ,  7 ).
For example, one study in 72 people showed that taking 25–75 mg of CBD daily for just one month reduced anxiety and improved sleep quality ( 8 ).
Taking alcohol and CBD together could amplify these effects, potentially causing symptoms like increased sleepiness and sedation.
Some also claim that mixing CBD and alcohol can intensify each other’s effects, resulting in changes in mood and behavior.
In fact, one small study looked at the effects of giving participants 200 mg of CBD alongside 1 gram of alcohol for every 2.2 pounds (1 kg) of body weight.
It observed that combining alcohol with CBD caused significant impairments in motor performance and alterations in the perception of time. Participants did not experience these effects when they took CBD on its own ( 9 ).
Nonetheless, this study is outdated and used a much higher amount of CBD than most people typically use.
Unfortunately, there is very little research on the health effects of taking CBD with alcohol.
CBD and alcohol both promote feelings of calmness and relaxation. Taking them together may amplify these effects. Yet, more research is needed to determine how the two can affect your mood and behavior.

CBD may protect against alcohol’s side effects
Not much is known about the effects of mixing CBD and alcohol.
However, promising research shows that CBD may protect against some of alcohol’s negative effects.
Here are a few ways CBD may impact the effects of alcohol.
Excessive alcohol consumption can cause damage to cells, increasing the risk of inflammation and chronic diseases such as  pancreatitis , liver disease, and certain types of cancer ( 10 ).
Several animal studies have observed that CBD may protect against cell damage caused by alcohol consumption.
For example, one study in rats showed that applying CBD gel to the skin decreased brain-cell damage caused by excessive alcohol consumption by up to 49% ( 11 ).
Another study concluded that injecting mice with CBD helped protect against alcohol-induced  fatty liver disease  by increasing autophagy, a process that promotes the turnover of new cells and leads to tissue regeneration ( 12 ).
One study has shown that CBD-rich cannabis extracts can cause liver toxicity in mice. However, some of the mice in that study had been gavaged, or force-fed, with extremely large amounts of the cannabis extract ( 13 ).
It’s unclear whether CBD has any of these same effects in humans. More studies are needed to know whether CBD can prevent alcohol-induced cell damage in humans.
Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is a measure of the amount of alcohol in your blood. A higher BAC generally correlates with a greater loss of motor control and cognitive function ( 14 ).
There is little research on CBD’s effects on blood alcohol levels.
However, one study in 10 people found that when participants took 200 mg of CBD with alcohol, they had significantly lower blood alcohol levels than when they consumed alcohol with a placebo ( 9 ).
Keep in mind that this study was conducted in the 1970s and used a very large dose of CBD — nearly 5–10 times higher than what is recommended for most people. It’s unclear whether normal doses of CBD would have this effect.
Additionally, other studies have noted conflicting findings. Several animal studies have reported that CBD did not reduce blood alcohol concentration when it was given to animals alongside alcohol ( 15 ,  16 ).
Therefore, more research is needed to determine how CBD may affect blood alcohol levels in humans.
Some researchers believe that CBD could help treat alcohol use disorder.
This is because some animal studies have shown that CBD can help reduce several symptoms of addiction and withdrawal ( 17 ,  18 ).
In fact, one recent study looked at the effects of CBD in alcohol-addicted rats. It found that CBD helped reduce alcohol intake, prevented relapse, and decreased motivation to consume alcohol ( 15 ).
Research in humans is limited. Nevertheless, one study in 24 smokers found that using a CBD inhaler for one week reduced cigarette use by 40%. These results suggest CBD could help curb addictive behaviors ( 19 ).
More high-quality studies are needed to determine whether CBD may help with alcohol addiction in humans.
Animal studies show that CBD may reduce liver and brain-cell damage caused by alcohol. It may also help decrease blood alcohol levels and even help treat alcohol use disorder, though more research is needed.

Should you take CBD and alcohol together?
There is currently not enough research to determine the effects of mixing CBD and alcohol.
Several studies in both humans and animals have found that CBD may reduce some of alcohol’s side effects.
However, there’s limited research on whether taking CBD and alcohol together causes adverse health effects.
What’s more, the effects of CBD vary by individual, so it’s difficult to determine whether mixing CBD and alcohol would affect all people in a similar way.
Additionally, most of the current research focuses on the effects of consuming very high amounts of alcohol with CBD, rather than the effects of consuming a few drinks here and there with CBD.
Thus, not as much is known about the effects of moderate or occasional consumption. For this reason, it’s not advisable to take CBD and alcohol together, especially if you’re unsure how either will affect you.
If you decide to mix CBD and alcohol, stick to low amounts of both to minimize the risk of adverse side effects. Make sure to consult your healthcare provider if you have any concerns.
Because research on the safety of CBD and alcohol is limited, it’s not advisable to take the two together. If you decide to mix CBD and alcohol, stick to low amounts of both to minimize your risk.

The bottom line
CBD and alcohol may amplify each other’s effects, and taking both together in high doses may cause sleepiness and sedation.
However, many human and animal studies show that CBD protects against alcohol-induced cell damage and reduces blood alcohol concentration and addiction and withdrawal symptoms.
One study on mice showed that CBD can increase the risk of liver toxicity. However, some the mice had received high amounts of CBD.
Unfortunately, most of the existing research focuses on animals receiving high amounts of both CBD and alcohol. Not enough research examines the effects of moderate doses in humans.
Until more research is available, it remains unclear whether CBD and alcohol can be combined safely.
Is CBD Legal?   Hemp-derived CBD products (with less than 0.3 percent THC) are legal on the federal level, but are still illegal under some  state laws . Marijuana-derived CBD products are illegal on the federal level, but are legal under some state laws. Check your state’s laws and those of anywhere you travel. Keep in mind that nonprescription CBD products are not FDA-approved, and may be inaccurately labeled.
