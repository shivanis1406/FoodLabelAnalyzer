Title: 14 Tips to Help Overcome Binge Eating

Overeating from time to time is common. But if you find yourself eating more than you’d like on a regular basis, there are plenty of strategies you can incorporate to reduce the likelihood of binge eating.
Temporary discomfort aside, occasional overeating usually isn’t cause for concern.
Many people experience infrequent episodes of binge eating, which occurs when you eat a larger than usual amount in a shorter than usual period. Emotional eating after a breakup, for example, often falls into this category.
While sporadic episodes may be characterized as  disordered eating , certain criteria must be met to receive a diagnosis of  binge eating disorder (BED) .
BED is the  most common  feeding and eating disorder in the United States. It’s important to understand that BED is about more than food; it’s a mental health condition that requires treatment.
Although the tools and strategies discussed below may be recommended alongside a clinical care plan for BED, they aren’t a substitute for professional help.
If you’re preoccupied with food or your weight, feel guilt about food choices, or engage in restrictive diets, consider reaching out for support.
Consider speaking with a healthcare professional or contacting the  National Alliance for Eating Disorders . From 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Eastern on weekdays, you can call  1-866-662-1235  to speak with a licensed therapist.
For general mental health support at any time, call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration at  1-800-662-4357  or  1-800-487-4889  for TTY.

1. Forget about fad diets
Overly restrictive eating methods may trigger episodes of binge eating. A  2010 study  of 496 adolescent girls, for example, found that fasting was associated with a higher risk of binging.
Similarly, a  2005 study  of 103 female participants noticed that abstaining from certain foods resulted in increased cravings and a higher risk of overeating.
Instead of following diets that involve eliminating entire food groups or significantly reducing calorie intake, focus on making  healthy enhancements .
Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and  grains , and moderate your intake of treats rather than excluding them from your diet altogether.

2. Avoid skipping meals
Skipping meals can contribute to  cravings  and increase the risk of overeating.
A small, two-month study  published in 2008  showed that eating one large meal daily increased blood sugar levels and the hunger-stimulating hormone  ghrelin  more than eating three meals daily.
Meanwhile, a  2014 study  of 38 people found that adhering to a regular eating pattern was associated with a decreased frequency of binging.
Try setting a regular eating schedule and do your best to follow it more often than not.

3. Stay hydrated
Drinking plenty of  water  throughout the day can be an effective way to curb cravings and prevent overeating.
One  2008 study  of 24 older adults found that drinking 17 ounces (500 milliliters) of water before eating a meal decreased the number of calories consumed by 13%, compared with a control group.
A  2007 study  in older adults showed that drinking 13 to 17 ounces (375 to 500 milliliters) of water 30 minutes before a meal significantly decreased hunger and calorie intake while increasing feelings of fullness during the day.

4. Practice mindfulness
Mindfulness  involves listening to your body and paying attention to how you feel at the moment. This can help you recognize when you no longer feel hungry and adjust accordingly.
One  2014 review  of 14 studies found that practicing mindfulness meditation decreased the incidence of binge eating and emotional eating.
A small  2012 study  showed that combining mindfulness with  cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)  may improve eating behavior and self-awareness.
Eating slowly  can also help you recognize when hunger begins to taper off.

5. Incorporate yoga
Yoga  involves breathing exercises, poses, and meditation to  reduce stress  and enhance relaxation.
One  2016 study  of 20 girls found that combining yoga with outpatient eating disorder treatment decreased depression, anxiety, and  body image disturbances  — all of which could be factors involved in emotional eating.
If you’re new to the practice, starting slowly with just  a few minutes a day  at home may be helpful. You might also consider taking a class online or in person at a local yoga studio.

6. Add more fiber to your diet
Increasing  fiber intake  could help reduce cravings, appetite, and food intake.
One small, 2-week study  published in 2006  found that supplementing twice daily with a type of fiber found in vegetables decreased hunger and calorie intake while increasing fullness.
A  2009 study  of 10 adults showed that taking 16 grams of  prebiotic  fiber daily increased levels of specific hormones that influence satiety and significantly reduced feelings of hunger.
Fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains are just a few  fiber-rich foods  that can keep you feeling full.

7. Increase your protein intake
Protein-rich foods can also keep you full and help control your appetite.
One  2005 study  of 19 people showed that increasing protein intake from 15% to 30% led to significant reductions in body weight and fat mass and decreased daily calorie intake by an average of 441 calories.
Similarly, a  2006 study  found that following a high protein diet promoted feelings of fullness and increased levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a hormone known for its ability to suppress appetite.
Try including at least one source of protein — such as meat, eggs, nuts, seeds, or legumes — in each meal, and opt for  high protein snacks  when you feel hungry to keep cravings at bay.

8. Get enough sleep
Sleep affects your hunger levels and appetite. In fact, one  2018 study  of 146 people found that those with BED reported significantly more symptoms of  insomnia  than people without a history of this condition.
A large  2004 study  showed that shorter sleep duration was associated with higher levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin and lower levels of  leptin  — the hormone responsible for promoting fullness.
Aim to squeeze in at least  8 hours of sleep  most days of the week.

9. Start your day with a meal
Eating a fiber- and protein-rich  breakfast  can help curb cravings and keep you satiated throughout the morning.
One  2006 study  of 15 people found that eating a  high protein  breakfast reduced ghrelin levels to a greater extent than eating a high carb breakfast.
Meanwhile, a  2013 study  of 48 people found that eating fiber- and protein-rich oatmeal improved appetite control and promoted fullness.
For your first meal of the day, try combining a few high fiber foods, such as fruits, vegetables, or whole grains, with a rich source of protein.

10. Stay physically active
Adopting a new  exercise routine  or increasing physical activity levels could help prevent overeating.
An  older 6-month study  of 77 people showed that increasing weekly exercise frequency stopped binge eating in 81% of participants.
A  2002 study  of 84 women found that pairing CBT with regular exercise significantly reduced the frequency of binging episodes  than therapy  alone.
Research  also suggests  that exercise can decrease stress levels and enhance mood to prevent emotional eating.
Walking, running, swimming, and biking are just a few different forms of physical activity you might consider incorporating into your overall movement practice.

11. Clean out the kitchen
Having a surplus of  less nutritious foods  in the house can make it much easier to snack without moderation.
Start by clearing out processed snack foods like chips, candies, and pre-packaged convenience foods and swapping them for healthier alternatives.
Stocking your kitchen with fruits, vegetables, protein-rich foods, whole grains,  nuts , and seeds can improve your diet and reduce your risk of overeating less nutritious foods.

12. Give meal planning a shot
Planning ahead can help ensure you have healthy ingredients to  prepare a variety  of nutritious meals. In fact, a  2017 study  of over 40,000 adults showed that meal planning was associated with improved diet quality.
Meal planning  may also help you to stick to a regular eating pattern, which  has been linked  to fewer episodes of binge eating.
To get started, consider planning a few meals a week — alternating between two different breakfast options, for example.
Once you feel comfortable identifying recipes in advance and picking up groceries to support this level of planning, you might consider  adding another meal  to your rotation.

13. If it makes sense for you, consider keeping a food journal
Keeping a  journal that tracks  what you eat and how you feel can be an effective tool. It can help identify potential emotional and food triggers and promote healthier eating habits.
One  2017 study  of 17 people showed that using an online self-help program that involved keeping a food diary was associated with fewer self-reported episodes of binge eating.
However, food tracking isn’t for everyone. In some cases, tracking your meals can increase the risk of disordered eating habits or contribute to an eating disorder.
If you have more serious concerns about your eating patterns or suspect that they could be related to an underlying condition, such as BED, consider making an appointment with a healthcare professional to discuss your options.

14. Lean on loved ones for support
Talking with a friend or peer when you feel like binging may help reduce your likelihood of overeating.
One  2018 study  of 101 adolescents undergoing  sleeve gastrectomy  showed that reliable social support was associated with fewer episodes of binge eating.
A positive social support system is thought to reduce the impact of  stress , which may help  decrease your risk  of other coping habits like emotional eating.
If you don’t have someone in your life that you feel you can talk with,  helplines  are available free of charge.

The bottom line
While the strategies above can be useful, a treatment plan designed by a professional may be needed to help overcome binging.
CBT is often recommended to explore the connection between thoughts, feelings, and eating patterns. This can help your healthcare professional recommend the appropriate strategies for modifying this behavior.
Other types of therapy used to treat binge eating include dialectical behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and behavioral weight loss therapy.
Antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and certain stimulants are also sometimes used, though more research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of these medications.
