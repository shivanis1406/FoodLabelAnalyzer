Title: Aloe Vera for Weight Loss: Benefits and Side Effects

Aloe vera is a succulent plant known for its medicinal properties. Some people claim that it could promote weight loss. However, no research in humans has found a link between aloe vera and weight loss.
Aloe vera is  most commonly  used topically to heal burns and promote skin health, and it has also been used to help treat various other health conditions.
In recent years, aloe vera has become a key ingredient in juices, herbal supplements, and diet drinks geared toward weight loss.
However,  no research  has found that aloe vera may cause weight loss.
Keep reading to learn more about the possible mechanisms and side effects of aloe vera for weight loss, as well as how to use it.

Potential benefits
Some animal studies have identified several possible ways  aloe vera  may contribute to weight loss.
However, it’s important to note that animal studies alone cannot confirm whether a weight loss remedy is effective. Human research is needed to determine aloe vera’s effects on weight loss.
A  2020 animal study  found that an oral solution of aloe vera gel extract may help activate  brown fat  in mice with obesity.
This  type of body fat  burns fatty acids to help keep you warm, a process known as thermogenesis that may contribute to burning more calories.
Despite these findings, the researchers note that more studies are needed to support the possible ways aloe vera may play a role in fat loss.
Some animal studies have found that aloe vera may  boost the metabolism , which could increase the number of calories you burn throughout the day.
In a  2012 rodent study , administering dried aloe vera gel to rats on a high fat diet reduced body fat accumulation by increasing the number of burned calories.
Similarly, a  2014 review  found that animal research has shown that aloe vera could affect the metabolism of fat and sugar in the body while preventing the accumulation of belly fat.
Still, more studies are needed to determine whether aloe vera may offer similar health benefits in humans.
A  2022 rodent study  found that an aloe vera fermented beverage may play a role in reducing diet-related obesity in mice by helping:
improve the gut microbiome
reduce total cholesterol, body fat, and certain lipids
However, no studies on humans have found that aloe vera beverages could support weight loss.
According to a  2022 review , several studies have found that aloe vera may help improve  blood sugar management .
A  2015 study  in 72 people with  prediabetes  found that consuming capsules containing 300 to 500 milligrams of aloe vera twice daily helped reduce blood sugar levels.
Similarly, a  2013 study  in 136 people found that taking an aloe vera gel complex for 8 weeks reduced body weight and body fat and improved the body’s ability to use insulin, a hormone involved in blood sugar control.
Improving blood sugar management  may help  prevent spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels. These are associated with increased hunger and cravings, which may lead to weight gain.
Despite this possible association, no studies have found that blood sugar management from aloe vera could directly impact weight loss.

Side effects
Aloe vera intake has been associated with several side effects.
The most common side effects of taking aloe vera orally  include  diarrhea, nausea, and stomach cramps. In some cases,  excessive use  of aloe vera may cause inflammation of the liver ( acute hepatitis ).
The  National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health  notes that aloe vera may not be safe if you’re pregnant or nursing. This succulent may also reduce the absorption of certain medications.
It’s important to avoid eating aloe vera skin gels and products, as they may contain ingredients and additives that should not be ingested.
Finally, products containing aloe vera latex, a substance found within the leaves of the aloe vera plant, have been banned by the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  due to safety concerns.
Consider speaking with a healthcare professional before taking aloe vera orally for weight loss, especially if you have an underlying health condition or are taking medications. They could help determine whether aloe vera is safe for you and provide alternative remedies for weight loss that may be more effective.

How do you use aloe vera for weight loss?
No research has determined a specific way to use aloe vera for weight loss.
Aloe vera leaves comprise three main parts — the skin, latex, and gel.
The gel is  safe to consume  and can be prepared by cutting the leaf in half and using a spoon or knife to scoop out the gel.
Be sure to wash the gel thoroughly to remove any dirt and latex residue, which can give the gel a bitter taste.
Try adding the gel to smoothies, shakes, salsas, and soups to bolster the health benefits of your favorite recipes. You can also eat the skin of the aloe leaf by adding it to salads and stir-fries.
After slicing and washing the skin, you may wish to soak the leaves for 10 to 30 minutes before adding them to your recipes to help soften them up.
