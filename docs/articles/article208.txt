Title: 5 Foods That Can Cause Constipation

Many foods have been shown to cause or worsen constipation. Making changes to your diet and reducing your intake of certain foods can help promote regularity.
Constipation is a common problem caused by a lack of dietary fiber. It can be uncomfortable and painful to deal with due to accompanying symptoms, such as bloating and gas.
The older or more physically inactive you get, the more likely you are to experience it.
Some foods can help relieve or reduce the risk of constipation, while others can make it worse.
Here are 5 foods that can cause constipation.

1. Alcohol
Alcohol  is frequently mentioned as a likely cause of constipation.
This is because drinking alcohol in large amounts can increase the amount of fluids lost through your urine,  causing dehydration .
Difficulty keeping the body hydrated, either from not drinking  enough water  or losing too much water through urine, is often linked to an  increased risk  of constipation.
These side effects may vary from person to person. It is important to drink alcohol in moderation and drink water when you do choose to consume alcohol.

2. Gluten-containing foods
Grains like wheat, barley, and rye contain a protein called  gluten . Some people  may experience  constipation when they eat foods that contain gluten.
You can also be intolerant to gluten. This is a condition known as gluten intolerance or  celiac disease .
If you have celiac disease and you consume gluten, your immune system may attack your gut, severely harming it. For this reason, if you have this disease, you should follow a  gluten-free diet .
In the United States, an estimated  0.5%  of people have celiac disease, but many may not be aware of it. Chronic (long-term) constipation is one of the most common symptoms of the condition. Avoiding gluten can help relieve and heal your gut.
Non-celiac gluten sensitivity  and  irritable bowel syndrome  are conditions in which your gut may react to wheat. Individuals with these medical conditions aren’t intolerant to gluten but may be sensitive to wheat and other grains.
If you suspect gluten is causing your constipation, consider speaking with a healthcare professional to rule out celiac disease before cutting gluten from your diet.
This is important, as you must consume gluten to test for celiac disease effectively. If you’ve ruled out celiac disease, it may be helpful to experiment with consuming different levels of gluten to evaluate its effects on you.

3. Processed grains
Processed grains and their products, such as white bread, white rice, and white pasta, are low in fiber and  may cause more constipation  than whole grains.
That’s because processing removes the bran and germ parts of the grain. In particular, the bran contains  fiber , a nutrient that adds bulk to your stool and helps it move along.
Many studies have linked a higher fiber intake to a lower risk of constipation. A small  2022 study  involving 25 adults with constipation found that a high fiber intake significantly decreased the severity of their constipation.
Therefore, if you experience constipation, you may benefit from gradually reducing the intake of processed grains and replacing them with whole grains. It is also important to know that as you increase your fiber intake, you should also increase your fluid intake. This is because fiber draws water into the gut, and if you are not drinking enough water, it can worsen your condition.

4. Dairy products
Dairy  is another common cause of constipation, at least for some people.
Infants, toddlers, and children appear  particularly at risk , possibly due to a sensitivity from cow’s milk.
A  2021 randomized clinical trial  reported that proteins found in cow’s milk could also slow down bowel movements and lead to inflammation and constipation.
It’s worth noting that people with  lactose intolerance  may experience diarrhea, rather than constipation, after consuming dairy.

5. Fried or highly processed foods
Eating large or frequent portions of fried or highly processed foods may also  increase the risk  of constipation. Examples include frozen pizza, canned chili, and french fries.
That’s because these foods tend to be high in fat and low in fiber, a combination that can slow digestion. This can further increase the likelihood of constipation by reducing the total amount of fiber consumed per day.
Fried and highly processed foods tend to contain large amounts of salt, which can lower the water content of your stool, drying it up and making it harder to push through your body.
If you eat too much  salt , your body sucks up water from your intestines to help compensate for the extra salt in your bloodstream. This is one way your body works to bring its salt concentration back to optimal, but it can also lead to constipation.
You can replace snacks like chips, cookies, and ice cream with more fiber-rich snack options, such as fruits and vegetables in your diet.

The bottom line
Constipation is an unpleasant condition that’s relatively common.
If you have constipation, you can achieve smoother digestion by making some simple changes to your diet.
Start by avoiding or reducing your intake of constipation causing foods, such as dairy products and foods containing gluten.
If you’re still experiencing difficulties after reducing your intake of constipation causing foods, consider speaking with a healthcare professional about additional lifestyle and dietary strategies.
