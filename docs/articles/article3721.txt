Title: 9 Healthy Nuts That Are Low in Carbs

Most nuts can easily fit into a low carb eating plan, but some are particularly low in carbs. Read on for 9 great low-carb options.
Nuts are known for being high in healthy fats and protein but low in carbs.
If you’re following stricter low carb diets like the  ketogenic diet , sticking to nuts that are lower in carbs may be especially beneficial.
Here are 9 nuts perfect for a low carb eating plan.

1. Pecans
Pecans are loaded with an array of important nutrients like thiamine, magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc.
They’re also very low in carbs, delivering a little over 1 gram of  net carbs  per 1-ounce (28-gram) serving.
Often referred to as digestible carbs, the term “net carbs” refers to the number of carbs in a food minus the fiber content.
Because your body doesn’t easily absorb naturally occurring fiber in whole foods, it can be subtracted from a food’s total carb content to determine the number of net carbs.
One ounce (28 grams) of  pecans  contains:
Total carbs:  4 grams
Net carbs:  1 gram
Percent of calories from carbs:  8%
Pecans are also rich in  soluble fiber , a type of dietary fiber. According to  research , dietary fiber has been shown to reduce blood sugar levels.
Studies  have also found that it improves other blood markers linked to heart disease, including high LDL cholesterol levels.
One study  had 56 adults with hypercholesterolemia add pecans into their diets or substitute pecans for another food with a similar amount of calories.
It found that both groups experienced significantly reduced heart disease risk factors, such as LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, compared to the control group.
Pecans are low carb nuts that may help regulate blood sugar levels and reduce certain risk factors for heart disease.

2. Macadamia nuts
Macadamia nuts are highly nutritious and make a great addition to low carb meal plans.
They contain B vitamins, magnesium, iron, copper, and  manganese .
One ounce (28 grams) of  macadamia nuts  contains:
Total carbs:  4 grams
Net carbs:  2 grams
Percent of calories from carbs:  8%
These buttery-tasting nuts are also rich in  monounsaturated fats .
According to researchers , foods high in monounsaturated fats benefit heart health by regulating cholesterol levels and reducing inflammation.
Macadamia nuts are rich in healthy fats, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. Including these low carb nuts in your diet may boost heart health and reduce inflammation.

3. Brazil nuts
Brazil nuts are large, low carb nuts that are loaded with important nutrients.
They’re also one of the best natural sources of  selenium  available. In fact, just one Brazil nut delivers over 100% of the recommended Daily Value. The  NIH  recommends that adults consume 55 mcg of selenium per day.
Additionally, they’re high in fiber and low in carbs.
One ounce (28 grams) of  Brazil nuts  contains:
Total carbs:  3 grams
Net carbs:  1 gram
Percent of calories from carbs:  8%
According to  research , selenium is a mineral involved in many critical bodily functions, including metabolism, reproduction, and thyroid function.
One  study  found that Brazil nut consumption had a modest effect on oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. However, more research is needed.
Brazil nuts are low in carbs and considered one of the best natural sources of selenium, a mineral that’s essential for health.

4. Walnuts
Walnuts are not only low in carbs but also loaded with nutrients, including B vitamins, iron, magnesium, zinc, antioxidants, and fiber.
One ounce (28 grams) of  walnuts  contains:
Total carbs:  4 grams
Net carbs:  2 grams
Percent of calories from carbs:  8%
According to  researchers , eating  walnuts  on a regular basis has been shown to improve heart health, reduce the risk of cancer and type 2 diabetes, and even increase life expectancy.
Walnuts are a good source of polyphenols, which have anti-carcinogenic and anti-inflammatory effects.
Walnuts are also high in healthy fats, including a plant-based source of essential  omega-3 fats  called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).
One  study  found that increasing dietary ALA may be linked to a 10% lower risk of heart disease, reduced LDL cholesterol, reduced blood pressure, and reduced triglycerides.
Walnuts are low in carbs and rich in heart-healthy fats. Adding walnuts to your diet may promote weight loss, protect against heart disease, and improve blood sugar management.

5. Hazelnuts
Hazelnuts  are rich in heart-healthy fats, fiber, vitamin E, manganese, and vitamin K.
They’re also low in net carbs and can be easily incorporated into a low carb diet.
One ounce (28 grams) of  hazelnuts  contains:
Total carbs:  5 grams
Net carbs:  2 grams
Percent of calories from carbs:  10%
Hazelnuts are high in L-arginine, an  amino acid  that’s a precursor to nitric oxide. According to  research , nitric oxide is a molecule that promotes heart health by improving blood flow and lowering blood pressure.
Hazelnuts are also rich in fiber and monounsaturated fats, both of which are beneficial for heart health.
Hazelnuts are an excellent source of antioxidants and contain heart-healthy nutrients like L-arginine, fiber, and unsaturated fats.

6. Pine nuts
Sourced from the cones of pine trees, pine nuts have a distinctive flavor and buttery texture due to their high oil content.
They contain vitamins E and K, magnesium, zinc, copper, and phosphorus.
One ounce (28 grams) of  pine nuts  contains:
Total carbs:  4 grams
Net carbs:  3 grams
Percent of calories from carbs:  8%
Pine nuts contain pinolenic acid, which  studies  have found to have anti-inflammatory and weight-lowering properties.
Try adding pine nuts to homemade trail mixes, sprinkling them on salads, toasting them, or eating them raw for a simple snack.
Pine nuts are packed with nutrients and may help support heart health and weight management.

7. Peanuts
Though peanuts are technically legumes, they’re commonly considered nuts and often enjoyed the same way.
Peanuts contain a wide array of nutrients, including folate, vitamin E, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, and copper.
They’re also an excellent source of  plant-based protein , delivering 7 grams in a single serving.
One ounce (28 grams) of  peanuts  contains:
Total carbs:  6 grams
Net carbs:  4 grams
Percent of calories from carbs:  14%
According to  research , peanut consumption is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancer, and inflammation.
Studies  have shown that eating peanuts may benefit weight management. However, more research is needed.
Since they’re high in protein and have a pleasant, mild taste, peanuts make an excellent and filling ingredient that can be paired with various healthy foods.
Peanuts are high in protein, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Eating peanuts may benefit heart health and promote weight management.

8. Almonds
Almonds are low carb nuts that pack a powerful nutritional punch.
They contain vitamin E, magnesium, riboflavin, copper, phosphorus, and manganese.
One ounce (28 grams) of  almonds  contains:
Total carbs:  6 grams
Net carbs:  3 grams
Percent of calories from carbs:  15%
They are also high in protein, delivering 6 grams per serving.
Research  has shown that a diet rich in almonds promotes weight management and protects against diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.
Whole  almonds  pair well with a variety of foods and are a convenient option for snacking on the go.
Additionally, almonds can be used to make other low carb ingredients.
For example,  almond flour  is a popular substitute for traditional all-purpose flour and can be used to create lower carb versions of recipes like pancakes, muffins, and crackers.
Almonds are a good source of protein and several other important nutrients. Studies show that eating almonds could decrease appetite and support weight loss.
