Title: Vegetarian Foods That Are Loaded with Iron

Certain vegetables, including potatoes and leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and legumes, can help you achieve your necessary iron intake on a vegetarian diet.
Iron is a necessary nutrient for many bodily functions. Iron is found in either heme or non-heme forms: heme comes from animal products, and non-heme comes from plants.
An iron deficiency can cause low energy,  breathlessness , headaches, irritability, dizziness, or  anemia .
The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for males assigned at birth (MAAB) and females assigned at birth (FAAB) is about  8–18 milligrams (mg)  of iron per day, depending on your age and sex.
Children and adolescents may need more or less depending on their age, and the amount you need can also vary from person to person. For people who are breastfeeding or pregnant, your needs increase to 9–27 mg per day.
The following tables include plant  foods high in iron  based on the standard 8 mg RDA for adults. If you are  vegetarian and vegan , your RDA is 1.8 times higher (14.4–32.4 mg daily) because non-heme iron from plants doesn’t absorb as well as heme iron from animal products.

3. What vegetables are high in iron?
Vegetables often have higher iron content than meats and eggs, though non-heme iron is less easily absorbed. To maximize  iron absorption , consume them cooked and with  vitamin C-rich foods .
Tomatoes contain more iron when dried or concentrated, and potatoes have higher iron when unpeeled in their skins. Sweet potatoes offer a good amount of iron even when peeled.

5. What whole grain foods contain the most iron?
While  whole grains  have various health benefits, not all grains are equally beneficial.
For instance, grain processing and refining  typically removes  parts of the grain that contain fiber, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals — including iron.
For this reason, whole grains typically contain more iron than refined grains. That said, most refined grain products are fortified with iron, so they can still be good sources.
The following are types of whole grains containing the most iron per portion.

6. What other foods contain the most iron?
Certain foods do not fit in one of the food groups above yet contain significant amounts of iron. Adding them to your diet can help you meet your recommended daily iron intake.

How can I increase iron absorption from plant foods?
Various strategies can help you increase your body’s ability to absorb non-heme iron. Here are the best-researched methods:
Eat vitamin C-rich foods:  Consuming vitamin C-rich foods at the same time as foods rich in non-heme iron can  help increase  iron absorption.
Avoid coffee and tea with meals:  Drinking coffee and tea  can reduce  iron absorption.
Soak, sprout, and ferment:  Soaking, sprouting, and fermenting grains and legumes  can improve  iron absorption by lowering the amount of  phytates  naturally present in these foods.
Use a cast iron pan:  Foods prepared in a cast iron pan  may provide  more iron than those prepared in non-iron cookware.
Consume lysine-rich foods:  Plant foods like legumes and quinoa are rich in the amino acid  lysine  and  may increase  iron absorption.
