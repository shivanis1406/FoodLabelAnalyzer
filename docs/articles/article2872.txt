Title: What Is Smooth Move Tea, and Does It Aid Weight Loss?

Smooth Move tea is an herbal blend commonly used as an over-the-counter constipation remedy.
Senna, its primary ingredient, has been utilized as a natural laxative for centuries.
Some people may also drink this tea to ease bloating or promote weight loss. Yet, it may have several unpleasant side effects and isn’t suitable for everyone.
This article tells you everything you need to know about Smooth Move tea, including whether it promotes weight loss.

What is Smooth Move tea?
Smooth Move tea is a blend of  organic  herbs marketed as a natural laxative. It’s said to help relieve constipation within 6–12 hours.
Its main ingredient is senna, a powerful plant native to Africa and India. Its natural laxative properties make it a popular addition to constipation-relief remedies ( 1 ).
Sennosides, the active chemical compounds in senna, cause your bowels to contract and help increase the amount of water and electrolytes present in your colon, which further aid bowel movements ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
Smooth Move tea also contains licorice, bitter fennel, cinnamon, ginger,  coriander , and sweet orange.
These herbs are meant to soothe your bowels, reducing your chances of cramping.
To make a cup of Smooth Move tea, pour 8 ounces (240 ml) of boiling water over your tea bag, cover your mug, and steep for 10–15 minutes.
Smooth Move tea is made from a blend of herbs including senna, a natural laxative. It’s advertised to relieve constipation within 6–12 hours.

Is it effective for weight loss?
People sometimes use laxative teas like Smooth Move for weight loss.
This type of tea triggers bowel movements and prevents your body from reabsorbing water from your colon. As such, it can help clear out your bowels and promote fluid loss, which may  reduce bloating  and help you feel lighter ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
However, any weight loss will be almost exclusively due to the loss of water and stools — not fat. What’s more, you’re likely to regain this weight as soon as you stop drinking the tea.
What’s more, long-term use of laxative teas has been linked to  electrolyte imbalances  and other health issues. As it may cause your bowels to become dependant on laxatives to function properly, long-term use is not recommended ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ).
Laxative teas like Smooth Move may temporarily reduce your weight by flushing water and stools out of your body. However, they’re unlikely to help you lose body fat, and long-term use is likely detrimental to your health.

Potential benefits
Smooth Move tea may provide several health benefits.
Senna, the main ingredient in Smooth Move tea, has been used as a  natural laxative  for centuries. It bulks, softens, and increases the frequency of stools ( 1 ,  3 ).
In a 28-day study, 86 nursing-home residents drank either Smooth Move tea or a placebo once per day. Those in the Smooth Move group had 4 times as many bowel movements, on average ( 7 ).
Smooth Move tea may also help prevent hemorrhoids by reducing the amount of straining needed during bowel movements. However, despite popular belief, there’s no evidence that this tea reduces any other symptoms of hemorrhoids ( 8 ).
Smooth Move tea and other senna-containing products may safeguard against certain types of infections.
Test-tube and animal research shows that senna may fight various parasites and bacteria, even offering some protection against malaria ( 9 ,  10 ).
Several of the other ingredients in this tea, including licorice root and  fennel , may also help fend off bacteria and viruses ( 11 ,  12 ).
Nonetheless, human research is needed before strong conclusions can be made.
The ingredients in Smooth Move tea are  rich in antioxidants . These beneficial plant compounds help protect against cellular damage and may fight conditions like cancer and heart disease.
Senna, the main component of Smooth Move, is particularly rich in flavonoids, a type of antioxidant linked to improved brain and gut health, as well as a lower risk of heart disease ( 1 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ).
Other ingredients, such as licorice root and  cinnamon , may help reduce inflammation, while ginger may fight nausea and menstrual pain ( 16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  19 ,  20 ).
However, it’s unclear whether a single teabag of Smooth Move offers the same benefits as larger doses of each ingredient on its own. Thus, more studies are needed on the tea itself.
Smooth Move tea helps relieve constipation. It may also fight infections and offer other benefits, though more research is necessary.

Is it safe?
Smooth Move tea may cause some side effects and may not be suitable for everyone.
Short-term use of Smooth Move tea is generally considered safe.
Yet, some people have reported side effects, such as painful cramping, diarrhea, fluid losses, poor nutrient absorption, and changes in urine color ( 21 ).
Consuming senna-containing products in high doses or for long periods isn’t recommended, as it may lead to liver damage, electrolyte imbalances, and  severe dehydration . It may also cause laxative dependence and worsen hemorrhoids ( 5 ,  6 ,  21 ).
Smooth Move’s manufacturer recommends that you drink only 1 cup (240 ml) per day for no longer than 1 week at a time.
Senna may also interact with certain drugs and herbal supplements, including diuretics, hormone-replacement therapy,  licorice , or other laxative herbs. Therefore, it’s best to talk to your healthcare provider before taking Smooth Move ( 21 ).
Senna-containing products aren’t recommended for children under 2 years of age, as they’re linked to severe diaper rash, blisters, and skin sloughing ( 22 ,  23 ).
Smooth Move’s manufacturer specifically discourages giving this tea to children under 12 years and suggests discontinuing its use if you experience abdominal pain,  nausea , or vomiting.
Moreover, it’s best to avoid Smooth Move if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, as little is known about its safety in these populations.
This tea may also lead to risks for people with certain medical conditions, such as appendicitis, heart disease, intestinal obstruction, Crohn’s disease, or ulcerative colitis. If you have any of these conditions, steer clear of Smooth Move ( 5 ).
Smooth Move tea is likely safe for short-term use but has been linked to various side effects, such as diarrhea and cramping. It should be avoided by certain populations, such as young children and pregnant or breastfeeding women.

The bottom line
Smooth Move is an herbal tea that contains senna, a natural laxative.
This blend  relieves constipation  and may also fight infections, reduce inflammation, and protect against certain diseases.
That said, Smooth Move is unlikely to aid long-term  weight loss , and its continued use may lead to numerous health issues. Young children, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and people with certain medical conditions should avoid it.
If in doubt, discuss Smooth Move tea with a healthcare professional before use.
