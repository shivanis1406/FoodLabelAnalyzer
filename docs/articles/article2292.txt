Title: Weight Watchers for Men: Overview and Dietitian Review

Weight Watchers — now known as WW — is a popular weight loss program that has attracted millions of subscribers over the past few decades.
It’s favored for its flexibility, ease, and effectiveness, along with the fact that no foods are off-limits as part of the plan.
Although the program was originally designed specifically for women, many men have started using WW to lose weight and improve their health.
This article takes a closer look at Weight Watchers for men, along with some of the benefits and downsides.

What is Weight Watchers for men?
WW, formerly known as Weight Watchers, is a  weight loss program  that was founded by entrepreneur Jean Nidetch in 1963.
Originally, the program was based on a food-exchange system in which dieters were allotted a certain number of servings from certain food groups each day.
During the 1990s, the brand replaced the exchange system with the SmartPoints system, in which foods and drinks were assigned a specific number of points based on their nutritional value.
In November 2021, the brand launched the new PersonalPoints program, which allows dieters to complete a quiz when signing up to create their own custom plan and determine their daily PersonalPoints budget.
Like the regular program, WW for men is based on the same principles and centered on the PersonalPoints system.
However, men are typically assigned a few extra points to use per day, depending on their age, height, and weight.
Members are also assigned a certain number of ZeroPoint foods — foods that don’t count toward your daily point budget.
Your customized list of ZeroPoint foods is determined using the PersonalPoints Engine. The foods are tailored to your needs and preferences and may include fruits, veggies, and  lean proteins .
Users log both their food intake and their physical activity on either the WW app or the website, which also features healthy recipes, workout videos, and access to an online community.
Add-ons to the base plan, such as weekly workshops and personal coaching, are also available.
WW is a weight loss program that uses the PersonalPoints system to assign a point value to foods. WW for men is the same as the regular program, but men are given a few extra points to use per day.

How it works
When starting the program, dieters are given a specific number of daily points based on their height, weight, age, and weight loss goals.
Foods and drinks are assigned a PersonalPoints value based on the amounts of calories, sugar, saturated fat, and protein they contain.
For example, fruits,  non-starchy vegetables , and lean proteins like chicken and fish contain a low number of points, or even zero points for some plans. Meanwhile, foods high in sugar and saturated fats contain a higher number of points.
No foods are completely off-limits on the diet. Instead, dieters can adjust their portion sizes or modify their other meals during the day so that they can still enjoy their favorite foods.
Users can track their intake on the WW app to ensure that they’re sticking within their daily allotment of PersonalPoints.
Members are also given a weekly allowance of extra points to use on splurges or special occasions. Additionally, there’s an optional setting that allows up to four daily PersonalPoints to roll over into your bank of weekly PersonalPoints.
You can also increase your daily PersonalPoints budget by eating more non-starchy vegetables, drinking enough water, or staying active.
PersonalPoints is the points-based system WW uses to help people make healthier food choices by assigning values to foods based on their  nutritional content .
After signing up and completing an online quiz, dieters are assigned a specific number of PersonalPoints, which they can use toward their meals and snacks each day.
The point values for specific foods can be found on the app. They are also listed directly on the packaging of WW food products.
Certain foods are considered ZeroPoint foods, meaning that they don’t count toward your daily PersonalPoints budget. Users are assigned a custom list of ZeroPoint foods when they sign up for the program.
The amount of PersonalPoints for each food is determined based on its nutritional content. Foods that are high in calories, sugar, and saturated fat contain more points, while foods high in  protein  contain fewer points.
Your daily allotment of PersonalPoints depends on your age, sex, height, and weight and is calculated by the PersonalPoints Engine.
Men, younger people, and those who are taller or have a larger body size are generally assigned a higher daily PersonalPoints budget.
On the other hand, women, older adults, and people who are shorter or have a lower body weight typically have a lower daily PersonalPoints budget.
Weight Watchers for men is based on the PersonalPoints system. Foods and drinks are assigned specific numbers of PersonalPoints based on their nutritional content, and users are given a certain number of points to use each day.

Does WW work?
WW is often used by those who wish to achieve sustainable weight loss.
According to the company, members can expect to lose 1–2 pounds (0.5–1 kg) per week.
In addition to making modifications to your diet, the program encourages other healthy habits, such as incorporating regular physical activity into your routine and developing a  positive relationship with food .
Several large studies have found that the WW program promotes weight loss.
For instance, one large 2015 review of 39 studies showed that people who followed the WW program for 1 year lost at least 2.6% more weight than those in a control group ( 1 ).
Another study in 1,267 people found that those who followed WW for 1 year lost more than twice as much weight as those who received brief nutritional advice and self-help materials ( 2 ).
Plus, though the WW group in the study  regained a bit more weight  after 2 years, the amount of weight loss was still significantly greater in this group than in the group that received nutritional advice ( 2 ).
In addition to modifying your diet, WW encourages other healthy habits. Several studies have found that WW can be beneficial for weight loss.

WW plans and pricing
There are four WW plans to choose from, which vary in price and features.
Here’s a closer look at each plan:
Keep in mind that discounted prices are available for your first month on certain plans, depending on the membership duration you select.
Some plans may offer other incentives, such as a free bodyweight scale that syncs with the WW app.

Potential downsides
Much like the regular WW program, WW for men requires dieters to measure and track most of their food intake, which can be somewhat time consuming and tedious.
Though ZeroPoint foods don’t need to be tracked, other foods still need to be measured and logged.
It can also be expensive, with plans ranging from around $23–$60 per month, depending on whether you opt for access to weekly group workshops or personal coaching.
Additionally, while some people may enjoy the flexibility of the program because it allows them to eat some of their favorite treats occasionally while staying within their points budget, it may not be ideal for those who need a bit more guidance.
In fact, because no foods are completely off-limits on the diet, it’s entirely possible to eat foods high in fat and  sugar  while staying within your daily PersonalPoints budget.
Measuring and tracking your food intake can be time consuming, and the program can become expensive over time. The program may not be the best choice for those who need more guidance on which foods to eat.

Foods to eat and avoid
No foods are completely off-limits on the WW program.
However, some foods are higher in points than others and should be limited to stay within your daily allotment of PersonalPoints.
WW has many ZeroPoint foods, which don’t count toward your daily budget of PersonalPoints.
The selection of ZeroPoint foods on your plan is tailored to your needs and preferences and determined by the PersonalPoints Engine. However, most of these  foods are high in protein  and low in added sugar.
Some foods that are encouraged on WW for men include:
Fruits:  apples, apricots, bananas, berries, grapes, melons, oranges, pears
Vegetables:  broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, carrots, onions, peppers, turnips, mushrooms
Proteins:  skinless poultry, fish, shellfish, eggs, tofu
Legumes:  beans, lentils, chickpeas, edamame
Dairy products:  nonfat plain yogurt, Greek yogurt, and soy yogurt
Condiments:  salsa, sauerkraut, pico de gallo, lemon zest, tomato sauce
Beverages:  water, unsweetened tea,  black coffee
While no foods are completely restricted on WW, some foods contain a high number of PersonalPoints as a result of their content of calories, saturated fat, or sugar.
Some of the foods that should be limited on the diet include:
Salty snacks:  potato chips, pretzels, crackers, microwave popcorn
Sweets:  candy, cookies, cake, chocolate, baked goods
Processed meats:  hot dogs, salami, bologna, beef jerky, ham, canned meat
Sugar-sweetened beverages:  soda, sweet tea, sports drinks,  energy drinks
Foods that are low in sugar and high in protein are encouraged on Weight Watchers, while foods high in saturated fat or added sugar should be limited.

Who should try it?
WW for men may be a good choice for those looking for a program to achieve long-term, sustainable  weight loss .
It’s ideal for people who prefer a more flexible approach, as the diet still allows you to eat out and enjoy your favorite foods in moderation.
The program is also a great option for those with specific dietary restrictions, as users can choose which foods to include in their diet.
It may also be beneficial for those looking to improve other aspects of their health, such as  blood sugar management .
This is because the diet encourages eating foods that are nutrient-dense and low in added sugar, such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and legumes — all of which are often recommended for the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes ( 3 ).
The diet can also help promote weight loss, which can be beneficial for those with other health issues, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, and liver problems ( 4 ).

Alternative weight loss programs for men to consider
There are many weight loss programs and diet patterns that can be  beneficial for men .
Here are a few options to consider:
Mediterranean diet.  Based on the traditional diets of countries like Italy, Greece, and Spain, this plan emphasizes healthy fats, fruits, veggies, and whole grains. It can promote long-term weight loss and may support heart and brain health ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ).
Low carb diet.  Several studies show that  low carb diets  can be an effective strategy for short-term weight loss. What’s more, low carb diets may promote better blood sugar management, especially in people with type 2 diabetes ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ).
Plant-based diet.  Plant-based diets emphasize foods like fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds, and beans and may include animal products in moderation. According to one review, plant-based diets could increase weight loss and improve many other aspects of health ( 12 ).
Noom.  If you prefer a more structured commercial program, consider trying  Noom . It focuses on promoting healthy habits to support long-term, sustainable weight loss and provides individualized support from a virtual health coach ( 13 ,  14 ).
Meal delivery service.  If you don’t have much time to cook, you might consider a  meal delivery service . Many offer plans for specific dietary needs, such as low calorie, low carb, plant-based, or  keto . Some even provide  prepared entrees  for portion control.
Finally, you may also want to consider setting up an appointment with a registered dietitian for a more personalized weight loss approach.

The bottom line
Weight Watchers for men is a program that uses a points system to encourage eating nutrient-dense foods that are low in calories, sugar, and saturated fat.
It’s based on the same principles as the regular  Weight Watchers  program but assigns men additional daily points based on their height, weight, age, and weight loss goals.
Several studies have found that WW can be effective for weight loss, which could also help improve several other aspects of your health.
WW for men may be a good choice for those seeking a flexible diet plan that can be fully customized based on individual food preferences and dietary restrictions.
