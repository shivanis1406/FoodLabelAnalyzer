Title: 40 Healthy Snacks for Hungry Teens

Teens need consistent nutrient-dense meals and snacks to fuel their growing bodies.
Adolescents undergo a period of rapid growth and development that requires optimal intake of both macronutrients (fat, protein, and carbs) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). Plus, proper nutrition may help teens excel in academic and athletic pursuits ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
Yet, many popular snacks are high in refined grains, added sugars, and other ingredients that should be limited in teenagers’ diets ( 5 ,  6 ).
All the same, a variety of wholesome snacks can be purchased premade or easily made from scratch.
Here are 40 healthy snacks for hungry teens.

1–5. Quick, homemade snacks
Many homemade snack recipes are time-consuming, but the following can be prepared in just minutes and provide numerous nutrients.
Nut butter and apple  is a delicious and filling combo. Have your teen spread their favorite nut butter between sliced apple rounds for a fiber- and protein-rich snack.
You can roll the edges in  hemp seeds , chia seeds, or chopped nuts for extra crunch.
Trail mix is an easy, super healthy snack. You or your teen can mix creamy cashews, crunchy almonds, and chewy dried  cherries  with dark chocolate chips for an irresistible combination.
Notably, these ingredients are excellent sources of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that teens need for optimal health.

Hummus is a filling dip made from chickpeas. It’s packed with fiber, magnesium, folate,  manganese , healthy fats, and protein ( 7 ).
Layer the bottom of a Mason jar with a few scoops of  hummus , then fill the jar with sliced veggies like carrots, cucumber, celery, and zucchini for a nourishing snack.
Although teens have an increased need for  calcium  to support their growing bodies, inadequate teen calcium intake is a common issue, especially among teenage girls ( 8 ).
Skewers of whole milk  mozzarella balls  and juicy tomatoes are not only loaded with calcium but also healthy fats, protein, and lycopene — a powerful antioxidant found in tomatoes that’s associated with numerous health benefits ( 9 ).
Bento boxes are food containers with several compartments to keep snacks separated. They allow your teen to mix and match their favorite foods.
Fill a bento box with a variety of foods rich in fiber, healthy fats, and protein. For example, pair a  hard-boiled egg  with veggie sticks, fresh fruit, whole grain crackers, and guacamole.

6–10. Homemade snacks to make ahead of time
If you have a bit more time to spare, try out the following teen-friendly recipes.
Overnight oats  are prepped ahead of time so your teen can eat them right away. You can make snack-sized portions by using small 4-ounce (118-mL) Mason jars.
This particular  recipe  is easy to prepare and combines nutritious ingredients like apples, almond butter, oats, and yogurt.
Chocolatey snacks are a teen favorite.
Unlike most chocolate treats, these chocolate no-bake energy bites are packed with healthy ingredients like oats,  dates , cashews, and almond flour to keep your teen energized between meals.

11–15. High protein snacks
Protein-rich snacks can help your teen stay full between meals. Because this nutrient helps build muscle and maintain optimal health, it’s especially important for teenage athletes, who need more protein than non-active teens ( 4 ,  11 ,  12 ).
Some research indicates that teens’  protein needs  are 20–60% greater than adults’ due to the increased protein demand of growth and development ( 12 ).
The following snacks provide a rich source of protein.
Eggs are an excellent source of protein, as well as  healthy fats  and a variety of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Deviled eggs are a tasty way to boost your teen’s protein intake.
This healthy deviled egg  recipe  uses Greek yogurt.
You or your teen can make a tasty, protein-packed parfait by layering a Mason jar with full fat  Greek yogurt , fresh berries, chopped nuts, and chia seeds. Greek yogurt packs 15 grams of protein per 6-ounce (170-gram) serving ( 13 ).
If your teen enjoys seafood, give these tuna and cheddar bites a try. Tuna is an excellent source of highly absorbable protein and provides  omega-3 fats , which are important for teens’ brain development and function ( 14 ).

16–20. Nut-free snacks
Food allergies are on the rise, and tree nuts and peanuts are some of the  most common allergens . In fact, a recent study found that around 2.2% of children and adolescents in the United States are allergic to peanuts ( 15 ).
Here are some nut-free snacks perfect for teens with allergies.
Crunchy, salty, and packed with plant-based protein, roasted  chickpeas  are a nut-free snack that your teen is sure to love.

Most muffins are loaded with ingredients like added sugar and white flour, both of which should be limited in teenage diets. However, this  recipe  uses wholesome ingredients, such as bananas, rolled oats, and whole milk Greek yogurt.
Their natural sweetness comes from the  bananas  and a dash of maple syrup.
Stick cubes of cheese, whole red or green  grapes , and apple chunks on wooden skewers to create a nutrient-dense, teen-friendly snack that can be prepared in minutes.
Avocados  are high in healthy fats, fiber, magnesium, folate, and potassium. They’re easy for you or your teen to make into creamy guacamole, which can be paired with veggies and tortilla chips ( 16 ).

21–28. Healthy premade snacks
Although homemade snacks are a great option for teens, you can also choose from plenty of nutritious packaged options.
Many companies sell packaged trail mix, as well as salted or unsalted nuts and seeds.

Lärabars
These bars contain less than 6 grams of added sugar per bar:
Purely Elizabeth Granola Bars

Autumn’s Gold Granola Bars
Teens need healthy fat sources in their diets.
Whole milk cheese not only provides calcium, protein, and healthy fats but also important minerals, including zinc and selenium, that support immune health ( 17 ,  18 ,  19 ).
Tillamook  and  Organic Valley  are two companies that make high quality cheese sticks perfect for snacking.
Chips may be scrumptious, but most don’t provide a good source of nutrients for teens.
Yet, some flavorful chips are packed with colorful veggies and boast more fiber than traditional chips.
Shop for  Brad’s Veggie Chips  or  Made In Nature Veggie Pops  online.
Turkey sticks are a jerky alternative made with ground turkey that provide a convenient, portable protein source.
