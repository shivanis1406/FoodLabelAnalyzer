Title: The 12 Best Breakfast Foods to Eat in the Morning

A balanced breakfast typically includes protein, fiber, and a range of nutrients. If you’re looking for a healthy morning meal, try easy options like eggs, whole wheat toast with toppings, nuts, and green tea.
A nutritious breakfast can provide long-lasting energy and keep you full for hours. A good breakfast is typically high in fiber, protein,  healthy fats , and micronutrients.
Some commercial breakfast foods can be high in sugar, refined carbs, and additives. Instead, why not try some nutrient-dense whole-food options?
Here are 12 of the best foods and drinks to enjoy in the morning.

1. Eggs
Eggs  provide protein, which is essential for  muscle growth  and maintenance. It can also keep you  feeling full .
In a  2020 study , people who had eggs and toast for breakfast reported significantly less hunger than those who had bran cereal with milk and orange juice, suggesting a higher protein intake (25 grams versus 11 grams) may promote greater fullness.
The egg group also ate fewer calories at lunch, suggesting that eggs support satiety, or the feeling of being full.
Eggs also  contain :
lutein and zeaxanthin  in  the yolk , antioxidants that  appear to support  eye health and  may have benefits  for skin, liver, eye, and cardiovascular health
choline , a  vital nutrient  for brain and liver health
B vitamins, including folate
vitamin A
iron,  calcium , and other essential minerals
Research from 2021  indicates that, in contrast with previous beliefs, there is no direct evidence that eggs raise  cholesterol levels  in most people, despite their high  cholesterol content . Some evidence suggests they may have a mild protective effect against heart disease.
Eat eggs with other nutritious foods, such as whole grain toast, whole fruit, or sautéed vegetables.

2. Greek yogurt
Greek yogurt  is made by straining whey and other liquid from milk curds, producing a creamy product higher in protein than regular yogurt.
It’s also lower in calories than many other protein sources. A  5.3-ounce container (150-gram) serving  provides 15 grams of protein but only 92 calories.
Other nutrients in Greek yogurt include:
calcium
vitamin B12
zinc
potassium
phosphorus
Certain types  contain probiotics  like Bifidobacteria, which support digestion. To ensure your yogurt contains  probiotics , look for the phrase “contains live and active cultures” on the label.
If you prefer an even creamier, higher-protein yogurt, you can try the Icelandic variety,  skyr .
Eating protein-rich plain Greek yogurt with berries and other fruits  may add  to its  prebiotic and probiotic  properties. Topping with  dried fruit ,  oatmeal , or nuts can add texture, fiber, and other nutrients.

3. Coffee
Coffee  contains caffeine, which promotes alertness and increases physical and mental performance.
It may also  contain  a range of  polyphenols , compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
Research suggests it’s safe for most adults to drink up to 4 cups (946 ml) of coffee daily or up to  400 mg  of caffeine.
During pregnancy, people should consume no more than 200 mg of caffeine daily, as caffeine may increase the risk of complications.
Drink your coffee black  or with dairy or plant-based milk. Try to avoid sugar and flavored syrups or use them sparingly, as too much sugar increases health risks.

4. Oatmeal
Oatmeal comes from rolled or steel-cut oats. It contains a soluble fiber called beta-glucan, which can help lower cholesterol and glucose levels and has antioxidant and prebiotic properties.
Because of how the body processes oats, they also  leave you feeling full  for longer, reducing the temptation to snack mid-morning.
Oats also  provide :
iron
B vitamins
manganese
magnesium
zinc
selenium
In addition, they contain around  10 grams (g)  of protein per cup (81 g) of dry oats. To boost the protein content, make oatmeal with milk instead of water, mix in some protein powder, or serve it with a side of eggs.
You can mix raw oats with dried fruit, nuts, seeds, coconut, and other ingredients for a  homemade muesli .
Oats are suitable for people who cannot eat gluten due to  celiac disease  or  gluten sensitivity. However,  due to the risk of cross-contamination, you should choose oats that have been certified gluten-free.

5. Chia seeds
Chia seeds are a good  source of fiber .
One ounce (28 grams)  of dried chia seeds provides nearly 10 g of fiber.
This fiber is also soluble, which means it absorbs water and increases the volume of food moving through your digestive tract,  making you feel full  longer.
The nutrients in chia seeds may have other benefits, including helping:
managing glucose levels
lowering cholesterol
preventing inflammation
Chia seeds aren’t high in protein, but combining them with Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, or a protein shake can  increase your protein intake , as in the recipe below.
1 ounce (28 grams) of dry chia seeds
1 scoop (25 grams) of  whey protein  powder
1 cup (240 mL) of preferred milk
1/2 cup (74 grams) of berries
stevia or another natural  sweetener  to taste, if desired
Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix well.
Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

6. Berries
Berries  provide a low calorie sweet treat that  tends to be  high in fiber and antioxidants. Popular options include:
blueberries
raspberries
strawberries
blackberries
Berries also offer antioxidants called  anthocyanins , which provide their characteristic blue, purple, and red colors. A diet high in anthocyanins  may help protect  against:
inflammation
heart disease
cancer
type 2 diabetes
other chronic conditions
For a tasty breakfast, you can add berries to Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, oatmeal,  chia pudding , or a fruit  smoothie .

7. Cottage cheese
Low fat  cottage cheese  is a  high protein breakfast  item, providing  24 g  of protein per cup (220 g). For this reason, it is also filling. One  2015 study  found cottage cheese to be as satisfying as eggs.
Cottage cheese is low in calories, providing only  180 calories  per cup (220 g). This means it may also  support weight loss , if that’s your goal.
You can eat cottage cheese with many other nutritious foods, such as:
berries
peaches
tomatoes
cucumbers
chia seeds
ground  flaxseed
granola

8. Whole grain toast
Whole grain toast is  high in  fiber and  complex carbs . These digest slowly, help you feel full for longer, and are less likely to  raise blood sugar levels  than breads or pastries made with white flour.
You can pair whole wheat toast with many foods, including:
mashed egg and tomato
avocado  and chili flakes
unsweetened, whole  peanut butter  and banana
cottage cheese and strawberries
sliced  figs  and honey
tuna
sliced  turkey  or chicken
baked beans
For extra fiber and protein, try  sprouted grain bread , two slices of which provide around  8 grams  of fiber and 10 grams of protein.

9. Nuts
Nuts of all types  provide :
magnesium
potassium
heart-healthy  monounsaturated fat
antioxidants
Their protein, fat, and fiber content also means they can promote fullness.
A  2022 review  concluded that, unless you have a  nut allergy , eating a handful of nuts and seeds daily may help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and other health conditions.
As nuts tend to be high in calories, eating too many could lead to excess weight gain. You may also get the most health benefits from plain nuts without added salt, sugar, or oil.
Topping Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, or oatmeal with a spoonful or two of chopped  nuts  is a great way to increase your breakfast’s nutritional value.

10. Green tea
Green tea  is a soothing drink that gets you going in the morning. It contains  caffeine , but only about half the amount in coffee.
It also contains L-theanine, which promotes a calming effect and may reduce the “jitters” linked to caffeine intake. It may also improve mood and  reduce  anxiety.
Green tea also provides epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), an antioxidant that  may help protect  against neurological disorders, such as  dementia , and cell death.

11. Protein shakes or smoothies
Smoothies  are another great breakfast option. Blend water, dairy milk, or non-dairy milk with nuts, bananas, frozen berries, or other fruits or vegetables for a tasty start to the day.
Adding  protein powder  can increase the protein content. This smoothie- protein shake  combination can promote fullness and reduce hunger while providing a tasty and nutritionally balanced breakfast.
If you work out early in the morning, this may be a better option after exercise than a heavy breakfast.

12. Fruit
Fruits are a light breakfast option, and some whole fruits can make an easy snack during your commute.
All fruits are relatively low in calories and contain fiber, vitamins, minerals, and simple sugars. The fiber in fruit helps slow your body’s absorption of its sugars, giving you a steady energy source. The minerals they contain in large amounts can vary by fruit.
Potassium-rich fruits include:
bananas
oranges
cantaloupe
papaya
mango
Many fruits contain vitamin C,  which acts  as an antioxidant and is crucial to skin health. Fruits high in vitamin C can include:
oranges
guava
kiwi
strawberries
papaya
acerola cherries
lychee
Fruits also provide an array of polyphenol compounds and antioxidants, depending on their color. For instance, guava is high in  lycopene , while purple  plums  contain anthocyanins. Eating a range of fruits of various colors can help boost your intake of a range of antioxidants.
Consuming fruits and vegetables  may reduce  the risk of health conditions such as:
cardiovascular disease
dementia
diabetes
obesity
Whole fruit is  higher in fiber  than  fruit juice , and some commercial fruit juices have  added sugar . For this reason, it’s best to eat whole fruit when possible.
For a balanced breakfast, pair fruit with high protein foods, such as eggs, Greek yogurt, or cottage cheese.
