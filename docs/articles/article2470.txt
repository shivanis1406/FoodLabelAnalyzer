Title: All You Need to Know About the Carnivore (All-Meat) Diet

No controlled studies support claims that the carnivore diet can help eliminate health issues. It lacks beneficial nutrients, including fiber and plant compounds like antioxidants. It may be unsafe for some people.
The carnivore diet consists entirely of meat and animal products, excluding all other foods.
It’s claimed to aid weight loss, mood issues, and blood sugar regulation, among other health issues.
However, the diet is extremely restrictive and likely unhealthy in the long term. Plus, no research backs its purported benefits.
The carnivore diet eliminates all foods except meat and animal products. Thus, it’s low in vitamin c, folate, has no fiber, and is difficult to maintain. You should follow a well-rounded diet instead.
This article reviews the carnivore diet, including what the diet includes, whether it can aid weight loss, and its potential benefits and downsides.

What is the carnivore diet?
The carnivore diet is a restrictive diet that only includes  meat , fish, and other animal foods like eggs and certain dairy products.
It excludes all other foods, including fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains, nuts, and seeds.
Its proponents also recommend eliminating or limiting dairy intake to foods that are low in lactose — a sugar found in milk and dairy products — such as butter and hard cheeses.
The carnivore diet stems from the controversial belief that human ancestral populations ate mostly meat and fish and that high-carb diets are to blame for today’s high rates of chronic disease.
Other popular  low-carb diets , like the keto and paleo diets, limit but don’t exclude carb intake. However, the carnivore diet aims for zero carbs.
Shawn Baker , an American orthopedic doctor, is the most well-known proponent of the carnivore diet.
He cites testimonials from those who follow the carnivore diet as proof that it can treat depression, anxiety, arthritis, obesity, diabetes, and more.
However, no controlled studies have analyzed the effects of the carnivore diet.
One study  promoted by Baker asked followers of the diet to fill out a survey on their eating habits and health. The respondents reported satisfaction and beneficial effects.
However, nutrition experts  raised concerns  about the study’s health claims. For example, the study did not include any way to check the accuracy of the health information submitted by the respondents. The results should be interpreted with caution.
What’s more, in 2017 Baker’s medical license was revoked by the  New Mexico Medical Board  due to concerns about his competency. Baker’s medical license was  reinstated in 2019  with a requirement for direct supervision when practicing medicine.

How to follow the carnivore diet
Following the diet involves eliminating all plant foods from your diet and exclusively eating meat, fish, eggs, and small amounts of  low-lactose dairy products .
Foods to eat include beef, chicken, pork, lamb, turkey, organ meats, salmon, sardines, white fish, and small amounts of heavy cream and hard cheese. Butter, lard, and bone marrow are also allowed.
Proponents of the diet emphasize eating fatty cuts of meat to reach your  daily energy needs , and organ meats such as liver, to ensure intake of vitamins low in other cuts of meat such as  vitamin C .
The carnivore diet encourages drinking water and bone broth but discourages drinking tea, coffee, and other drinks made from plants.
Carnivore diet plans may offer little guidance regarding calorie intake, serving sizes, or how many meals or snacks to eat per day. Most proponents of the diet suggest eating as often as you desire.

Foods to eat
The carnivore diet includes only animal products and excludes all other foods.
Specifically, someone on the carnivore diet can eat:
Meat:  beef, chicken, turkey, lamb, pork, etc.
Organ meats:  Liver, kidney, sweatbread, tripe, heart, brain
Fish:  salmon, mackerel, sardines, crab, lobster, tilapia, herring, etc.
Other animal products:  eggs , lard, bone marrow, bone broth, etc.
Low-lactose dairy (in small amounts):  heavy cream, hard cheese, butter, etc.
Water
According to some proponents of the diet, salt, pepper, and seasonings with no carbs are allowed.
In addition, some people choose to eat yogurt, milk, and soft cheese, but these foods are typically not included due to their carb contents.

Foods to avoid
All foods that do not come from animals are excluded from the carnivore diet.
Restricted foods include:
Vegetables:  broccoli, cauliflower, potatoes, green beans, peppers, etc.
Fruits:  apples , berries, bananas, kiwi, oranges, etc.
High-lactose dairy:  milk, yogurt, soft cheese, etc.
Legumes:  beans, lentils, etc.
Nuts and seeds:  almonds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, pistachios, etc.
Grains:  rice, wheat, bread, quinoa, pasta, etc.
Alcohol:  beer, wine, liquor, etc.
Sugars:  table sugar, maple syrup, brown sugar, etc.
Beverages other than water:  soda, coffee, tea, fruit juice, etc.
While some people incorporate some of these foods, a strict carnivore diet does not permit them.

Can it help you lose weight?
Certain aspects of the carnivore diet may lead to weight loss. Specifically,  some studies  have shown that high-protein and low-carb diets can promote weight loss.
This is mostly because  protein , as well as fat, can help you feel more full after meals, which may lead to reduced calorie intake and subsequent weight loss. Protein can also increase your metabolic rate, helping you burn more calories.
Therefore, following the carnivore diet would likely cause you to feel fuller and eat fewer calories overall — at least in the short term.
One  3-month study in 132 adults  with excess weight or obesity compared the weight loss effects of 4 energy-restricted diets containing varying amounts of carbs and protein.
Those who ate high-protein diets with 0.4–0.6 grams of protein per pound (0.9–1.3 grams per kilogram) of body weight per day lost significantly more weight and fat mass than those who ate 0.2–0.4 grams of protein per pound (0.5–0.9 grams per kilogram) of body weight per day.
Other studies  show similar results, suggesting that increasing protein and dietary fat intake may lead to weight loss and help reduce the amount of weight regained over time.
However, you don’t need to cut all carbs from your diet to see results. Other more well studied diets, like the keto diet and low carbohydrate diet, have been shown to decrease weight gain. In the keto diet, high fat foods replace carbohydrates as an anergy source and contribute to both satiety and weight loss.
Plus, the highly restrictive nature of the carnivore diet makes it difficult to follow long term.

Benefits of the carnivore diet
Due to the limited research on the carnivore diet, it is difficult to state the diet’s benefits. They can only be assumed based on the knowledge we have about other diet and macro nutrients.
For instance, since the carnivore diet excludes carbs, it eliminates cookies, cakes, candy,  sodas , pastries, and similar high-carb foods.
These foods are low in beneficial nutrients and often high in calories. Thus, they should be limited in a healthy, balanced diet.
High-sugar foods  can also be problematic for people with diabetes, as they can spike blood sugar levels. In fact, limiting refined carbs and sugary foods is often recommended to control diabetes.
Due to the removal of highly processed carbohydrates in the carnivore diet, you might see some early benefits such as improved blood pressure, reduced belly fat, and improved cardiovascular health. Whether these benefits are lasting, however, is less clear.
However, the complete elimination of carbs on the carnivore diet is not recommended or necessary for diabetes management. Instead, eating smaller amounts of wholesome, high-fiber carbs that don’t cause spikes in blood sugar is recommended.

Downsides of the carnivore diet
Due to its highly restrictive nature and complete elimination of the majority of food groups, there are many downsides to the carnivore diet.
Given that the carnivore diet consists solely of animal foods, it can be high in saturated fat and cholesterol.
Saturated fat  may raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol, which may increase your risk of heart disease.
However,  recent studies  have shown that the link between saturated fat intake and heart disease risk may not be as strong as previously believed.
Still, consuming high amounts of saturated fat on the carnivore diet may be of concern. No research has analyzed the health effects of eating animal foods exclusively. Therefore, the effects of consuming such high levels of fat and cholesterol are unknown.
Moreover, some  processed meats , especially bacon and breakfast meats, also contain high amounts of sodium.
Eating a lot of these foods on the carnivore diet can lead to excessive sodium intake, which has been  linked to  an increased risk of high blood pressure, kidney disease, and other negative health outcomes.
Red and processed meat intake has also been  linked to  higher rates of certain types of cancer, including colon and rectal cancer.
The carnivore diet eliminates highly nutritious foods like  fruits , vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, all of which contain beneficial vitamins and minerals.
While meat is nutritious and provides many micronutrients, it should not be the only part of your diet. Following a restrictive diet like the carnivore diet may lead to  deficiencies  in some nutrients and the overconsumption of others.
What’s more, diets that are rich in plant-based foods  have been associated  with a lower risk of certain long-term conditions like heart disease, certain cancers, Alzheimer’s, and type 2 diabetes.
This is not only due to the high vitamin, fiber, and mineral contents of plant foods but also their beneficial plant compounds and antioxidants.
The carnivore diet does not contain these compounds and has not been associated with any long-term health benefits.
Fiber , a non-digestible carb that promotes gut health and healthy bowel movements, is only found in plant foods.
Thus, the carnivore diet contains no fiber, which may lead to constipation as a side effect.
Additionally, fiber is incredibly important for the proper balance of bacteria in your gut. In fact, suboptimal gut health can lead to a number of issues and may even be linked to colon cancer.
In fact,  one review  found that a high-protein, low-carb diet may increase your risk for gut inflammation. When your body digests large amounts of protein, it creates potentially harmful byproducts in your gut. These byproducts may have a negative effect on the health of your bowels.
Overall, following the carnivore diet may harm your  gut health .
The carnivore diet may be especially problematic for certain populations.
For example, those who need to limit their protein intake, including people with  chronic kidney disease , should not follow the diet.
Also, those who are more sensitive to the cholesterol in foods, or cholesterol hyper-responders, should be cautious about consuming so many high-cholesterol foods.
Furthermore, certain populations with special nutrient needs would likely not meet them on the carnivore diet. This includes children and people who are pregnant or lactating.
Lastly, those who have anxiety about food or a history of  disordered eating  should not try this diet.

Sample menu
The carnivore diet is difficult to follow long term and does not offer much variety.
Here’s a five-day sample menu for the carnivore diet:
Breakfast:  eggs, bacon, sardines
Lunch:  turkey burger patty, salmon jerky, beef tips
Dinner:  filet mignon, crab, chicken liver
Snacks:  a small amount of Parmesan cheese, jerky
Breakfast:   shrimp , eggs, a small glass of heavy cream
Lunch:  strip steak, tuna fish, beef jerky
Dinner:  lamb chops, scallops, beef liver
Snacks:  a small amount of hard Cheddar cheese,  bone broth
Breakfast:  eggs, salmon, turkey sausage
Lunch:  sweetbreads, pork chops, mackerel
Dinner:  turkey burger patty, a small amount of Parmesan cheese,  bone marrow
Snacks:  hard-boiled eggs, shrimp
Breakfast:  trout, shredded chicken, bacon
Lunch:  beef meatballs, small amount Cheddar cheese, salmon jerky
Dinner:  crab cooked in lard, filet mignon
Snacks : sardines, beef jerky
Breakfast:  eggs, chicken and turkey sausage links
Lunch:  lamb roast, chicken liver, pork chop
Dinner:  flank steak, scallops cooked in butter, a small glass of  heavy cream
Snacks:  bone broth, turkey jerky

The bottom line
The carnivore diet is extremely restrictive, consisting entirely of meat,  fish , eggs, and small amounts of low-lactose dairy.
It’s said to aid weight loss and several health issues, but no reliable research backs these claims.
What’s more, it’s high in fat, contains no fiber or beneficial plant compounds, and is difficult to maintain long term.
Overall, the carnivore diet is unnecessarily restrictive. Eating a  balanced diet  with a variety of healthy foods is more sustainable and will likely afford you more health benefits.
