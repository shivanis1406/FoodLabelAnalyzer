Title: 14 Healthy Breakfast Foods That Help You Lose Weight

Sugary, nutrient-poor breakfast foods can make you feel tired and hungry soon after eating them. To avoid cravings and aid weight loss, choose nutritious options like eggs, yogurt, fruit, vegetables, and healthy grains.
When you’re trying to lose weight, breakfast can set the tone for the rest of your day.
Here are 14 healthy breakfast foods that can help you lose weight.

1. Eggs
Rich in protein  and important vitamins and minerals, such as  selenium  and riboflavin, eggs are a true powerhouse of nutrition.
Research  has also found that thanks to their high protein content, eggs  may help reduce  appetite when eaten with breakfast. This can give weight loss a serious boost.

2. Wheat Germ
Wheat germ  is a component of the wheat kernel that contains a concentrated amount of vitamins and minerals, including manganese, thiamine, and selenium.
It’s also high in  fiber , boasting nearly  4 grams (g) of fiber in each 1-ounce (28-gram) serving .
Research  suggests that eating cereal grains may benefit weight loss, partly because it increases your fiber intake, among other possible mechanisms. However, more  research  is needed to understand how grains affect metabolism and weight.

3. Bananas
High in fiber but low in calories, one medium  banana  has just over 100 calories yet packs 3 g of dietary fiber — knocking out up to  11%  of your daily fiber needs in one shot.
Research  has found that upping your intake of fiber from fruits and vegetables is associated with increased weight loss.
Additionally, unripe bananas are a good source of  resistant starch , a type of starch that your stomach and small intestine don’t digest.  Research  suggests that resistant starch may help reduce food intake and decrease belly fat.

4. Yogurt
Yogurt  makes an excellent addition to a weight-loss diet. In particular, Greek yogurt delivers a hearty chunk of protein in every serving, making it an ideal weight-loss breakfast food.
Research has found that eating Greek yogurt, especially  when combined with exercise  and  as part of an overall balanced diet , may help support weight loss.

5. Smoothies
Smoothies  can give you a concentrated dose of nutrients. Since you can customize your ingredients, you can tailor your drink to fit your personal preferences.
Filling your smoothies with veggies and low calorie fruits can boost your fiber intake,  benefiting  your gut microbiome and helping you feel full longer.
Throw in some high protein ingredients like yogurt, tofu, or protein powder to  promote  fullness and fight off cravings.
However, smoothies can be high in calories if you use too many calorie-dense ingredients. For a simple weight loss smoothie, blend one cup (285 g) of Greek yogurt with some leafy greens, two tablespoons (tbs) or (28 g) of chia seeds, and one cup (144 g) of strawberries.

6. Berries
In addition to  providing  many important vitamins and minerals,  berries  are rich in fiber, which  may help reduce  hunger and food intake.
Eating them regularly may also help  reduce the chance  of developing various diseases, including heart disease and cancer.
Learn about the  healthiest berries you can eat.

7. Grapefruits
Besides being low in calories,  grapefruits  have a  high water and fiber content  — both of which can be beneficial for weight loss.
Research suggests eating citrus fruit  may help people lose or maintain  their weight.
In particular, this may be because citrus fruits like grapefruit contain  polyphenols such as naringenin , which are compounds that can help protect metabolism.
That said, the research on grapefruit is  inconsistent , so more study is needed specifically on this fruit and weight.
If you are taking any drugs, make sure to consult your doctor or pharmacist before eating grapefruit. Certain drugs  may interact  with grapefruit, potentially causing some adverse effects.

8. Coffee
Because of its  caffeine  content,  coffee  may aid weight loss by  boosting  metabolism and fat burning.
Drinking it may  help support weight loss , especially when combined with other strategies such as eating a balanced diet and exercising.
Just make sure not to overdo it with the sugar or creamer, as they add calories and negate some of the coffee’s potential health-promoting properties.

9. Kiwis
High in vitamin C, vitamin K, and  potassium , kiwis are also an excellent source of fiber — just one cup (180 g) provides up to  19%  of your daily needs.
Research  shows eating  kiwis  can help reduce body fat mass, help improve blood pressure, and reduce inflammation in people with obesity.
What’s more, kiwis have been shown to help enhance feelings of fullness,  decrease appetite , and lower blood sugar.
They also act as a  natural laxative  by  stimulating  the movement of your digestive tract to support regularity.

10. Green Tea
Take a look at the ingredients in almost any diet pill or fat-burning supplement, and there’s a good chance you’ll spot  green tea .
Green tea  has been studied  extensively for its metabolism and  fat-burning capacities . For example, a recent  2022 study  found that people who drank more green tea had less belly fat.
Try adding a squeeze of lemon, drizzling on a bit of honey, or brewing your tea with ginger or mint to bring a tasty twist to your cup.

11. Chia Seeds
Chia seeds  are an excellent breakfast supplement. They’re  high in fiber  and can absorb water to form a gel, which expands in your stomach to help keep you feeling fuller longer
They’re also rich in protein, which can  reduce  levels of  ghrelin , the hormone responsible for stimulating hunger.
A  2021 animal study  found that chia seeds may help the body metabolize fat better.
Additional research  on humans found that chia seeds can help support weight loss, though other  research  suggests conflicting results. More studies on chia seeds and weight are needed.

12. Oatmeal
Oats  are low in calories but high in fiber and protein — two nutrients that impact appetite and weight control.
In particular, oats are an  excellent source  of beta-glucan, a type of fiber shown to impact everything from immune function to heart health.
Research shows that beta-glucan  can help  balance  blood sugar levels , working to prevent spikes and crashes that may drive up your appetite.
This means that eating oats  may help  you manage your appetite and avoid overeating, which in turn can support weight loss.
Learn more about  oatmeal and weight.

13. Flaxseeds
Flaxseeds  are loaded with viscous fiber, a type of soluble fiber that  absorbs  water to form a gel in your gut.
Studies show that  soluble fiber  is  especially effective  at slowing digestion, which could help decrease appetite and lower calorie intake to aid weight loss.
Research  suggests that adding flaxseed to your diet can have a powerful effect on weight loss and appetite control.

14. Nuts
Nuts  provide the perfect balance of fiber, protein, and heart-healthy fats. Adding them to your balanced diet  can help  support your weight loss goals.
That said, remember that nuts are also very calorie-dense, so limit your intake to about one ounce (28 g) at a time to keep the calories from stacking up.
