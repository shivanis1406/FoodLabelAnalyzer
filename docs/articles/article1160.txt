Title: High FODMAP Food List

Foods high in FODMAP content, like garlic, onion, baked beans, rye and more, cause digestion issues for certain groups. Try replacing high FODMAP foods with low FODMAP swaps from the same food group to find out if this diet approach is the right fit.
Food is a common trigger of digestive issues. In particular, foods that are high in fermentable carbohydrates can cause symptoms like gas, bloating, and stomach pain in some people.
A group of these fermentable carbohydrates is known as FODMAPs. Foods can be classified as either high or low in these fermentable carbohydrates.
Restricting high FODMAP foods can provide remarkable relief of gut symptoms, particularly in people with  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) .
This article discusses 10 common foods and ingredients that are high in FODMAPs, along with options to replace them with if they’re leading to digestion issues.

High FODMAP meaning
FODMAP  stands for fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides, and polyols. These are the scientific names for carbs that may cause digestive issues.
A food is categorized as  high FODMAP  according to predefined cutoff levels.
Published cutoff levels suggest that a high FODMAP food contains more than one of the  following carbs :
oligosaccharides:  0.3 grams of fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), (0.2 grams for fruits and vegetables)
disaccharides:  1.0 gram of lactose
monosaccharides:  0.15 grams fructose in excess of glucose (0.4 grams for fruits and vegetables when fructose is the only FODMAP present)
polyols:  0.2 grams of either mannitol or sorbitol or 0.4 total polyols
Two universities provide validated FODMAP food lists and apps —  Monash University  and  King’s College London .
FODMAPS  tend to increase water content in the small intestine, increase production of gas through fermentation, and can lead to excess production of short-chain fatty acids.
This can result in abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and alterations in bowel habits in some individuals who eat high FODMAP foods, particularly those with  IBS .
It’s important to be aware that not everyone should avoid FODMAPs. In fact, FODMAPs are beneficial for most people.
First, it is important to  decide whether restricting FODMAPs is right for you . This decision should be made under the guidance of a healthcare professional such as a gastroenterologist (GI) or registered dietician (RD) or other specialist who can help determine if low FODMAP is the right choice. If you do decide the low FODMAP diet is a good fit, be sure to watch for the following 10 foods.

High FODMAP foods
Wheat  is one of the single biggest contributors of  FODMAPs  in the Western diet.
This is because wheat is consumed in large quantities — not because it is a concentrated source of FODMAPs.
In fact, compared to the other nine sources discussed in this article, wheat contains one of the lowest amounts of FODMAPs by weight.
For this reason, foods that contain wheat as a minor ingredient, such as thickeners and flavorings, are considered  low FODMAP .
The most common sources of wheat include bread, pasta, breakfast cereals, biscuits, and pastries.
Suggested low FODMAP swaps:
brown rice
buckwheat
maize
millet
oats
polenta
quinoa
tapioca
Wheat is the main source of FODMAPs in the Western diet. However, it can be replaced with other, low FODMAP whole grains.
Garlic is one of the most concentrated sources of FODMAPs.
Unfortunately, restricting garlic in your diet is notoriously difficult because it’s added to many sauces, gravies, and flavorings.
In processed food, garlic may be listed among the ingredients as flavoring or natural flavor. Therefore, you need to avoid these ingredients if you are following a strict low FODMAP diet.
Fructans  are the main type of FODMAP in garlic.
However, the quantity of fructans depends on whether the garlic is fresh or dried, as dried garlic contains about  three times as many fructans  as fresh garlic.
Despite being high in FODMAPs, garlic is associated with many  health benefits . This is why it should only be avoided in FODMAP-sensitive people.
Suggested low  FODMAP swaps :
garlic-infused oil
garlic scape powder
chili
chives
cilantro
cumin
fenugreek
ginger
lemongrass
mustard seeds
oregano
paprika
saffron
turmeric
Garlic is one of the most concentrated sources of FODMAPs. However, garlic has many health benefits and should only be restricted in FODMAP-sensitive people.
Onions  are another concentrated source of fructans.
Similar to garlic, onion is commonly used to flavor a wide range of dishes, making it difficult to restrict.
Shallots are one of the  highest sources of fructans , while a Spanish onion is one of the lowest sources.
While different varieties of onions contain different amounts of FODMAPs, all onions are considered high FODMAP.
Suggested low FODMAP swaps:
chives
green tops of onions and scallions (not the bulb, which is high in FODMAPs)
leek leaves (not the bulb, which is high in FODMAPs)
asafoetida
Different onion varieties contain varied amounts of FODMAPs, but all onions contain high amounts.
All  fruits  contain the FODMAP  fructose .
But interestingly, not all fruits are considered high in FODMAPs. This is because some fruits contain less fructose than others.
Also, some fruits contain high amounts of glucose, which is a non-FODMAP sugar. This is important because glucose helps your body absorb fructose.
This is why fruits that are high in both fructose and glucose do not typically cause gut symptoms. It’s also why only fruits with more fructose than glucose are considered high FODMAP.
Nevertheless, even low FODMAP fruits can cause gut symptoms if they’re consumed in large quantities. This has to do with the total fructose load in your gut.
Therefore, sensitive people are encouraged to eat only one portion of fruit per sitting, or approximately 3 ounces (80 grams).
High FODMAP  fruits include:
apples
apricots
blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries, depending on quantity
cherries
figs
grapes
mangoes
nectarines
peaches
pears
plums
watermelon
Low FODMAP  fruits include:
unripe bananas
clementine
kiwi
limes
mandarins
oranges
papaya
passionfruit
pineapple
rhubarb
starfruit
All fruits contain the FODMAP fructose. However, some fruits have less fructose and can be enjoyed in single portions throughout the day.
Some vegetables are high in FODMAPs.
In fact, vegetables contain the most diverse range of FODMAPs. This includes fructans, GOS, fructose, mannitol, and sorbitol.
Furthermore, several vegetables contain  more than one type of FODMAP . For example, asparagus contains fructans and fructose.
It’s important to remember that vegetables are part of a nutritious diet, so there’s no need to stop eating them. Instead, simply switch out high FODMAP vegetables for low FODMAP ones.
High FODMAP  vegetables include:
asparagus
beets
Brussels sprouts
butternut squash
cauliflower
fennel
globe and Jerusalem artichokes
karela
leeks
mushrooms
snow peas
Low FODMAP  vegetables include:
arugula
bean sprouts
bok choy
cabbage
carrot
choy sum
collard greens
cucumber
daikon radish
eggplant
green bell pepper
jicama
kale
lettuce
okra
tomato (cooked or canned)
spinach
yam
Vegetables contain a diverse range of FODMAPs. However, many vegetables are naturally low in FODMAPs.
Legumes  and pulses are notorious for causing excess gas and bloating, which is partly attributed to their high FODMAP content.
The key FODMAP in legumes and pulses is called GOS.
The GOS content of legumes and pulses is affected by how they’re prepared. For instance, canned lentils contain half the GOS that boiled lentils do.
This is because GOS is water-soluble, meaning some of it leaches out of the lentils and into the liquid.
Nonetheless, even canned legumes are a significant source of FODMAPs, though small portions (typically 1/4 cup per serving) can be included in a low FODMAP diet.
Legumes and pulses are good sources of  protein  for vegetarians, but they are not the only choices. There are many other low FODMAP, protein-rich options.
High FODMAP  legumes and pulses include:
almonds
baked beans
black beans
black-eyed peas
broad beans
butter beans
cashews
chickpeas
fava beans
kidney beans
lentils
pinto beans
pistachios
soybeans
split peas
Low FODMAP , vegetarian sources of protein include:
tofu
tempeh
eggs
most nuts and seeds
Legumes and pulses are notorious for causing excess gas and bloating. This is related to their high FODMAP content, which can be altered by how they’re prepared.
Sweeteners can be a hidden source of FODMAPs, as adding sweeteners to a low FODMAP food can increase its overall FODMAP content.
To avoid these hidden sources, check the ingredients list on packaged foods.
Alternatively, if you’re in the U.K., the King’s College low FODMAP  app  allows you to scan the barcodes on packaged foods to detect high FODMAP foods.
High FODMAP  sweeteners include:
agave nectar
high fructose corn syrup
honey
malt extract
molasses
added polyols in sugar-free mints and chewing gums (check the labels for sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, or isomalt)
Low FODMAP  sweeteners include:
glucose
jaggery
maple syrup
sucrose
sugar
most  artificial sweeteners  like aspartame, saccharin, and stevia
High FODMAP sweeteners can increase a food’s FODMAP content. To avoid these hidden sources, check the ingredients list on packaged foods.
Wheat is not the only grain high in FODMAPs. In fact, other grains like rye contain nearly  twice the amount  of FODMAPs as wheat does.
That being said, some types of rye bread, such as sourdough rye bread, can be low in FODMAPs.
This is because the process of making sourdough involves a fermentation step, during which some of its FODMAPs are broken down into digestible sugars.
This step has been shown to  reduce its fructan content  by more than 70%.
This reinforces the notion that specific processing methods can alter the FODMAP content of food.
High FODMAP  grains include:
amaranth
barley
rye
Low FODMAP  grains include:
brown rice
buckwheat
maize
millet
oats
polenta
quinoa
tapioca
teff
Wheat is not the only high FODMAP grain. However, the FODMAP content of grains can be reduced through different processing methods.
Dairy products  are the main source of the FODMAP lactose.
However, not all dairy foods contain lactose.
This includes many hard and matured kinds of cheese, as much of their  lactose is lost  during the cheesemaking process.
But it’s important to remember that some cheeses contain added flavorings, such as garlic and onion, that make them high in FODMAPs.
High FODMAP  dairy foods include:
buttermilk
milk
quark (over 6.35 ounces)
ricotta (over 7.05 ounces)
paneer (over 7.76 ounces)
custard
kefir
yogurt
Low FODMAP  dairy foods include:
cheddar cheese
Swiss cheese
Parmesan cheese
feta cheese
sour cream
whipped cream
cream
ghee
lactose-free milk
Dairy is the main source of the FODMAP lactose, but a surprising number of dairy foods are naturally low in lactose.
Beverages are another key source of FODMAPs.
This is not exclusive to beverages made from high FODMAP ingredients. In fact, beverages made from low FODMAP ingredients can also be high in FODMAPs.
Orange juice is one example. While  oranges  are low FODMAP, many oranges are used to make one glass of orange juice, and their FODMAP content is additive.
Furthermore, some types of  tea  and  alcohol  are also high in FODMAPs.
It’s also important to consider that some nondairy  milks  are high in FODMAPs. Alternative milk options such as  oat  milk and soy milk are high in FODMAPs.
High FODMAP  beverages include :
apple juice
chai tea
chamomile tea
coconut water
fennel tea
kombucha
oat milk
orange juice
soy milk
dessert wine
rum
Low FODMAP  beverages include:
beer
black tea
coffee
gin
green tea
peppermint tea
rooibos tea
vodka
water
white tea
red wine
white wine
Many beverages are high in FODMAPs, and this is not limited to beverages made from high FODMAP ingredients.

Should everyone avoid FODMAPs?
Only a small subset of people in the general population should avoid FODMAPs.
In fact, FODMAPs offer health-promoting benefits for most people. Many FODMAPs function like  prebiotics , meaning they promote the growth of healthy bacteria in your gut.
Nonetheless, a surprising number of people are sensitive to FODMAPs, particularly those who have IBS.
Moreover, scientific studies have shown that around  70% of people  with IBS achieve adequate relief of their symptoms on a low FODMAP diet.
What’s more, pooled data from numerous studies suggest that the diet is effective at  managing abdominal pain ,  bloating , and diarrhea in people with IBS.
A low FODMAP diet is not intended to be a long-term avoidance diet.
Rather, it’s meant to be used as a  diagnostic tool  to identify which foods an individual can tolerate and which they can’t. This allows people to remove foods that trigger digestive symptoms while adding back in FODMAP foods that they can tolerate.
It should be noted that just because one type of FODMAP causes symptoms in an individual does not mean all FODMAPs will cause symptoms.
A low FODMAP diet with controlled reintroduction can help you determine which FODMAPs cause symptoms for you.
FODMAPs should only be restricted in a small subset of the population. For everyone else, FODMAPs should be readily included in the diet given their beneficial role in gut health.

Working with a dietitian
Following a low FODMAP diet can help relieve digestive symptoms in some individuals. However, the diet is very restrictive. It’s important to work toward getting all the nutrients you need.
If you think you may benefit from avoiding high FODMAP foods, consider working with an RD, if possible. They can explain the different phases of the low FODMAP diet and help you to implement it safely.
An RD can help ensure you’re eliminating all high FODMAP foods that could be causing symptoms, ensure you’re getting enough nutrients while on the low FODMAP diet, and assess which FODMAPs are cause symptoms. They can also help you wean off the diet when appropriate.
Studies suggest  a low FODMAP diet is most successful when implemented and managed in collaboration with an RD.

The bottom line
Many commonly consumed foods are high in FODMAPs, but they should only be restricted by people who are sensitive to them.
If you’re sensitive to FODMAPS, you should swap out high FODMAP foods for low FODMAP options from the same food group. This can help reduce your risk of nutritional deficiencies that can occur when following a restrictive diet.
