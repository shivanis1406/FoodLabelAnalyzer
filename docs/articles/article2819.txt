How do body fat scales work?
However, smart scales, as they’re sometimes called, are not foolproof.  Research  has found that while they accurately measure weight, the accuracy of body fat percentage may vary.
They aren’t recommended for children or pregnant people. If you want to use a body fat scale during  pregnancy , many scales have specific pregnancy features that disable the body composition measurement.
Further, BIA may affect  pacemakers . While some research shows that BIA is  safe  for people with pacemakers, it’s important to follow the directions for the specific device. If you have a pacemaker, talk with a healthcare professional before using a body fat scale.

What body fat scales measure

What should my body fat percentage be?
Healthy body fat percentages  depend on your sex and age :
A body fat level that falls above or below these ranges may negatively affect your health. If you’re unsure whether your current body fat level is within a healthy range, consider speaking with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian.
They can answer any questions you may have about body composition and help you set up appropriate testing to measure your body fat.

What to look for in a body fat scale
Which body fat scale is best for you will depend on the body composition metrics you want to measure.
Some of the most common measures are:
weight
body fat percentage
BMI
bone mass
muscle mass
body water percentage
estimated calorie needs
resting metabolic rate
If you’re interested in syncing your scale to your favorite health app, you might look for one that connects to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
Other key factors to consider are weight capacity, maximum number of users, and price.

Frequently asked questions
Sort of. Home  body fat scales  measure body weight accurately, but they may not accurately measure body fat percentage (BFP).
