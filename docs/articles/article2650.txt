Title: Eggs Are Some of the Most Cost-Efficient Protein Sources. Here Are 10 Easy Ways to Use Them

Studies show that eggs are inexpensive sources of protein and other important nutrients. Amid rising grocery costs across the U.S., eggs may be an excellent choice for many families. Here’s how to use them.
Eggs have been a staple in the human diet for thousands of years, and there are many good reasons why.
Compared with other types of animal proteins, eggs are affordable, lean, and abundant in healthy nutrients like vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and nutritious fats ( 1 ).
One study found that eggs are extremely cost-efficient protein sources — more so than red meat, poultry, and seafood ( 2 ).
They’re also some of the most cost-efficient sources of nutrients that many Americans lack, including choline, vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin E ( 2 ).
Some research has even observed that people who consume eggs regularly as part of a well-balanced diet tend to have a higher intake of vitamins and minerals compared with those who don’t eat eggs ( 3 ).
Another benefit of eggs is that they’re incredibly versatile. Sure, they’re often associated with breakfast, but there are many delicious ways to enjoy eggs all throughout the day.
Here are 10 of our favorite easy ways to use eggs.

1. In a frittata
A frittata is an Italian egg dish slow-cooked in a skillet on the stovetop or in the oven.
It’s similar in flavor and texture to a quiche, but since it doesn’t have a crust, it’s usually much quicker to put together.
Plus, you can throw in any veggies, meats, herbs, cheeses, or similar ingredients that you have on hand.
You can make also make bite-size frittatas using muffin tins that are super convenient and easy to take on-the-go — such as these  sun-dried tomato, rosemary, and goat cheese frittata muffins .

2. Scrambled in stir-fry
Stir-frying is a Chinese method of quickly sautéing cuts of meats and vegetables.
Not only is stir-fry often a one-pot meal, but because the ingredients are cooked only for a short period of time, the vegetables may retain more color and nutrients than they would when cooked longer.
An easy way to add extra protein to stir-fry is to include a couple of eggs in the dish.
Even if the recipe you’re following doesn’t call for eggs, you can still scramble a few on the side and then mix them into your final dish.
Or, try this  scrambled egg stir-fry  recipe that pairs eggs with shrimp, ginger, and green onions.

3. Poached in shakshuka
Shakshuka  is another one-pot meal of tomatoes simmered with onions, chilies, herbs, and spices and finished off with a handful of eggs poached directly in the tomato sauce itself.
A  popular Greek dish , shakshuka is a hearty meal that can be served at any time of day. It pairs wonderfully with a green salad and hot, crusty bread.
Not only does the meal deliver a serving of nutrient-dense lean protein from the eggs, but the stewed tomatoes are also rich in lycopene — a carotenoid known for its antioxidant properties that support optimal health ( 4 ).

4. Boiled on top of a salad
A simple salad makes for a great light breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and because there are so many ways to spice them up using different greens, grains, and toppings, it’s easy to keep salads feeling fresh and new.
One salad topper to consider is boiled eggs. Even adding just one boiled egg to your salad provides an extra 6 grams of protein ( 5 ).

5. Stuffed in a burrito
Wrapping scrambled eggs in a fresh  tortilla  is a great way to take your eggs with you when you’re in a rush.
Simply wrap your burrito in a paper towel or a piece of aluminum foil, and you’re ready to head out the door. You can also make a big batch of burritos in advance, freeze them, and reheat them as needed.
For added flavor, throw in some extra veggies, cheese, or your favorite salsa.
To increase the nutritional value of your burrito, consider using a whole-grain tortilla and limit processed meats like bacon and sausage. Instead, load up on your veggies with this  black bean egg burrito .

6. In a veggie hash
For veggie lovers, a quick  stovetop hash  can be enjoyed any time of the year.
Winter, spring, summer, or fall — there’s never a shortage of fresh veggies in season.
To round it out, crack an egg or two on top of your cooked veggies, cover the pan, wait a couple of minutes until the eggs are set, and then enjoy a meal that’s full of  complex carbohydrates , a lean protein, and healthy fats.

7. Added to savory oatmeal
Oatmeal and eggs are both quintessential breakfast foods, but chances are your first thought isn’t to combine them.
But that’s exactly what is done in many  savory oatmeal recipes .
Instead of relying on sweeteners for flavor, savory oatmeals usually incorporate ingredients like veggies and herbs.
To add eggs to savory oatmeal, simple place an egg prepared your favorite way right on top. Or, you can even mix a raw egg directly into your oatmeal as it cooks. Wait until it sets and you can no longer see any runny egg white or yolk.
More good news: oats are also considered a good source of low cost protein ( 6 ).
At Walmart, for example, a 32-ounce container of whole grain oats (about 30 1/2-cup servings) comes out to just under $4 USD — and each serving offers 5 grams of protein ( 7 ).

8. Mixed into egg salad
If you want to cook a big batch of eggs to stretch out over a couple of meals or days, consider egg salad.
Egg salad is made using boiled eggs and can be served on a sandwich, over greens, with crackers, or even plain.
Traditionally, egg salad is made using mayonnaise, but for a version that is lower in calories yet still creamy and delicious, try a  mayo-free egg salad  that uses  yogurt , avocado, or hummus in its place.

9. Baked in an avocado
Baked eggs in avocados are becoming more and more popular on brunch menus, but truthfully, they’re a cinch to make at home too.
To  bake your eggs in an avocado  at home:
Preheat the oven to 425 °F (220 °C).
Slice 1 avocado in half and remove the pit.
Crack open 2 eggs in a bowl — being careful not to break the yolks.
Arrange the avocado slices (flesh side-up) on a flat baking pan.
Slowly pour 1 raw egg into each of the avocado halves.
Sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper over each avocado half.
Bake the avocados for about 15 minutes or until the eggs are completely set.
You can liven up this dish with fresh herbs, a sprinkle of cheese,  green onions , roasted tomatoes, and more.

10. In a light carbonara
Pasta carbonara is another Italian classic. It’s made by slowly mixing raw eggs into cooked pasta to create a rich and creamy sauce.
Traditional versions of carbonara also tend to include cured meats and a liberal amount of grated cheese.
But you can  lighten up pasta carbonara  by using a whole grain pasta or leaving out the cured meat and instead replacing it with a fiber-rich green like spinach or kale.
