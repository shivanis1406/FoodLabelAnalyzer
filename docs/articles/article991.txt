Title: Potato Diet Review: Does It Work for Weight Loss?

The potato diet — or potato hack — is a short-term fad diet that promises rapid weight loss. However, its purported benefits are not supported by clinical research.

BOTTOM LINE: The potato diet lasts 3–5 days and only allows you to eat plain potatoes. It may help you lose weight but is extremely restrictive, lacks certain nutrients, and may lead to unhealthy eating behaviors.

What is the potato diet?
The concept dates back to 1849 but was made popular again by Tim Steele, who published “Potato Hack: Weight Loss Simplified” in 2016.
In his book, Steele suggests that potatoes are the “best diet pill ever invented.” He alleges they  strengthen your immune system ,  improve gut health , and provide plenty of nutrients to keep you energized while losing weight.
Others have taken the diet to new extremes — further boosting its popularity.
One example is Penn Jillette, a magician who published “Presto! How I Made Over 100 Pounds Disappear. ”  Jillette’s diet consisted of only plain potatoes for the first 2 weeks, during which he dropped 18 pounds (8 kgs).
Though many allege that the diet has helped them lose significant weight, no scientific studies support these claims.

What are the rules of the potato diet?
Tim Steele outlines seven fundamental rules in his book:
Eat only  plain potatoes  for 3–5 days.
Aim to eat 2–5 pounds (0.9–2.3 kg) of potatoes daily.
Avoid other foods, including condiments and toppings like ketchup, butter, sour cream, and cheese.
It’s okay to  use salt , but try to avoid it if possible.
Only drink water, plain tea, or black coffee.
Heavy exercise is not recommended. Instead, stick to light  exercise  and walking.
Take your usual medications as directed by your physician, but refrain from using unprescribed dietary supplements.
In Steele’s version of the diet, only  white potatoes  are allowed. Other variations of the diet are more lenient.
For example, sweet potatoes are permitted on the Spud Fit Challenge — a popular variation created by Andrew Taylor. In this version, minimal herbs, spices, and fat-free condiments are also allowed.
Keep in mind that the  cooking method  matters. Fried or overly processed potato products, such as traditional French fries or potato chips, aren’t on the menu.

Will the potato diet help with weight loss?
Studies on the potato diet specifically are unavailable, but it may help you lose weight simply because it’s very low in calories.
Research shows  that diets  restricting calories  likely lead to weight loss — as long as you can adhere to them.
Though 2–5 pounds (0.9–2.3 kgs) of potatoes daily seems like a lot, it amounts to only 530–1,300 calories. This is far less than the average adult’s recommended daily intake.
Interestingly, potatoes contain the compound proteinase inhibitor 2 (PI2), which may help decrease hunger by  slowing digestion .
One 2016 study  found that mice treated with this potato compound ate significantly less food and lost more weight than untreated mice. However, these effects have not yet been studied in humans.
The potato diet may be effective for short-term weight loss, but it’s not a long-term solution. Potatoes are nutritious but don’t contain all the nutrients you need for optimal health.
Furthermore,  very low calorie diets  have been  shown to  slow metabolism and decrease  muscle mass . You’ll likely regain any weight lost and  potentially more  when you return to your usual diet.

What are the potential benefits of the potato diet?
Though there are many reasons to criticize the potato diet, it does have some potential benefits:
Potatoes are highly nutritious.  Potatoes are an excellent  source of  essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C, potassium, folate, and iron.
It’s not complicated.  Though restrictive, the potato diet is fairly easy to comprehend. Simply eat plain potatoes for 3–5 days.
It’s affordable.  Potatoes are typically one of the cheapest types of fresh produce, making this diet  relatively inexpensive .
It’s high in fiber.   Studies show  that  high fiber diets  promote gut health and may play a role in preventing obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes.
Despite these benefits, potatoes don’t provide all the necessary nutrients — no single food can.
Following a  well-balanced diet  that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, and lean protein is better for your health and promotes  sustainable weight loss .

What are the potential risks or downsides to the potato diet?
There are significant downsides to relying on potatoes as your sole food source.
The potato diet may be one of the most restrictive diets out there. This makes it very difficult to follow. Even more concerning, this strict dieting may lead you to develop an  unhealthy relationship with food .
Restrictive dieting is a form of disordered eating that may lead to other unhealthy behaviors, such as  binge eating .
What’s more, other restrictive behaviors are encouraged on this diet — including skipping meals and fasting. This is highly unnecessary, as the diet is already very low in calories.
Shockingly, the author of “Potato Hack: Weight Loss Simplified” suggests that dieters should “learn to embrace the hunger and only give in if you must.”
Potatoes can undoubtedly be a nutritious component of an overall balanced diet. However, they cannot meet all your nutrient needs.
They lack two major nutrients —  protein  and fat. One medium-sized potato contains  about 4 grams  of protein and virtually no fat.
Though potatoes are high in certain vitamins and minerals — such as  potassium ,  vitamin C , and  iron  — they’re low in several others, including  calcium ,  vitamin A , and certain  B vitamins .
Since the potato diet is only intended to be followed for 3–5 days,  nutrient deficiency  is unlikely.
Still, you could put yourself at risk for several nutrient deficiencies if you choose to follow the diet long-term or in frequent bouts.
Fad diets like the potato diet are popular because they promise  rapid weight loss . However, muscle loss usually accompanies fat loss while dieting — especially when calories are drastically reduced.
For example,  one 2016 study  found that 18% of the weight lost by participants on a very low calorie diet with only 500 calories per day was from lean body mass.
In comparison, those on a low calorie diet with 1,250 calories per day only lost 8% of the weight from lean body mass.
Studies  show that  eating extra protein may help reduce muscle loss during calorie restriction, but the potato diet lacks a high quality protein source.
When following a very low calorie diet — such as the potato diet — your body  may adapt  by slowing down its metabolism and burning fewer calories.
Studies suggest  this slowdown may persist for many years, long after ending a calorie-restricted diet.
This is called “adaptive thermogenesis” and can make  maintaining weight loss  extremely difficult in the long term.
In fact, it’s a major reason why  researchers estimate  that over 80% of dieters return to their previous weight over time.

Foods to eat
Unless you’re participating in the Spud Fit Challenge or another more lenient diet variation, only plain white potatoes are permitted.
You might enjoy:
baked potatoes
boiled potatoes
steamed potatoes
raw potatoes
oven-baked, oil-free hash browns
oven-baked, oil-free home fries
oven-baked, oil-free French fries
Salt is the only seasoning permitted on the most basic version of the diet. However, other variations allow  spices  and fat-free condiments.
Additionally, some dieters use chicken or vegetable broth to make mashed potatoes or mash the potatoes plain.
For beverages, you’re advised to stick to water, plain tea, and black coffee

Foods to avoid
The list of foods to avoid on the potato diet is endless, as it restricts anything besides potatoes.
Certain types of potatoes, such as  sweet potatoes  and  yams , should also be avoided.
Potatoes fried in oil or overly processed are also off-limits. This includes traditional preparations of:
French fries
tater tots
potato chips

Sample menu
This sample meal plan uses 9–15 medium-sized potatoes per day. These may be boiled, steamed, baked, or eaten raw and provide roughly 780–1,300 calories daily.

The bottom line
On the potato diet, you eat only plain potatoes for 3–5 days. It’s claimed to aid weight loss, restore gut health, and boost immunity.
Though it may help you lose weight, it hasn’t been studied, is extremely restrictive, lacks certain nutrients, and may lead to  unhealthy eating behaviors .
The potato diet isn’t a good choice for healthy, sustainable weight loss.
