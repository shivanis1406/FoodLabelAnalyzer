Title: 5 Benefits and Uses of Micellar Water

Micellar water is a skin care product that can help hydrate and clean the skin, removing dirt and oil and helping keep your skin clear. It’s also suitable for people with sensitive skin.
Micellar water is a multipurpose skin care product that has become a favorite among beauty gurus and dermatologists alike.
It’s made using purified water, moisturizers like glycerin, and mild surfactants, which are compounds used for cleansing.
The molecules of these mild surfactants join to form micelles, a type of spherical chemical structure that helps pull dirt and oil from the skin ( 2 ).
Micellar water is not only gentle but also highly effective at removing dirt, makeup, and oil to help clear out your pores while toning the skin.
Plus, it’s free of alcohol and may help promote skin hydration while reducing irritation and inflammation, keeping your skin soft, supple, and smooth ( 1 ).
Here are 5 benefits and uses of micellar water.

1. Promotes skin hydration
Most types of micellar water feature hydrating compounds like glycerin, which has been shown to help the skin retain moisture more effectively.
In one study, applying  glycerin  to irritated skin was effective at restoring skin hydration and enhancing the skin’s natural barrier function ( 3 ).
Another review reported that glycerin may help speed wound healing, protect against irritation, and improve hydration when applied topically ( 4 ).
What’s more, the surfactants in micellar water are very mild and less irritating, making it a great choice for those with dry skin ( 5 ).
Micellar water contains glycerin, which can help support skin hydration. It also contains surfactants that are very mild and less irritating for those with dry skin.

2. Removes dirt and oil
Micellar water is typically used as a  facial cleanser  to help remove makeup, dirt, and oil from the skin.
This is due to the presence of micelles, which are compounds that are highly effective at removing dirt and oil to keep skin clear.
Micelles can also increase your skin’s permeability, allowing cleansers to reach deeper layers of the skin ( 6 ).
Glycerin has been shown to increase skin permeability as well, which can enhance the effectiveness of the cleansing compounds in micellar water ( 7 ).
Micellar water is often used to remove makeup, dirt, and oil from the skin. Several of its ingredients can increase skin permeability, allowing for a deeper cleanse.

3. Good for all skin types
Micellar water is incredibly versatile and well suited for just about any  skin type , regardless of whether you have dry, oily, or normal skin.
It’s especially beneficial for those with sensitive skin or conditions like  rosacea , as it’s free from ingredients that can be irritating to the skin, such as soaps and alcohols ( 8 ).
Glycerin, one of the main compounds in micellar water, has also been shown to reduce inflammation and irritation of the skin.
For example, one study showed that applying glycerin topically reduced skin irritation and decreased several markers of inflammation in mice ( 9 ).
Micellar water can be used on any skin type. It may be especially beneficial for those with sensitive skin, as it can help reduce skin inflammation and irritation.

4. Keeps skin clear
Micellar water could help keep skin clear, especially for those with  acne , blocked pores, or stubborn blemishes.
Conditions like acne are often caused by clogged pores, which can become inflamed and turn into pimples ( 10 ).
Although research on the effects of micellar water itself is limited, several studies have found that using a mild face wash can help improve acne and reduce blackheads ( 11 ,  12 ,  13 ).
What’s more, micellar water can be applied using just a cotton pad, which eliminates the need for facial brushes and washcloths that can spread germs and bacteria.
Micellar water can help remove dirt and oil, which may help prevent blocked pores and pimples to keep skin clear.

5. Portable and convenient
In addition to all the benefits associated with micellar water, this powerful product is portable, convenient, and easy to use.
Because it acts as a  makeup remover , cleanser, and toner, it eliminates the need for several other skin care products, which can free up space and reduce clutter in your cabinet.
It’s also great for traveling and can be useful in situations in which you may not have access to running water.
Smaller sizes are also available for when you’re on the go or running low on space.
Micellar water can replace several other products in your skin care routine, and it’s portable, easy to use, and convenient.

Potential side effects
Although micellar water is often advertised as a multipurpose product, that may not be the case for everyone.
For instance, while it can remove some makeup, you may also need to use a makeup wipe or facial cleanser to completely remove heavy or waterproof makeup.
Failure to remove eye makeup properly can contribute to a condition called Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD), which is characterized by symptoms like eye discomfort,  dryness , and pain ( 14 ).
Furthermore, those with certain skin conditions may require additional skin care products to address their specific needs ( 15 ).
If you have any skin care concerns, it’s best to consult a trusted healthcare professional to find a routine that works for you.
Although micellar water is often advertised as a multipurpose product, additional products may be necessary in some cases. If you have any skin care concerns, be sure to talk to a trusted healthcare professional.
