Title: Skullcap: Benefits, Side Effects, and Dosage

Skullcap is a flowering plant long used in traditional medicine. Supplements may provide health benefits, including improved mood, reduced inflammation, and anticancer effects. However, research continues on possible side effects.
Skullcap (sometimes spelled scullcap) is the common name for Scutellaria, a genus of flowering plants in the mint family.
Practitioners in traditional Chinese and Native American medicine use various parts of skullcaps, such as their roots and leaves to treat a variety of ailments, ranging from diarrhea to chronic pain.
Today, this plant is widely available in supplement form and is meant to provide various health benefits, from boosting heart health to relieving anxiety.
This article tells you everything you need to know about skullcap, including its uses, potential health benefits, and side effects.

What is skullcap and how is it used?
The name skullcap refers to any plant in the Scutellaria family, though American and Chinese varieties are most commonly used in natural medicine.
American skullcap (Scutellaria lateriflora) is a perennial (flourishing throughout the year) herb native to North America.
The leaves of American skullcap have been used in traditional herbal medicine. They have an  association with  calming properties, which practitioners often use to ease  anxiety  or epileptic  convulsions .
However, modern research is limited to in vitro studies without evidence of treating specific conditions.
Chinese skullcap (Scutellaria baicalensis) is native to several Asian countries, as well as Russia.
The dried roots of this plant have been used for centuries as a traditional Chinese medicine known as Huang Qin  to treat :
diarrhea
insomnia
dysentery
high blood pressure
hemorrhaging
respiratory infections
inflammation
In Asia, Huang Qin is used in  herbal remedies , such as Xiao Chai Hu Tang or Sho-saiko-to (SST), a popular formulation used  to treat  conditions like  fever , gastrointestinal issues, and  liver disease .
Both American and Chinese skullcap are available as supplements that can be purchased online or in health food stores. Other varieties, such as Scutellaria barbata, are also used in alternative medicine and have been studied for their potential health benefits.
Skullcap is sold in capsules, powders, and liquid extracts. Dried parts of the plant, such as its leaves, are likewise used to brew tea.
American and Chinese skullcap are flowering plants commonly used in natural medicine to treat a variety of conditions, including insomnia, inflammation, and diarrhea.

Potential benefits of skullcap
Supplementing with skullcap may provide several benefits, though research in most of these areas is limited.
American skullcap has been shown to boost mood and reduce symptoms of  anxiety .
A small, older  2013 study  of 43 people found that those who received 1,050 mg of American skullcap daily for 2 weeks reported significant enhancements in mood compared to a placebo group.
It’s thought that American skullcap positively impacts mood and  reduces anxiety  by stimulating  gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) , a neurotransmitter that helps calm nerves.
Notably, this plant was used in traditional medicine practices as a  sedative  and treatment for conditions like  insomnia  and anxiety.
In fact, many anti-anxiety medications work similarly  by increasing  GABA activity.
Scutellaria (S.) barbata, also known as barbat skullcap is another species with medicinal properties.  Studies indicate  that it has powerful antiviral and antibacterial effects.
One  test-tube study  found that barbat skullcap could potentially help prevent  COVID-19  infection by blocking key proteins the virus uses to infect cells.
Another older  study  sampled over 30 Chinese herbs and found that only S. barbata extract showed 100% antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter baumannii (XDRAB), a bacterium that is a leading cause of pneumonia in people who need to get hospitalized.
Furthermore, this extract showed better antibacterial effects than colistin, an antibiotic.
The same study demonstrated that S. barbata was also effective in reducing XDRAB bacterial load in the lungs of mice, compared to a control group.
Both American and Chinese skullcaps contain an array of beneficial plant compounds, including  antioxidants , which have anti-inflammatory effects and protect your cells from damage caused by free radical molecules.
Oxidative stress , which results from an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants, is  linked to  a number of chronic conditions, such as certain cancers and heart disease.
Notably, baicalin, a flavonoid antioxidant in both American and Chinese skullcap, has demonstrated powerful anticancer effects and may help combat oxidative stress.
For example, in test-tube studies, baicalin has been shown to slow down tumor growth, causing cancer cells to die, and affecting important cell signals in the body.  Research  indicates its effectiveness against several types of cancer, including cervical, breast, stomach, bladder, prostate, and lung cancers.
However, it’s important to note that these results are preliminary, and further research is required to determine whether baicalin has similar effects in humans.
Scutellarein is another American skullcap compound that exhibits potent  anticancer potential  in test-tube studies.
Additionally, some  test tube studies  reveal that wogonin, a flavonoid compound in Chinese and American skullcap, is particularly effective in treating inflammatory conditions like psoriasis.
It’s worth noting that Chinese and American skullcap contain many other anti-inflammatory compounds. In fact,  more than 40  flavonoids have been isolated from the Chinese species alone.
Skullcap has been linked to several other benefits, including:
Anticonvulsant effects:  Orally supplementing with American skullcap has  been shown  to have anticonvulsant effects in rodents.
Insomnia:  Baicalin, a compound found in both American and Chinese skullcap, is used to treat  insomnia  in traditional medicine practices. However, more  research  is needed.
Neurodegenerative disease:  Some test-tube studies suggest that American skullcap  may have  neuroprotective properties, potentially safeguarding against diseases like  Alzheimer’s  and  Parkinson’s .
Heart health:  In  one animal study , baicalin injections significantly reduced damage linked to an induced  heart attack .
Although these effects are promising, more research is needed to determine whether skullcap is an effective treatment for these conditions.
Several types of skullcap, including American and Chinese varieties, are linked to many health benefits, ranging from reduced inflammation to improved mood. However, more human studies are needed.

Skullcap precautions
Although supplementing with skullcap may provide health benefits, it may not be appropriate for everyone and may cause serious side effects in certain cases.
For example, American and Chinese skullcap is  associated with  liver damage and even  liver failure  in some people. That said, these outcomes mostly involved supplements containing multiple herbs, not just skullcap.
Even so, people with conditions that affect liver function should avoid this plant completely.
Chinese skullcap has also been  associated with  lung complications and can interact with many common medications, such as:
blood thinners
cholesterol-lowering medications
cytochrome P450 substrate drugs
Other types, including the American variety, may cause side effects.
Additionally, due to a lack of enough safety information, practitioners do not recommend it for use by children or pregnant or breastfeeding people.
Some supplements have been  shown to contain  adulterants, which can reduce their quality and effectiveness. Others may harbor ingredients not listed on the label.
As with any supplement, use caution when buying skullcap. Rely on trusted companies certified by a third party or independent laboratory.
While different forms have been used since ancient times to treat a variety of ailments, human studies on their safety and effectiveness are lacking. Always consult your doctor before taking any herbal supplement, including skullcap.
Skullcap may lead to serious side effects, such as liver damage, and should not be given to children or taken by people on certain medications, as well as pregnant or breastfeeding women.

Skullcap dosage
There is no standard dosage of skullcap. It may depend on the type and form of this herb, so it’s best to check individual supplements for more information.
Teas made of skullcap, sometimes blended with other herbs like  lemon balm , are also available in health food stores and online. They may not have the same effects as supplements because tea is typically less concentrated.
Tinctures  containing skullcap and other potentially calming herbs, such as  valerian root , are available as well. The dosage for tinctures depends on concentration and ingredients.

The bottom line
Skullcap is a flowering plant long used in traditional medicine.
Supplementing with skullcap may provide several health benefits, such as improved mood, reduced inflammation, and anticancer effects.
However, human research on skullcap is lacking, and this supplement may cause several adverse side effects.
For this reason, it’s best to consult your doctor if you’re interested in taking any form of skullcap.
