Uses of chia seeds and hemp seeds
Both chia seeds and hemp seeds have a mild, nutty flavor and can be used interchangeably in many different dishes.
For instance, both make great additions to smoothies,  oatmeal ,  yogurts , or salads to bump up the flavor, as well as the fat and fiber content.
However, unlike hemp seeds, chia seeds can absorb up to 15 times their dry weight in water, forming a soft, gel-like texture ( 5 ).
For this reason, chia seeds are often used to thicken puddings, soups, spreads, jams, and sauces. They can also be used as a binder in place of eggs to make vegan baked goods, including cookies or quick breads.
Conversely, hemp seeds retain their crisp texture when combined with liquid and can be used to add an extra crunch to brownies, muffins, or veggie burgers.
Hemp seed oil  is also widely available and is often applied topically, used in place of other cooking oils, or mixed into drinks or salad dressings.

Health benefits of chia seeds and hemp seeds
Chia seeds and hemp seeds have both been associated with several health benefits, thanks to the stellar nutrient profiles of each.
In fact, both are rich in antioxidants, which are beneficial compounds that can reduce inflammation and protect against chronic disease ( 6 ,  7 ,  8 ).
Both seeds are also great sources of  omega-3 fatty acids , which are heart-healthy fats with powerful anti-inflammatory effects ( 3 ,  4 ).
Furthermore, both seeds provide hearty doses of protein in each serving. Protein is necessary for immune function, tissue repair, and muscle growth ( 9 ).
However, while both are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and protein, hemp seeds contain a higher amount in each serving ( 1 ,  2 ).

Increasing your intake of fiber very quickly can increase the risk of digestive issues, such as  bloating , gas, and stomach pain ( 12 ,  13 ).
Furthermore, because chia seeds can absorb large amounts of liquid and expand in size, they could increase the risk of choking in people who have difficulty swallowing ( 14 ).
