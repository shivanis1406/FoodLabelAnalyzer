Title: 17 Healthy Lunch Ideas for Weight Loss

Eating balanced meals can be a challenge, but including certain ingredients can aid weight loss and have other health benefits. Try these 17 recipes for your next nutritious lunch option.
Having a nutritious lunch isn’t always easy, especially if you’re busy at work or on the go during the day. That’s why it’s important to have a list of go-to lunch ideas on hand.
This way, you can stay prepared and avoid skipping meals or relying on fast food and other less nutritious options.

1 to 5. Plant-based lunches for weight loss
Plant-based diets  like  vegan or vegetarian diets  have been  associated with weight loss  in some people.
Lentils  provide filling protein, carbs, and fiber, while the  veggies  contribute additional fiber, too. In fact, 1 cup of cooked lentils provides about  16 grams  of fiber.
Plus, lentils are a  good source of iron , an important nutrient for blood health that some plant-based eaters may  lack in their diets .
This  lentil soup recipe  is a complete meal in one bowl. It’s loaded with ingredients that are good to eat when you’re trying to lose weight.
Some research suggests that chickpeas  aid weight management , likely due to the vitamins, minerals, fiber, and protein they contain, among other beneficial nutrients.
The texture of  chickpeas  makes them very easy to smash with a fork to create a chickpea “salad” filling for sandwiches — the perfect lunch food.
This recipe for  garden veggie chickpea salad sandwiches  is a delicious lunch option if you’re trying to lose weight and eat a plant-based diet. If you follow a vegan diet, swap out the mayo for a vegan substitute.
Tofu  is a soy-based  complete protein , meaning it contains all the  essential amino acids  humans need from food.
It’s also a source of isoflavones, which are compounds that research involving Korean  premenopausal  women found may  protect against heart disease .
Try these  tofu Buddha bowls  for lunch. They’re made with crispy tofu,  brown rice , veggies, and a spicy peanut dressing.
Choose whole wheat wraps (or use lettuce), and add a protein source, a healthy sauce or spread, and plenty of vegetables to ensure that your veggie wraps are filling and delicious and will help you lose weight.
This  veggie wrap recipe  uses whole wheat tortillas,  hummus ,  carrots ,  cucumbers , and other veggies.
The  edamame  and hummus provide protein, while the avocado contributes  healthy fats  that help you feel full.
Sweet potatoes  provide energizing carbs,  plenty of fiber , and the pigment  beta carotene , which can help you meet your needs for vitamin A to help  support your immune system .
This  recipe for stuffed sweet potatoes  uses Southwest seasonings and offers tips for vegan topping alternatives if needed.
Bake the sweet potatoes and prep the filling in advance, then store them in containers in the fridge. Assemble the potatoes and reheat them when you’re ready to eat.

6 to 10. Low carb lunches for weight loss
Some  research  backs the potential role of low carb eating to help you lose weight, suggesting that limiting your  carb intake  may improve your  blood sugar regulation  and promote weight loss.
That said, these diets may also lead to weight gain when discontinued.
Using  cauliflower  instead of regular rice not only lowers the carb content of the meal but also provides a ton of vitamin C. This water-soluble nutrient is  important for :
skin health
wound healing
immune health
Follow this  recipe for cauliflower rice bowls  for a low carb version of a burrito bowl.
Tuna and eggs are  high protein foods  that will keep you full long after lunch.
In fact, eating  eggs  instead of a higher carb meal may help reduce hunger and the number of calories you consume later in the day, which can help  promote weight loss .
While egg and tuna salads are usually served on bread, you can stuff them into  bell peppers  for a low carb meal instead.
Check out this easy recipe for  tuna egg salad stuffed bell peppers .
This  zucchini noodle stir-fry  is a delicious lunch option that uses  zucchini  noodles, or “zoodles,” that resemble regular noodles but are lower in carbs.
The  zucchini  packs fiber and  micronutrients , and the chicken contributes protein to this dish.
Chicken is an excellent lean protein to eat when you’re trying to lose weight. In fact, eating  chicken  and a  vegetable-rich  diet is linked to a reduced risk of developing obesity.
Eating more non-starchy, low calorie, and high fiber vegetables like  eggplant  often helps people lose weight.
Using  eggplant  in place of pizza crust is a great way to enjoy the flavors of pizza without consuming too many  refined carbs  at lunch.
If you work from home or have little time for lunch meal prep, give this easy recipe for  low carb eggplant pizza  a try. The recipe provides options to add more protein if you’d like.
This  Mediterranean-inspired Cobb salad  is heavy on veggies and uses a homemade yogurt dressing instead of mayo-based dressing or store-bought ranch.
Many of the ingredients offer health benefits.  Eggs  are rich in protein and antioxidant compounds that  promote eye health , while  avocados  and  tomatoes  contribute a boost of heart-healthy nutrients like  unsaturated fats  and  lycopene .

11 to 13. Diabetes-friendly lunches for weight loss
If you have  obesity  and  diabetes , a healthcare professional may advise you to lose weight to improve or help manage your condition.
Eating a balanced  diet high in protein  and maintaining a weight that’s healthy for you are both important for good  blood sugar regulation .
A diabetes-friendly lunch resembles a balanced plate, containing fiber from  non-starchy vegetables  and:
complex carbs
protein
healthy fat
Pairing carbs with these other  macronutrients  is  key to preventing  your blood sugar from  spiking , helping maintain good blood sugar, and restoring energy levels throughout the day.
Avocado toast on  whole grain bread  can be a great base for this type of lunch.
This  diabetes-friendly version  features protein-packed  cottage cheese  and fresh tomatoes to complete the meal.
Though  quinoa  is technically a pseudocereal, it’s often grouped with whole grains since it’s nutritionally similar and has a high fiber content.
It’s also a  source  of protein, vitamins, and minerals, making it a good food to add to meals if you have obesity and for blood sugar management.
This quinoa salad  gets additional protein from chicken, includes tons of non-starchy veggies, and has plenty of flavor from lemon juice and parsley.
Black beans  are a  high fiber , high protein food. Eating them can help people with diabetes who are trying to lose weight.
They’re also a good source of  folate , a B vitamin that’s necessary for  healthy blood cells  and fetal development.
This black bean soup recipe  uses veggies, canned black beans, and lots of seasonings.

14 to 17. Paleo lunches for weight loss
The  paleo diet  may be useful for weight loss and have other beneficial effects on health, such as  reducing blood pressure  in those with  type 2 diabetes .
If you love the taste of takeout egg rolls, you can easily mimic the flavors by making a deconstructed version for lunch.
Egg  roll bowls can be made with filling and lean protein like ground turkey or chicken. They’re also usually loaded with  cabbage , a rich  source of vitamin K .
Vitamin K  is a fat-soluble nutrient that’s essential for  proper blood clotting .
This  egg roll in a bowl recipe  is a healthier twist on a takeout favorite and is suitable for those following a paleo diet and wanting to lose weight.
Pair meatballs with fresh vegetables and a tasty sauce for a balanced meal. The meatballs will provide filling protein and  vitamin B12 , an important nutrient for the nervous system, while veggies contribute fiber.
But it’s important to keep an eye on the added sugar content of your sauce, as many sauces are often laden with  hidden added sugar s, which can  promote weight gain .
Try to choose a sauce free of added sugars or make your own from scratch to limit empty calories.
Check out this paleo-friendly recipe for  Greek meatballs with tzatziki sauce  to make for lunch.
Chicken curry is made with various seasonings that may provide health benefits. For example,  turmeric  has anti-inflammatory compounds that help  protect against disease development .
A paleo version of chicken curry made with cauliflower rice instead of white rice is a healthy lunch option for weight loss.
This chicken curry recipe  is suitable for a paleo diet and features flavorful spices and filling ingredients like coconut milk and veggies.
This easy recipe for  hearty hamburger soup  combines pantry staples, ground beef, and seasonings into one delicious meal.
The recipe also calls for tomatoes and tomato paste.  Tomatoes  are a  source of potassium , a mineral involved in healthy  blood pressure regulation , so eating them may help  boost heart health .
