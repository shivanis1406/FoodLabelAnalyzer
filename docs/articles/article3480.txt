Probiotics have been found to support health in various ways, including benefits for gut health, immune support, weight loss, and more. For men, probiotics may also benefit urinary and prostate health and fertility.
While a probiotic formulated specifically for men may not be needed to derive most benefits, these products sometimes contain nutrients and other substances known to support men’s health.

Sex and gender exist on spectrums. This article uses the term “men” to refer to a person’s sex assigned at birth.

Our picks of the best probiotics for men

Best for men over 50
Number of servings   30 per container
Dose   3 capsules per day
CFU count   85 billion
Shelf-stable   no
*Price may vary.
For men looking for an all-in-one supplement that contains vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and other health-promoting substances, Garden of Life RAW Men is an excellent option.
This product contains 85 billion colony-forming units (CFU) of a blend of probiotic strains, including  Lactobacillus  species, which is one of the  dominant species  in your gastrointestinal tract, and probiotic yeasts .
In addition to the probiotic blend, Garden of Life RAW Men contains a variety of vitamins and minerals that are essential to men’s health, including vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin D, selenium, and iodine. Men older than 50 years are much more likely than younger men to develop low levels of  B12  and  vitamin D , both of which can negatively affect health. Adding a multinutrient supplement to your routine could help fill in dietary gaps and support healthy nutrient levels.
However, to prevent overconsumption of some nutrients, such as vitamin E, this probiotic may not be suitable for  men already taking a multivitamin . Vitamin E has been  linked  to an increased risk of prostate cancer, according to updated data the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) researchers published.
Garden of Life guarantees the CFU through the end of the product’s “best use” date, which indicates a higher quality product.

Best for digestive health

Culturelle, which has one of our favorite  women’s probiotics , also makes the once-daily Men’s Daily Health probiotic and multivitamin supplement.
We like that this product provides 10 billion CFUs of  Lactobacillus rhamnosus  GG , a probiotic strain that has been shown to be particularly helpful for those with digestive conditions. Additionally, it contains at least 100% of the recommended daily allowance of vitamins C, D3, B6,  B12 , magnesium, and selenium, a vitamin and mineral combination that may eliminate the need to take an additional multivitamin.
For men with digestive conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic constipation, or diarrhea, taking a high quality probiotic supplement may be a smart choice. Studies have shown that probiotic supplements may significantly  improve  IBS symptoms, such as bloating and abdominal pain, and may help improve bowel issues like constipation and diarrhea.
Culturelle also guarantees that the number of CFUs in their products is viable through the expiration date. Because they’re live organisms, probiotics are vulnerable to factors like storage time and temperature changes. For this reason, the  NIH recommends  that customers choose probiotic products that guarantee the CFU count is viable at the end of the product’s shelf life and not at the time of manufacture, which helps ensure you’re buying a quality product.

Taking certain probiotics may help improve the health of the urinary tract and prostate. Hyperbiotics Pro-Men is a product that’s clinically proven to reduce bacterial load in urine, which could be helpful for men who experience frequent urinary infections.
The  2021 study  previously mentioned that involved 20 men ages 55–65 years with recurrent urinary infections found that those who supplemented with Hyperbiotics Pro-Men daily for 12 weeks had reductions in the bacterial load of  E. coli  and  E. faecalis , bacteria that commonly cause urinary infections, in their urine cultures compared with a placebo group.
Research also indicates  that taking probiotics may help reduce inflammation, which could be helpful for men with prostatitis or inflammation of the prostate. Plus, Hyperbiotics Pro-Men contains curcumin, a powerful anti-inflammatory polyphenol that’s been shown to be helpful for  inflammatory disorders  like prostatitis.
Every ingredient used in Hyperbiotics products is third-party tested, and the company guarantees that Pro-Men contains at least 1.5 billion viable CFUs at the date of expiration.

Jarrow Formulas Jarro-Dophilus EPS contains eight probiotic strains, including some shown to help support a moderate body weight, such as  Bifidobacterium longum . Studies show that supplementation with probiotics containing various bacterial strains, including bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, may help support reductions in body fat, waist circumference, and BMI. What’s more, findings from a  2019 research review  suggest that taking probiotic supplements could also be effective for improving certain metabolic health markers, such as blood sugar and insulin resistance.
Researchers think that taking a high quality probiotic supplement like Jarro-Dophilus EPS may help  support  weight loss and metabolic health by decreasing inflammation, influencing appetite, improving insulin sensitivity, and more.
Jarro-Dophilus EPS capsules are enterically coated, which can help  minimize capsule breakdown  in the stomach to increase probiotic delivery to the intestinal tract. Jarrow also guarantees the CFU count through the “best used before” date.

Comparing the best probiotics for men

How we chose the best probiotics for men
We selected the best probiotic supplements for men using the following criteria:
Vetting:  All the products have been vetted to ensure that they meet Healthline’s medical and business standards, adhere to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations on allowable health claims and labeling requirements, and are manufactured in facilities that adhere to Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) the FDA established.
Quality and safety:  We prioritized products from companies that follow strict safety and quality standards. Most products on this list are third-party tested.
Effective dose:  All the supplements above contain at least 106 (1 million) CFUs per gram.
Price:  We included a range of products at different price points so you can find one that works for your budget.
Men’s needs:  We included products that contained probiotic strains and other ingredients that specifically benefit men’s health.
Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the products on this page, we considered all the probiotics that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further.

How probiotics may benefit men
Certain probiotics may help improve the health of the urinary tract and prostate. A  2021 study  involved 20 men ages 55–65 with recurrent urinary infections but otherwise healthy. Research indicated that those who supplemented with probiotics for 12 weeks had a reduced bacterial load of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Escherichia faecalis (E. faecalis) in their urine cultures compared to a placebo group. These two bacteria strains commonly cause urinary infections.
Studies also show  that taking probiotics may help reduce inflammation, which could be helpful for men with prostatitis, or inflammation of the prostate.
Probiotics may also benefit male fertility. In one study, probiotic supplementation led to a significant  increase  in sperm concentration and motility. But more research is needed on the role that probiotics may play in male fertility.

What to look for in a men’s probiotic
If you’re interested in taking a probiotic supplement, it’s important to choose safe, high quality products that provide effective strains in evidence-based doses.
If your intent is to improve a specific aspect of health or symptoms of a medical condition like IBS, it’s best to work with a healthcare professional to choose a probiotic best suited for your needs. This is because certain probiotic strains and doses are  more effective  for certain symptoms and medical conditions than others.
Choose a probiotic that guarantees that the number of CFUs in their products is viable through the expiration date, so you can be sure you’re purchasing an effective product.
However, while probiotics may be  beneficial  for certain conditions, they’re not necessary or appropriate for everyone. In fact, they may be most helpful for those who do not eat many  probiotic foods . More  research  is needed on the potential benefits of probiotic supplements in healthy adults.
If you experience  side effects  that are severe or don’t improve after several days, it’s recommended to stop using the product and consult a healthcare professional.
Taking probiotics can be a good way to support your digestive health. There is evidence that these supplements can reduce inflammation in the gut and support prostate health.

There is not enough evidence to suggest that taking probiotics can increase levels of testosterone that are lost when men age.
A  recent study  found that high- or low-dose probiotics had no effect on testosterone levels in men aged 50 to 65. However, triglyceride levels significantly decreased.

There is no evidence that men need different strains of probiotics than women. However, many companies who offer probiotics for men include multivitamins specific to men’s needs.

Takeaway
Probiotic supplements may benefit men’s health in a number of ways, from improving symptoms of common digestive conditions to supporting prostate health and fertility.
Though probiotics are not appropriate for everyone, some men can benefit from taking a high quality probiotic supplement specific to their health needs and goals.
If you’re concerned about urinary health, digestive health, or metabolic health, you may want to consider talking with your healthcare professional about whether adding a probiotic supplement to your wellness routine a suitable option.
