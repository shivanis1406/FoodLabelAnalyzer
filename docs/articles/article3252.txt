Title: 7 Drinks That May Help You Sleep

Certain drinks may promote better sleep by calming the mind and body. Herbal teas like chamomile and valerian root, as well as warm milk are popular choices known for their relaxing properties.
A good night’s rest is often overlooked as an important component of health. Experts recommend that adults aged 18–60 get at least 7–9 hours of sleep each night. Too little or too much sleep is associated with an increased risk of depression, diabetes, heart disease, and even death.
Unfortunately, sleeping for at least 7 full hours each night does not always come easy. There are a variety of sleep-inducing drinks that include properties that may help you catch some z’s. Here are 7 drinks that you can try.

1. Chamomile tea
Chamomile is a daisy-like flower that is part of the  Asteraceae  family.
Tea made from this plant has been consumed for ages. It has multiple health benefits, including relieving cold symptoms, reducing inflammation, and improving skin health.
A  2024 review  concluded that chamomile did improve sleep, especially the number of awakenings after sleep or staying asleep. Drinking chamomile tea did not result in an improvement in the duration of sleep, percentage of sleep efficiency, or daytime functioning.
To make chamomile tea at home, add 4 tablespoons of fresh (or 2 tablespoons of dried) chamomile flowers to 1 cup (237 ml) of boiling water. Let the flowers steep for about 5 minutes before using a mesh strainer to drain the liquid from the flowers.

2. Ashwagandha tea
Ashwagandha has a reputation for being a powerful medicinal plant. It’s sometimes called Indian ginseng or winter cherry.  Ashwagandha  is traditionally used in Ayurvedic practices.
More research is needed, but a  2021 study  found that found that ashwagandha extract had a small but significant effect on improving sleep compared with taking a placebo.
You can buy ashwagandha tea bags at most grocery or health food stores.
Another way to drink ashwagandha is in moon milk.  Moon milk  is a traditional Ayurvedic remedy for insomnia made by adding ashwagandha, cardamom, cinnamon, and nutmeg to warm milk.

3. Valerian tea
Valerian  is a perennial plant that blooms sweet-smelling pink or white flowers and is part of the honeysuckle family.
Similarly to ashwagandha, the root of the valerian plant is used as a medicinal herb that’s known to promote sleep and  relieve insomnia .
A  2020 review  that included 60 studies concluded that valerian could be a safe and effective treatment to promote sleep and prevent associated disorders.
To make valerian root tea, steep 2–3 grams of dried valerian root in 1 cup (237 ml) of hot water. Let it sit for 10–15 minutes before straining.

4. Peppermint tea
Formally known as the  Lamiaceae , the herbs of the mint family are well known for their culinary uses. This includes peppermint, which appears to be powerful and versatile in its uses.
Peppermint has been used in traditional medicine for years. The tea is believed to have antiviral, antimicrobial, and even anti-allergenic properties. Peppermint  may also help  with gastrointestinal (GI) conditions like indigestion and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
Peppermint tea is easy to make. Simply boil 2 cups (480 ml) of water and add a handful of peppermint leaves. You can adjust the quantity of leaves depending on how strong you like your tea. Let the leaves sit in the hot water for at least 5 minutes.

5. Warm milk
It may sound like an old wives’ tale, but many reputable organizations recommended  warm milk  for a  good night’s sleep .
That’s because milk contains tryptophan. Tryptophan naturally  increases serotonin , a neurotransmitter known for happiness and well-being. Plus, serotonin is a precursor to the sleep-regulating hormone melatonin.
Simply put, tryptophan increases serotonin levels, which increases melatonin levels. Melatonin may  promote sleep  and help combat various sleep disorders, including jet lag, shift work sleep disorder, and insomnia.
It’s possible that having a glass of warm milk before bed is simply a soothing ritual that helps you unwind and prepare to rest. If you want to give warm milk a try, simply choose your favorite milk and bring it to a low simmer on the stove for a couple of minutes.
Unless you’re lactose intolerant or have a milk allergy, there’s no harm to giving this bedtime ritual a shot.

6. Almond milk
Almonds are tree nuts packed with healthy fiber, vitamins, and minerals.  Almond milk  is a creamy, nutty alternative to cow’s milk that is made by blending almonds with water and then straining the pulp.
Almond milk is high in sleep-promoting hormones and minerals, including tryptophan,  melatonin , and magnesium. In fact, 1 cup (237 ml) of almond milk contains nearly 17 mg of magnesium.
In recent years,  magnesium  has shown potential as a treatment for insomnia, particularly in older adults.
Almond milk can likely be found at your local grocery store. It comes in a variety of brands and flavors. You can also make it at home.
Given that almond milk is made from whole almonds, people with nut allergies should avoid almond milk and products made with it.

7. Banana-almond smoothie
Bananas  are another food that’s  high  in magnesium, tryptophan, and melatonin.
By combining bananas and almond milk in a smoothie, you can combine tryptophan and melatonin to possibly help reduce symptoms of insomnia.
To make a banana-almond smoothie, blend:
1 fresh or frozen banana
1 cup (237 ml) of almond milk
1 tablespoon (15 grams) of almond butter
1/2 cup of ice (if using fresh a banana)
This simple recipe makes a good smoothie base to which you can add other ingredients that are rich in magnesium and  potassium , such as leafy greens, orange juice, dark chocolate, yogurt, or avocados.
As long as you don’t have an allergy to bananas or almonds, a smoothie like this is a healthy and delicious way to end the day.

The bottom line
Sometimes  good sleep  can be easily interrupted or hard to come by.
Fortunately, many beverages can serve as natural sleep aids.
Some sleep-promoting drinks are high in compounds like tryptophan and melatonin, while others encourage sleep by easing pain and discomfort in the evenings.
Most drinks with sleep-promoting potential can be prepared with just a few simple ingredients in 5 minutes or less.
Consider trying a few of the drinks above to find out which ones help you sleep best.
If you continue to have trouble sleeping, speak with your healthcare provider to get to the bottom of what may be causing your sleep difficulties.
