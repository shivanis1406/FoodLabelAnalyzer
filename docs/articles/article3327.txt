Title: 16 Superfoods That Are Worthy of the Title

Good health is best supported by eating a variety of nutritious foods every day. Including some or all of the foods on this list as part of a balanced diet can help your overall health and even prevent certain chronic diseases.
Nutritionally speaking, there is no such thing as a superfood.
The term was coined for marketing purposes to influence food trends and sell products.
The food industry bestows the superfood label on nutrient-rich foods with a supposed capacity to positively affect health.
Though many foods could be described as super, it’s important to understand that there is no single food that holds the key to good health or disease prevention.
But since the term “superfood” doesn’t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon, it may be worth taking a closer look at some healthy options.
Here are 16 foods that may be worthy of the esteemed superfood title.

1. Dark Leafy Greens
Dark  green leafy vegetables  (DGLVs) are an excellent source of nutrients including folate, zinc, calcium, iron, magnesium, vitamin C and fiber.
Part of what makes DGLVs so super is their potential to reduce your risk of chronic illnesses including heart disease and type 2 diabetes ( 1 ,  2 ).
They also contain high levels of anti-inflammatory compounds known as carotenoids, which may protect against certain types of cancer ( 3 ).
Some well-known DGLVs include:
Kale
Swiss chard
Collard greens
Turnip greens
Spinach
Some DGLVs have a bitter taste and not everyone enjoys them plain. You can get creative by including them in your favorite soups, salads, smoothies, stir-fries and curries.
Dark green leafy vegetables are full of fiber and nutrients which may be instrumental in preventing certain chronic diseases.

2. Berries
Berries  are a nutritional powerhouse of vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants.
The strong antioxidant capacity of berries is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease, cancer and other inflammatory conditions ( 4 ,  5 ).
Berries may also be effective in treating various digestive and immune-related disorders when used alongside traditional medical therapies ( 6 ).
Some of the  most common  berries include:
Raspberries
Strawberries
Blueberries
Blackberries
Cranberries
Whether you enjoy them as part of your breakfast, as a dessert, on a salad or in a smoothie, the health benefits of berries are as versatile as their culinary applications.
Berries are full of nutrients and antioxidants which may prevent certain diseases and improve digestion.

3. Green Tea
Originally from China,  green tea  is a lightly caffeinated beverage with a wide array of medicinal properties.
Green tea is rich in antioxidants and polyphenolic compounds which have strong anti-inflammatory effects. One of the most prevalent antioxidants in green tea is the catechin epigallocatechin gallate, or EGCG.
EGCG is likely what gives green tea its apparent ability to protect against chronic diseases including heart disease, diabetes and cancer ( 7 ,  8 ).
Research also indicates that the combination of catechins and caffeine in green tea may make it an effective  tool for weight loss  in some people ( 9 ).
Green tea is antioxidant-rich with many health benefits including possible cancer prevention.

Fermented, probiotic-rich foods like kefir have several associated health benefits, including reduced cholesterol, lowered blood pressure, improved digestion and anti-inflammatory effects ( 21 ,  22 ,  23 ).
Though kefir is traditionally made from cow’s milk, it’s typically well tolerated by people with  lactose intolerance  due to the fermentation of the lactose by bacteria.
However, it’s also made from non-dairy beverages such as coconut milk, rice milk and coconut water.
You can purchase kefir or make it yourself. If you’re choosing a commercially prepared product, be mindful of added sugar.
Kefir is a fermented dairy beverage with multiple health benefits related to its probiotic content. Though generally made from cow’s milk, kefir is also available in non-dairy forms.
