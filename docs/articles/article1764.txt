What is krill oil?
Krill are microscopic crustaceans that live in the ocean, and most krill oil is harvested from Atlantic krill.
The oil is a great alternative to fish oil, providing all the same benefits. It’s rich in omega-3 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and may be able to deliver these health-boosting omega-3s more efficiently than fish oil ( 1 ).
Krill also contains astaxanthin, an antioxidant pigment that gives the oil its dark red color.
In addition to helping fight oxidative stress, astaxanthin may offer benefits for heart health, inflammation, skin protection and repair, and treatment of age-related diseases ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ).

The benefits of krill oil
The benefits of EPA, DHA, and astaxanthin-rich krill oil include decreasing inflammation, improving blood lipid levels, and optimizing brain function. The oil may also play key roles in arthritis management and treatment of symptoms associated with premenstrual syndrome ( 1 ).
One study found that a moderate daily krill oil supplement offered therapeutic benefits in people with dry eye disease, compared with a placebo. The authors attributed the benefit to the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in krill oil ( 5 ).
Krill oil may also offer more effective omega-3 delivery than other marine oils when used to improve brain inflammation and thinking ability in the context of high fat diets  ( 6 ).
This advanced omega-3 absorption, plus the astaxanthin in krill oil, may be promising for addressing age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease ( 6 ).
Some research also suggests that krill oil supplementation can help lower levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides, two blood fats that can negatively impact heart health when levels are too high ( 7 ).
Additionally, in a more recent animal study, krill oil helped slow the progression and spread of cancer cells in mice. The researchers noted that krill oil or its components may have therapeutic potential in treating colorectal cancer ( 8 ).
Krill oil may also be a more sustainable alternative to fish oil, as it’s estimated that there are 300–500 million tons of krill in the Atlantic at any given time — and only a small fraction of that amount is harvested ( 1 ).

How we chose the best krill oil supplements
In this article, we selected the top krill oil supplements based on the following criteria ( 9 ):
Third-party testing.  Has the supplement been third-party tested for purity, safety, and/or quality? Some reputable third-party supplement testing organizations include NSF International, United States Pharmacopeia (USP), Informed Sport, and ConsumerLab.  International Krill Oil Standards (IKOS)  is the only third-party testing and certification program exclusively for krill oils. The product will generally bear a seal indicating its investment in a third-party testing process.
Omega-3 content.  Does it contain at least 250 mg of combined EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids? Does it also contain phospholipids to help increase omega-3 bioavailability?
Quality of ingredients.  Does it contain additional oils, fillers, or additives?
Vetting.  All the products included have been vetted to ensure that they meet Healthline’s medical and business standards.
Brand reputation.  Is the brand established and well known in the supplement industry? Does it have generally positive reviews for its products, ingredients, and customer service?

It bears an MSC Certified Sustainable Seafood seal, meaning that it comes from a fishery that has been third-party verified to meet the MSC’s standard for a well-managed and sustainable fishery. The fishery is also certified by Friend of the Sea and the  Sustainable Fisheries Partnership . You can actually trace your bottle back to the exact spot in Antartica where the krill oil was harvested.
They also partner with various organizations: the Antarctic Wildlife Research Fund (AWF), the Association of Responsible Krill Harvesting Companies (ARK), and the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).

Safety and side effects
Krill oil is considered a relatively safe supplement for most people, similar to fish oil.
However, this doesn’t mean that taking more is better. Some people may experience digestive symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, or bloating when taking krill oil. Others have reported mood swings, tiredness, and increased hunger ( 15 ).
High doses of krill oil may also potentially interact with the blood clotting process in your body, though the research on this is not consistent.
For instance, some studies have found that using fish oil or krill oil with warfarin (a common blood-thinning medication) does not significantly affect blood clotting when the individual is using the medication under medical supervision ( 16 ).
Still, it’s always best to consult a healthcare professional before adding krill oil to your routine, especially if you’re taking a medication such as a blood-thinning agent.

How to choose a krill oil supplement
The most important consideration in choosing a krill oil supplement is whether it has undergone third-party testing.
Supplements are not regulated as strictly as pharmaceuticals, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) typically doesn’t get involved until after there is a problem.
Third-party testing is a voluntary service that a supplement company must pay for, but it ensures that the supplement contains what the label claims it does.
All the products on this list indicate that they have undergone third-party testing to some degree. For further information, you can often find certificates of analysis on the brands’ websites.
The best supplement companies will also disclose which third-party organizations conducted the testing and allow you to view the reports on their websites.
IKOS is a common third-party testing organization for krill and is the only one specifically for krill oil. Other reputable seals to look for are NSF International, USP, Informed Sport, and ConsumerLab, although these don’t appear on krill oil supplements as often as IKOS does.
Additionally, you should look for a krill oil supplement that contains  at least 250 mg of combined EPA and DHA omega-3s per serving , as most of the health benefits of krill oil are derived from its omega-3 fatty acid content.
These supplements should also contain phospholipids to help your body effectively use omega-3s.
That said, it’s important to note that the products in this article vary in capsule size and concentration of omega-3s.
Finally, you should choose one that’s free of fillers or extra ingredients. Most products on this list contain only the ingredients needed to make the softgel capsule and a flavor extract to improve the taste.

Frequently asked questions
Not everyone experiences side effects when taking krill oil. However, krill oil supplements may cause digestive symptoms like nausea, diarrhea, or bloating for some people. Others have reported changes in mood, increased hunger, and increased tiredness after taking them.
It’s best to speak with a healthcare professional before adding a krill oil supplement to your routine ( 15 ).
Krill oil supplements may offer potential benefits for heart, skin, joint, and brain health. Most benefits of krill oil are thought to come from the antioxidant astaxanthin as well as the omega-3 fatty acids the oil contains ( 1 ,  6 ,  7 ).
The recommended amount of krill oil to take is generally based on the EPA and DHA omega-3 content per serving. Aim for a minimum of 250–500 mg of combined EPA and DHA omega-3s per serving, though there is no standard recommendation ( 17 ).

The bottom line
Krill oil is a promising alternative to fish oil that’s just as rich in omega-3 fatty acids, more sustainable, and potentially more efficient at delivering omega-3s to your body.
It may be beneficial for heart health, brain health, and inflammation ( 1 ).
The best  krill oil supplements  are those that have undergone third-party lab testing, contain at least 250 mg of combined EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids per serving, and are free of unnecessary ingredients or fillers.
Look for krill oil supplements that also contain a higher amount of phospholipids (such as 400 mg per serving), as this helps enhance your cells’ omega-3 absorption ( 13 ).
