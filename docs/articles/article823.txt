Vitamin D helps you maintain strong bones and muscles. But deficiencies are common among older adults, those with darker skin tones, people with liver or kidney disease, and folks following restrictive diets.
If you’re at risk of vitamin D deficiency or are worried about your levels, an at-home test may be a good first step. Here, we explain how the hydroxy-25 vitamin D test works, who should use it, and recommend the best options.

What is the hydroxy-25 vitamin D test?
The most accurate measurement of your vitamin D levels is a  25-hydroxy vitamin D test . It measures your blood level of 25-OH vitamin D, or the  form of D  that is converted and used by your body.
Done through a blood draw in a doctor’s office or via a finger prick blood sample at part of an at-home kit, this test can determine whether your vitamin D levels are too high, too low, or adequate.
This test is also known by other names, including 25(OH) D, calcidiol, or cholecalciferol test. It can be an important indicator of  vitamin D  deficiency, which can lead to  osteoporosis  (bone weakness) and  rickets  (bone malformation).
The 25(OH)D test is particularly useful for individuals at risk of a deficiency, such as those with limited sun exposure, people who eat a  vegan diet , or people with medical conditions that make it difficult for the body to absorb nutrients from food or to convert vitamin D into a usable form.

At-home vitamin D tests compared

How we chose the best at-home vitamin D tests
We considered the following factors when determining which products should make our list:
Company reputation:  We selected tests that reputable companies offered. Furthermore, our  internal vetting  team thoroughly vetted each company based on its business practices.
Lab certification:  All the tests below are processed in  Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified  facilities to ensure compliance with safety and quality standards.
Test methodology:  During vetting, Healthline’s medical experts reviewed the methodology behind each test to ensure it’s based on sound science.

Who should take a vitamin D test?
A vitamin D test might be beneficial for:
people who don’t get regular sun exposure
those at risk for vitamin D deficiency
people with dairy allergies or those who follow restrictive diets
individuals who have low levels of other important nutrients, like  magnesium  (which plays a crucial role in vitamin D activation in the body)
those with  symptoms of a vitamin D deficiency
people taking vitamin D supplements to check whether their vitamin D levels are improving
People who may be at a higher risk of deficiency include:
older adults
those with darker skin tones
those who have undergone  bariatric surgery
people following restrictive diets
people with certain conditions, including obesity,  Crohn’s disease , and chronic liver or kidney disease
Research suggests that it’s best to wait at least  3 months  before retesting to see if your vitamin D levels have changed after starting your treatment plan, which can help avoid unnecessary stress and medical expenses.
If you’re concerned about your vitamin D or are at high risk for a deficiency, testing vitamin D  twice a year  — in the spring and again in the fall — can alert you of any changes.

How to choose an at-home vitamin D test
If you and your healthcare professional have determined that you would benefit from an at-home vitamin D test, there are some factors you’ll want to consider as you choose:
Time:  How fast do you need your results? What is the expected turnaround time from this company?
Cost:  How much does this test cost compared to your insurance copay at a lab? Do you have FSA/HSA funds you could use?
Support:  Will you be able to talk about your results with a qualified medical professional? It can be stressful to get lab results with no interpretation.
Accreditation:  Does this company work with a reputable lab, preferably accredited by laboratory accreditation agencies?

How can I increase my vitamin D levels?
You can increase your vitamin D levels by:
spending time in the sun  (you need about 10 to 15 minutes a day in the sun without sun protection on 40% of your body)
eating foods containing vitamin D
taking  supplements containing vitamin D

When to speak with a doctor
To learn more about your test results:  If you have test results and you’d like to understand them better, it’s a good time to reach out to a healthcare professional. They can help you interpret the results and determine the next steps.
To discuss symptoms that may be affecting your daily life:  If you’re experiencing symptoms like constant or increased tiredness, hair loss, slow wound healing, or chronic pain, it’s a good idea to contact a health professional. They can check your vitamin D levels with a blood test and help you rule out other causes of your symptoms.
If changes to boost vitamin D haven’t seemed to help:  If spending more time in the sun and increasing your dietary intake of vitamin D haven’t improved how you’re feeling, it’s worth talking with a healthcare professional.

The bottom line
Vitamin D is an important micronutrient because it plays a large role in bone and immune system health. Many people with vitamin D deficiency don’t experience any symptoms. So, testing your vitamin D levels may help provide information about your health.
An at-home test is a convenient way to monitor your vitamin D levels. Note that there isn’t much research available on the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency.
Before purchasing a test, it’s important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine whether testing is needed and, if so, how often. A healthcare professional can also recommend any at-home testing options and advise you on your results and treatment for a vitamin D deficiency.
