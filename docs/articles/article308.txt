Title: The 13 Best Foods to Increase Blood Flow and Circulation

Several foods have been shown to help improve blood flow and support heart health, including garlic, onions, beets, berries, citrus fruits, and leafy greens, among others.
Poor circulation is a common problem caused by a number of conditions.
Peripheral artery disease  (PAD), diabetes, obesity, smoking, and Raynaud’s disease are some of the many  causes of poor circulation.
Reduced blood flow can cause unpleasant symptoms, such as pain, muscle cramps, numbness, digestive issues, and coldness in the hands or feet.
In addition to those with  poor circulation , athletes and active individuals  may want to increase  blood flow in order to improve exercise performance and recovery.
Although circulatory issues are often treated with medications, eating certain foods can also improve blood flow.
Here are the 13 best foods to optimize blood flow.

1. Cayenne pepper
Cayenne pepper  gets its spicy flavor from a phytochemical called capsaicin.
Capsaicin  promotes blood flow  to tissues by lowering blood pressure and stimulating the release of  nitric oxide  and other vasodilators — or compounds that help expand your blood vessels.
In fact, spicy peppers are  frequently included  in pain-relieving creams because ingesting them helps increases circulation, improves blood vessel strength, and reduces  plaque buildup  in your arteries.

2. Pomegranate
Pomegranates are juicy, sweet fruits that are  particularly high  in polyphenol  antioxidants  and nitrates, which are potent vasodilators.
Consuming  pomegranate  — as a juice, raw fruit, or supplement — may improve blood flow and oxygenation of muscle tissue, which could especially aid active individuals.
For example, a  2016 study  found that daily consumption of 17 ounces (oz.), or 500 milliliters (mL), of pomegranate juice during or before weight training reduced soreness, muscle damage, and inflammation in elite weightlifters.

3. Onions
Onions  are an  excellent source  of flavonoid antioxidants, which benefit  heart health  by helping your arteries and veins widen when blood flow increases.
Onions also have anti-inflammatory properties, which can boost blood flow and heart health by  reducing inflammation  in veins and arteries.

4. Cinnamon
Cinnamon is a warming spice that has many  health benefits  — including increased blood flow.
In a  2021 study , researchers found that between two groups of subjects with a similar health profile, the group that consumed cinnamon had a statistically significant reduction in blood pressure after 90 days compared to the placebo group. That said, this decrease was moderate.
Another  2021 meta-analysis of eight studies  found that cinnamon has a more favorable effect on diastolic blood pressure than on  systolic blood pressure.

5. Garlic
Garlic is well known for its beneficial impact on circulation and heart health.
Studies suggest that  garlic  — specifically, its sulfur compounds, which include allicin —  can increase  tissue blood flow and lower blood pressure by relaxing your blood vessels.
In fact, in a study of 42 people with coronary artery disease, those who consumed garlic powder tablets containing 1,200 mg of allicin twice daily for 3 months experienced a  50% improvement  in blood flow through the upper arm artery compared to a placebo group.

6. Fatty fish
Fatty fish like  salmon  and mackerel are  excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids .
These fats are especially beneficial for circulation because they  promote  the release of nitric oxide, which dilates your blood vessels and increases blood flow.
Omega-3 fats  also  help inhibit  the clumping of platelets in your blood, a process that can lead to blood clot formation.
What’s more, a  2022 study  found that taking at least 2-3 grams a day (g/d) of omega-3 fatty acids helps reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Higher doses may help people with a higher chance of getting heart problems even more.

7. Beets
Many athletes supplement with beet juice or beet powder to help improve performance.
This is because  beets  are high in nitrates, which your body converts into nitric oxide. Nitric oxide  relaxes  blood vessels and increases blood flow to muscle tissue.
This means beets may help improve blood flow. In a  2017 study  of 12 older adults, those who drank 5 oz. (140 mL) of nitrate-rich beet juice per day experienced significant decreases in blood pressure, clotting time, and blood vessel inflammation than those who consumed a placebo.

8. Turmeric
Increased blood flow is one of  turmeric’s many health benefits.
In fact, both Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicine have utilized turmeric since ancient times to open blood vessels and  improve  blood circulation, particularly due to a compound found in turmeric called  curcumin .
In a 2017 study of 39 people, taking 2,000 mg of curcumin daily for 12 weeks led to a  37% increase  in forearm blood flow and a 36% increase in upper arm blood flow.

9. Leafy greens
Leafy greens  like spinach and collard greens  are high in nitrates , which your body converts into nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator.
Research  has observed that people following a traditional Japanese diet high in nitrate-rich vegetables like Chinese cabbage and spinach have lower blood pressure than those who consume a diet low in vegetables.

10. Citrus fruits
Citrus fruits like oranges, lemons, and  grapefruit  are packed with antioxidants, including flavonoids.
Consuming flavonoid-rich citrus fruits  may help reduce  blood pressure and stiffness in your arteries while improving blood flow and nitric oxide production.
Additional  research from 2022  also found that eating  citrus fruits  like oranges is associated with reduced blood pressure.

11. Tomatoes
Tomatoes  may help  reduce  the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which causes blood vessels to constrict to control blood pressure.
Test tube research  suggests that tomato extract works similarly to ACE-inhibiting drugs, by opening up your blood vessels and improving blood flow.

12. Berries
Berries  are especially healthy, as they have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory qualities, which  may have  a positive impact on blood flow.
Research  shows that  eating berries  can lower blood pressure, heart rate, platelet aggregation, and blood levels of inflammatory markers like interleukin-6 (IL-6) while also improving artery dilation.

13. Ginger
Ginger is a staple in traditional medicine in India and China for thousands of years. In both human and animal studies, ginger  has been shown  to reduce high blood pressure, which negatively impacts blood flow ( 54 ).
In a  2017 study  of 4,628 people, those who consumed the most ginger — 2–4 g per day — had the lowest risk of developing high blood pressure.

How do you increase blood flow naturally?
While incorporating any of these foods into your diet may improve circulation, other lifestyle changes may have a larger impact.
Here are some other  lifestyle modifications that can optimize blood flow:
Quit smoking:  Smoking is a risk factor for many chronic diseases — such as cancer — and can negatively impact circulation.
Increase physical activity:  Exercise stimulates blood flow and helps improve vasodilation. Plus, regular  exercise  decreases your risk of heart disease.
Reach or maintain a moderate weight:  Being overweight or having obesity negatively impacts blood flow and can lead to dangerous complications, such as plaque buildup in your arteries.
Follow a healthy diet:  Instead of simply stocking up on particular foods, try switching to a diet rich in healthy, whole foods — such as vegetables,  healthy fats , and fiber-rich foods — which can improve circulation and support heart health.
Reduce stress:  Research proves that stress levels can significantly impact blood pressure.  Manage your stress  through yoga, meditation, gardening, or spending time in nature.

Frequently asked questions
Drinking fluids in general is important for good blood flow. Dehydration can decrease your blood volume, which means that blood may not be able to reach all your vital organs.
Learn more about  dehydration and blood flow.
Bananas  contain potassium , which is important for healthy blood pressure. This benefit is most prominent if you eat bananas raw, rather than consuming them as part of baked goods for example.

The bottom line
There are many natural ways to improve circulation, including choosing foods that stimulate blood flow.
The antioxidants, nitrates, vitamins, and other substances contained in the foods above can have a positive impact on your circulation.
What’s more, leading a healthy lifestyle by abstaining from smoking, staying active,  maintaining a moderate weight , and eating a  well-rounded diet  can boost blood flow and overall health.
