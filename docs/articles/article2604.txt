Title: Chickpeas vs. Garbanzo Beans: What’s the Difference?

Beans and legumes are pantry staples with an array of culinary uses and health benefits.
Of the multiple types of legumes, chickpeas are one of the more popular varieties. In the United States, both “chickpeas” and “garbanzo beans” can be found on grocery store shelves ( 1 ).
But are chickpeas the same as garbanzo beans? This article will explain the difference between chickpeas and garbanzo beans and discuss ways to use these delicious legumes.

Is there a difference between chickpeas and garbanzo beans?
In short, no. There isn’t a difference between  chickpeas  and garbanzo beans.
However, understanding the varieties of chickpeas helps to explain the addition of the term “garbanzo bean.”
Chickpeas are a type of  legume , the family of plants that also includes peanuts, soybeans, lentils, and peas. Legumes have edible seeds that grow in pods.
Within the legume family are two categories: oilseed and non-oilseed legumes. The non-oilseed legumes include a sub-category called “pulses,” and chickpeas fall into that sub-category ( 2 ).
Chickpeas are a type of pulse and can further be split into two main types:  desi  and  kabuli  ( 3 ).
The  desi  chickpea is a smaller seed with a thick outer coating that must be removed before eating. These types of chickpeas have multiple color varieties, including brown, black, green, and yellow ( 4 ).
Kabuli  chickpeas are larger, have a thin outer coating, and are lighter in color.
The  desi  and  kabuli  chickpea types are the most prevalent on store shelves, but there are multiple wild chickpea relatives currently being studied for crop diversity purposes ( 5 ).
When buying chickpeas in your local grocery store, it’s most likely that you’ll purchase a  desi  or  kabuli  chickpea variety.
In the United States,  kabuli  chickpeas are often labeled as garbanzo beans. However, the name difference is not indicative of a functional difference in the plant.
All garbanzo beans are considered to be chickpeas. However, it’s most common that those labeled as “garbanzo beans” are the  kabuli  variety of chickpea.
Chickpeas and garbanzo beans are interchangeable names that refer to the same variety of the chickpea known as the  kabuli  chickpea.

Common culinary uses for chickpeas
Chickpeas are a versatile ingredient with a variety of culinary uses. Their culinary application and nutrient composition — including that fact that they’re a great source of protein and fiber — makes them ideal for use in recipes as a  plant-based protein .
Chickpeas are common in Mediterranean,  South Asian , and Middle Eastern recipes, such as hummus, falafel, and some curry dishes ( 1 ,  6 ).
Non-traditional culinary uses for chickpeas have become increasingly popular, too. Some food manufacturers turn to chickpeas as a gluten-free flour substitute and, in some cases, as an egg substitute (made from the liquid of canned chickpeas) ( 7 ,  8 ).
For the home cook, chickpeas are a pantry staple that are available in both dried and canned preparations. This legume can be eaten boiled or roasted and can also be ground into a flour for use in recipes.
Canned chickpeas  can be found in both regular and low sodium varieties and typically require minimal prep before use.
Unlike canned chickpeas, the dried variety requires additional planning and preparation. You’ll need to soak them in water, drain them, and heat them to cook until soft.
However, dried chickpeas may be a good choice if you need to limit your sodium intake because canned beans often contain extra salt.
Chickpea flour  is also available for home cooks for use in baked products as a gluten-free flour substitute.
It’s the base for many gluten-free  chickpea pastas  and can add a boost of fiber and protein to recipes compared with traditional flours.
Chickpeas can be used in multiple recipes, including:
soups, chili, stews
bean-based burgers
vegetarian meatballs
hummus and other dips
baked goods like brownies and cookies
