Title: Are Carrots Good for Your Eyes?

Though the idea that carrots are good for your eyesight stemmed from a myth, carrots contain many beneficial nutrients that may support healthy eyes and many other health benefits.
It’s commonly said that carrots keep your eyes healthy and improve  night vision . However, you may wonder about the origin of this idea and whether it’s supported by science.
This article tells you whether carrots benefit your eyes and provides other tips to keep your vision healthy.

Carrots and eye health
It has long been believed that eating carrots  promotes eye health  and improves your eyesight, especially at night.
Though there is truth to this, the association between carrots and eyesight originated from a myth.
During World War II, British Royal Air Force pilots first began using radar to target and shoot down enemy planes. To keep this new technology a secret, the visual accuracy of the pilots — especially at night — was attributed to eating carrots.
This led to a longstanding propaganda campaign that promoted carrots for better eyesight and embellished a link between eating carrots and improved night vision, which remains today.
Although they’re not quite the magic eye food they were marketed to be during World War II, carrots contain certain compounds that are good for your eyes.
Carrots are a rich source of beta-carotene and lutein, which are antioxidants that can help prevent eye damage caused by  free radicals .
When their numbers become too high, free radicals are compounds that can  lead to :
cellular damage
aging
chronic illnesses, including eye diseases
Beta-carotene gives many red, orange, and yellow plants their coloring. Orange carrots are especially high in beta-carotene, which your body converts into vitamin A.  Deficiency in vitamin A  has been  linked  to  vision loss .
Vitamin A is needed to form rhodopsin, the reddish-purple, light-sensitive pigment in your eye cells that help you  see at night .
Your body absorbs and utilizes beta-carotene more efficiently when you eat cooked carrots rather than raw ones. Furthermore, vitamin A and its precursors are  fat-soluble , so eating carrots with a fat source  improves absorption .
Yellow carrots contain the most lutein, which may help prevent age-related  macular degeneration  (AMD), a condition in which vision gradually blurs or disappears. Diets rich in lutein may be especially  protective against AMD .
Carrots are a good source of lutein and beta-carotene, which are antioxidants that benefit eye health and protect against age-related degenerative eye diseases. Your body converts beta-carotene into vitamin A, a nutrient that helps you see in the dark.

Other health benefits of carrots
Carrots support healthy eyes, but there are many other reasons to eat them.
Other health benefits of carrots include:
Support digestive health:  Carrots are high in fiber, which helps prevent  constipation . One baby carrot contains  2.7 grams of fiber , or 8% of the daily value (DV). Fiber  supports  a healthy gut.
May reduce cancer risk:  Fiber-rich foods like carrots may help protect against  colon cancer  by promoting digestive regularity. A greater consumption of  dietary fiber  is associated with a  reduced risk  for colorectal cancer.
Stabilize blood sugar:  Carrots have a  low glycemic index (GI) , meaning that they may not cause a large  spike in blood sugar  when you eat them. Their fiber content also helps  stabilize blood sugar  levels.
Good for your heart:  Red and orange carrots are  high in lycopene , a heart-protective antioxidant. In-vivo (living organism-based) and in-vitro (performed outside of living organisms) tests have revealed that carrots may also help  regulate blood sugar levels , promote heart health, and  reduce cholesterol  levels.
Protect your skin:  Though not as effective as  sunscreen , beta-carotene and lycopene antioxidants may help  protect your skin  from sun damage.
May support weight loss:  Carrots are low in calories and high in fiber. Eating high fiber foods increases feelings of satiety, or fullness, which may  prevent overeating  and aid  weight loss .
Aside from their contributions to eye health, there are many reasons to eat carrots. They can benefit your digestive system, as well as heart, skin, and overall health.

Other ways to boost your eye health
Eating carrots isn’t the only way to keep your eyes healthy and your vision sharp. Other strategies to improve your eye health include the following:
Use sun protection:  Choose sunglasses that protect your eyes from 99% to 100% of UVA and UVB rays. Sun damage can  lead to eye disease , cataracts, and macular degeneration.
Limit screen time and blue light:  Extended television, phone, or computer time can cause eyestrain. At night, turn off screens or turn on the night-light filter on your phone, as  blue light  can  cause retinal damage .
Self-managing diabetes:  Diabetes frequently causes diabetic retinopathy (DR).  Studies  have found a link between DR and the risk factors hyperglycemia and hypertension. Talk with your doctor about possible medications to manage these risk factors, setting up regular DR screenings to monitor progression and other treatments.
Avoid smoking, or try a smoking cessation program:  Cigarette and e-cigarette use has been  linked to ocular discomfort , pain, burning, itching, redness, dryness, glare,  blurriness , eyestrain, and headaches in adolescents.
Strive for a balanced diet:  Other nutrients can also  benefit your eye health . EPA and DHA omega-3 fats (e.g., fatty fish, flax), vitamin C (e.g,  citrus fruits ,  broccoli ), vitamin E (e.g.,  nut butters ), and  zinc  (e.g., meat, oysters, and  pumpkin seeds ) are good for your eyes.
Eat dark leafy green vegetables:  Kale,  spinach , and  collard greens  are high in the  carotenoids   lutein and zeaxanthin , which  support eye health .
Get regular eye exams:  The best way to know how your eyes are doing is to have them regularly examined by an eye care professional. Seeing an  optometrist or ophthalmologist  is a good  preventive health  habit to get into.
Eating a nutritious diet, exercising, limiting screen time, avoiding smoking or trying a smoking cessation program, wearing sunglasses, and having your vision checked regularly by an eye doctor are important habits for optimal eye health.

The takeaway
The idea that carrots promote healthy eyes and good vision originates from a myth — but that doesn’t mean it’s untrue.
They’re especially high in the antioxidants lutein and beta-carotene, which have been shown to protect your eyes.
Carrots may also benefit your digestion, heart, skin, and overall health.
If you want to keep your eyes healthy, you should also establish other healthy, vision-protective habits, such as exercising, wearing sunglasses, limiting screen time,  eating a balanced diet , and avoiding smoking or trying a  smoking cessation  program.
