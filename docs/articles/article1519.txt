Title: Is sassafras tea safe?

Medical professionals do not recommend consuming sassafras tea. This is because sassafras oil is extremely toxic to humans. Some of this toxicity may be present in sassafras tea.
Sassafras is a tree that’s native to certain parts of North America and Eastern Asia. It has smooth bark and fragrant leaves.
However, sassafras traditionally includes safrole, which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned. Research findings into the benefits of sassafras also remain limited.
This article examines the potential risks of sassafras tea, as well as what some of the research says.

Potential side effects or risks of sassafras tea
Sassafras can be dangerous to consume. It contains safrole, a compound that  has been banned by the FDA  for use in human food due to its potentially toxic effects.
According to the  National Toxicology Program’s Report on Carcinogens , multiple studies in mice show that safrole may induce  liver cancer  and tumor growth.
Although research in humans is lacking, the organization has classified safrole as “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen” based on the results of these animal studies.
It’s best to avoid drinking sassafras tea. If you drink sassafras and you experience any symptoms, discontinue use immediately and seek immediate medical advice.

Possible health benefits of sassafras tea
The possible health benefits of sassafras tea don’t outweigh the possible risks. You should not take sassafras tea to treat any medical condition or improve your general well-being.
There is also currently very limited research into any of the benefits of sassafras tea. Research on the anti-inflammatory effects of sassafras tea is limited. The  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  points out that there is no scientific research to support the use of sassafras to treat inflammation.
In the  1700s , physician Joseph Jakob Plenck created a list of plants that offered diuretic properties. The list included sassafras. However, it’s important to note that this study used a concentrated amount of a compound isolated from sassafras.
Specific compounds in sassafras may help treat  leishmaniasis . A  2015 test-tube study  found that sassafras bark extract had anti-leishmaniasis activity against promastigotes — the form of the parasite when it enters the skin of a host. However, it’s advisable to get medical treatment if you have any kind of infection.

The bottom line
There is limited research to suggest that there are health benefits of sassafras tea. However, sassafras oil is toxic to humans. Some of this toxicity may be present in sassafras tea.
Some evidence suggests that sassafras tea may actually cause negative health effects. Safrole, a compound in sassafras oil, may promote cancer growth. Thus, the FDA has banned its use in foods.
You should not drink sassafras tea. It’s best to contact a doctor for advice on a suitable treatment plan if they have concerns about a medical condition or symptoms.
