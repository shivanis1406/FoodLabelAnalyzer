Title: 6 Symptoms of Candida Overgrowth (Plus How to Get Rid of It)

Symptoms of  Candida  overgrowth include mouth lesions, fatigue, and digestive issues. Addressing the underlying cause can help ease symptoms and prevent recurring infections.
Many types of fungi live in and on the human body, including the genus of yeasts known as  Candida .
Candida  is typically found in small amounts in the mouth and intestines and on the skin.
At normal levels, the fungus is not problematic. However, when  Candida  begins to grow uncontrollably, it can cause an infection known as  candidiasis .
In fact,  Candida  is one of the most common causes of  fungal infections  in humans ( 1 ,  2 ).
This article explores 6 symptoms of  Candida  overgrowth, how it’s caused, and how you can treat it.
Typically, the healthy bacteria in your body keep  Candida  levels under control. However, if healthy bacteria levels are disrupted or the immune system is compromised,  Candida  can begin to overproduce.
Below are a few factors that can lead to  Candida  overgrowth ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ):
taking antibiotics
eating a diet high in sugar and  refined carbs
high alcohol intake
a weakened  immune system
taking oral contraceptives
diabetes
high  stress levels
When  Candida  begins to overproduce, it can lead to health problems.

What are the signs and symptoms of Candida?
Candida can cause a range of signs and symptoms, depending on which part of the body it affects.
Candidiasis that develops in the mouth or throat is called “thrush.”
It’s most common in newborns, older adults, and people with a weakened immune system ( 8 ).
Individuals with poor  oral hygiene  or removable  dentures  are also at an increased risk ( 9 ).
People with  oral thrush  typically develop white, bumpy patches on their tongue, inner cheeks, gums,  tonsils , or throat ( 10 ).
The lesions can be painful and may bleed slightly when scraped.
Oral thrush  is also often associated with redness or soreness of the tongue and mouth ( 10 ).
In severe cases, it can spread to the  esophagus  and cause pain or  difficulty swallowing .
When there is too much  Candida  in the mouth, it can cause white, bumpy lesions, redness, and pain in the mouth and throat. This is also known as oral thrush.
One of the most common symptoms associated with  Candida  is fatigue.
While there’s no evidence that  Candida  causes fatigue, there are a couple of ways in which it could contribute to it.
First, candidiasis is often accompanied by  nutritional deficiencies , such as  vitamin B6 ,  essential fatty acids , and magnesium ( 11 ).
In particular,  magnesium deficiency  has been known to cause fatigue ( 12 ).
Second,  Candida  infections commonly occur when the immune system is weakened.
A low-functioning immune system in itself may leave you feeling tired and fatigued.
One older study from 1995 suggests that prolonged candidiasis of the gut may even be a potential cause of  chronic fatigue syndrome . However, more research is needed ( 13 ).
Candidiasis is most common in individuals with a weakened immune system and may be accompanied by various nutritional deficiencies. This can leave you feeling tired and fatigued.
Candida  is found in the vaginal tracts of about 20% of females ( 14 ).
An overgrowth of  Candida  can lead to candidiasis of the vagina, also known as a  yeast infection .
It is estimated that 1.4 million people visit a doctor for a  vaginal yeast infection  each year in the United States ( 14 ).
Males can also get  genital yeast infections , but it’s much less common ( 15 ).
Symptoms of vaginal candidiasis include redness, swelling, itching,  painful intercourse , and a thick, white  discharge  from the vagina ( 16 ).
Although not common,  Candida  can also cause a  urinary tract infection  (UTI).
Candida -related urinary tract infections are most common in older adults and hospitalized or immune-compromised individuals ( 17 ).
Symptoms of a UTI  include a burning feeling when you urinate, a  frequent urge to urinate , cloudy, dark, or strange-smelling urine, and pain or pressure in your lower abdomen ( 18 ).
That being said, other bacteria like  E. coli  are more likely to cause UTIs ( 18 ).
However, if you experience recurring infections and believe they are a result of  Candida  overgrowth, you can talk to a doctor about having your  urine tested  to find out.
Candida  can cause genital and urinary tract infections, both of which can lead to pain and discomfort.
The health of your digestive system relies heavily on a good balance between the “good” and “bad”  bacteria that live in your gut .
The “good” bacteria that normally reside in your gut are important for digestion, as they help process starches, fibers, and some sugars.
When the bacteria in your gut become imbalanced, you can experience digestive issues, including  constipation , diarrhea, nausea,  gas , cramps, and bloating ( 19 ).
Recent studies indicate that an overgrowth of  Candida  is associated with several diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, including ulcerative colitis and  Crohn’s disease  ( 20 ,  21 ).
Having small amounts of  Candida  in your gut is normal. However, if it starts to overproduce, it may cause various gut-related symptoms.
Just like in your gut, there are bacteria on your skin that prevent  Candida  from growing uncontrollably.
All bacteria thrive in different conditions, including varying temperature, moisture, or acidity levels.
For this reason, a change in the environment on your skin can allow  Candida  to overproduce ( 22 ).
For example, antibacterial cosmetics, soaps, and moisturizers can often alter skin conditions ( 23 ).
While skin candidiasis can affect any part of the body, areas that are warm and moist, such as the armpits and groin, are particularly prone to infection ( 24 ).
Itching and a visible rash are the two most common symptoms of  skin fungal infections .
While not life-threatening, skin fungal infections can cause several unpleasant and uncomfortable symptoms.
An overgrowth of  Candida  on the skin can cause symptoms like itching and a visible rash.
If a  Candida  infection enters your bloodstream and travels through your body, it can infect the joints and cause  arthritis  ( 25 ).
This typically only happens after surgery or when an overgrowth of  Candida  is left untreated for an extended period of time.
Candida  arthritis is associated with pain,  stiffness , and swelling in your joints and often affects the hips and knees.
Candida  can also cause  bone infections , or  osteomyelitis , which can cause pain and tenderness in the infected area ( 26 ).
While bone and  joint infections  are not very common, they can be challenging to treat and often require medications prescribed by a doctor ( 27 ).
If an overgrowth of  Candida  is left untreated, it can enter your bloodstream and travel throughout your entire body. When this happens,  Candida  can infect bones and joints, causing pain, stiffness, and swelling.

Candida diet
The food you eat plays an important role in maintaining the balance of beneficial bacteria in your gut.
In particular,  foods high in sugar , refined grains, dairy products,  processed meats , and alcohol may promote the growth of  Candida  ( 28 ).
While more research is needed, one study found that people who avoided these foods during treatment for  Candida  had better outcomes after 3 months ( 28 ).
Additionally, certain foods may help protect against  Candida  infections , including:
Garlic:   Garlic  contains several antifungal compounds like allicin, some of which have been shown to act against  Candida  yeasts in test-tube studies ( 29 ,  30 ).
Coconut oil:   Coconut oil  is high in  lauric acid , which has been shown to fight  Candida  infections in multiple test-tube studies ( 31 ,  32 ).
Curcumin:  Test-tube studies indicate that  curcumin  may kill  Candida  yeasts, or at least reduce their growth ( 33 ).
Xylitol:  According to one test-tube study,  xylitol  may possess powerful antimicrobial properties and could help reduce  Candida  growth ( 34 ).
Aloe vera:  Test-tube studies suggest that  aloe vera gel  may inhibit the growth of  Candida , which could help protect against infection ( 35 ).
Pomegranate:  One animal study showed that certain compounds found in  pomegranate  peel extract could be beneficial against  Candida  yeasts ( 36 ).
Kombucha:   Kombucha tea  is rich in tea  polyphenols  and acetic acid, both of which have been shown to kill  Candida  in test-tube studies ( 37 ).
Probiotics:   Probiotics  like  Lactobacillus  and  Saccharomyces boulardii  may reduce  Candida  growth and protect against infections ( 38 ,  39 ).

What’s the best way to treat Candida?
The best way to treat candidiasis and prevent recurring infections is to address the underlying cause.
A doctor may prescribe an antifungal drug, such as:
nystatin
clotrimazole
amphotericin B
miconazole
econazole
fluconazole
The type of drug and the dosage will depend on the severity and location of the infection. In some cases, a single dose will clear the infection. In others, a person may need ongoing treatment for up to 6 months ( 15 ).

Frequently asked questions about Candida
A doctor can prescribe  antifungal medications  such as nyastatin or clotrimazole. These are available as pills or creams, depending on which part of the body Candida affects and how severe the infection is ( 15 ).
The time it takes to clear Candida will also depend on the severity of the infection and how soon a person gets treatment. Some cases only need a single treatment, For recurring vaginal infections, however, you may need treatment for up to 6 months ( 15 ).
No foods can cure Candida, but items that are high in sugar, refined grains, dairy products,  processed meats , and alcohol may make it worse. Foods that may help protect you from an infection include garlic, curcumin, kombucha, and probiotics.

The bottom line
Several factors can contribute to  Candida  overgrowth, including certain medications, underlying health conditions, and lifestyle factors.
Modifying your diet may be beneficial for candidiasis and could help ease symptoms related to infection, including fatigue,  joint pain , and digestive issues.
A doctor can also help identify the cause of infection and determine the best course of treatment based on your needs.
