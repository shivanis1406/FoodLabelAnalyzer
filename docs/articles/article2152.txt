Title: 12 Excellent Keto Options at Chili’s

The popular Tex-Mex restaurant Chili’s can be found all across the United States. If you’re following the keto diet, you may not be sure what to order there.
Several meals at Chili’s can be modified to be keto-friendly.
On the keto diet, most people aim to eat about 25 grams of net carbs — total carbs minus fiber — per day. All the items in this list contain 0–24 grams of net carbs per order. We recommend splitting the higher carb items into two meals ( 1 ).
Here are 15 keto-friendly dishes at Chili’s, along with helpful ordering tips.

1. Appetizers
The Bone-in Wings from Chili’s make an excellent keto option that’s  loaded with fat  and protein. It’s easy to split this order in two or share it with a friend.
To keep these wings keto, choose only Buffalo sauce or skip the sauce entirely since all of the other sauces are high in carbs.
Here’s the nutrient info for one order of Bone-in Wings with Buffalo Sauce ( 2 ):
Calories:  890
Fat:  65 grams
Protein:  73 grams
Total carbs:  4 grams
Fiber:  1 gram

Ask for the Bone-in Wings with Buffalo Sauce, or ask for them without sauce.

2–8. Entrées
In my opinion, there’s no keto-friendly option more delicious than steak.
Chili’s offers two sizes of its Classic Sirloin for large and small appetites. Keep it keto by choosing  low carb  sides like steamed  broccoli  or a side salad without croutons.

Tips for eating keto at Chili’s
If you want to choose something else from the Chili’s menu, here are a few pointers to help you make your meal as keto-friendly as possible:
Choose simple meat entrées.  To make eating keto at Chili’s more doable, choose a basic entrée with nothing added, such as steak, grilled  salmon , or a bunless burger.
Add keto-friendly sides.  Choose low carb sides like asparagus or steamed broccoli to keep the carb count low.
Avoid hidden carbs.  Some Chili’s items are full of hidden carbs, such as the chicken wings in any flavor (except Buffalo). Likewise, the ribs are slathered in sugary BBQ sauce, and the coleslaw is also high in carbs ( 2 ).
Select low carb dressings.  Ordering  salad ? Stick to keto-friendly  salad dressings  like Ancho Chile Ranch, Avocado Ranch, Bleu Cheese, Caesar, Ranch, and Santa Fe.
Plan ahead.  Glance at the menu and nutrition information ahead of time to better plan out a keto-friendly meal that you’ll enjoy.

The bottom line
With a few modifications, it’s fairly straightforward to  eat keto  at Chili’s.
If you’re in the mood for wings, stick to ones without sauce or Buffalo Bone-in Wings.
For entrées, bunless burgers, steak, salmon, salads with no tortilla strips, or a split order of fajitas with no tortillas are your best bet. Round out your meal with low carb sides like asparagus, broccoli, or a side salad with no croutons.
If you’re able, check out the menu and nutrition information ahead of time.
Try this today:  Don’t be afraid to order a bunless burger and add your own bun. I’ve done it before, and I’m sure I’ll do it again.
My favorite keto-friendly burger buns are Base Culture’s Original Keto Buns, which contain 4 grams of net carbs each. They need to be kept frozen, but if you’re heading out you can defrost and toast one, then carry it with you in a resealable bag.
