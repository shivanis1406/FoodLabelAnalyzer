Title: 9 of the Best Replacements for Sesame Oil

Potential replacements for sesame oil include olive oil, grapeseed oil, walnut oil, avocado oil, and peanut oil.
Known for its nutty taste and aroma, sesame oil gives many dishes — like salad dressings, noodles, and chicken recipes — their signature sesame flavor.
However, if you’re allergic to sesame seeds or find yourself fresh out of sesame oil, you’ll be looking for an alternative.
Here are 9 of the best substitutes for sesame oil.

1–5. Substitutes for regular sesame oil
Regular sesame oil is made from raw sesame seeds. It’s often used as a cooking oil or added to marinades to impart a nutty, earthy flavor.
Here are some substitutes that you can use in a pinch.
Olive oil  is a great alternative to sesame oil, thanks to its ability to be used in many different ways and its impressive nutrient profile.
In fact, olive oil is renowned for its many potential health benefits. This is because it provides polyphenol antioxidants and heart-healthy  monounsaturated fats  ( 1 ).
You can use an equal amount of olive oil in place of sesame oil for cooking, as well as in marinades and sauces like teriyaki sauce.
Be sure to opt for light olive oil, which has a milder, more neutral flavor than regular olive oil.
Grapeseed  oil is a popular vegetable oil with a neutral taste, making it an excellent addition to a variety of recipes.
It’s especially high in polyunsaturated fatty acids and packs a hearty dose of  vitamin E  in each serving. Vitamin E may help prevent inflammation by neutralizing harmful compounds called free radicals ( 2 ).
For best results, use grapeseed oil in a 1:1 ratio for sesame oil in marinades, stir-fries, and noodle dishes.
As its name suggests,  walnut oil  is extracted from walnuts.
It’s a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been studied extensively for their ability to decrease inflammation and protect against heart disease ( 3 ,  4 ).
Walnut oil has a rich, nutty taste that becomes slightly bitter when cooked. So, it’s best as a swap for sesame oil in recipes that don’t require cooking, such as sauces or  salad dressings .
You can also drizzle it over finished meat and pasta dishes for added flavor.
Avocado oil boasts a light flavor and high smoke point. This is the temperature at which a fat begins to break down and produce smoke.
It’s rich in many antioxidants, including  lutein  — a compound that’s essential for eye health ( 5 ).
Because of its high smoke point,  avocado oil  is suitable for dishes cooked on a higher heat, like fried rice. It can replace sesame oil in a 1:1 ratio.
Peanut oil  is a common substitute for sesame oil, especially for people with a sesame allergy. (However, if you have a peanut allergy, you may want to avoid this oil and try a different one instead.)
In addition to providing a good amount of vitamin E, peanut oil is high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, both of which support  heart health  ( 6 ).
Its mild flavor and high smoke point make it ideal for cooking dishes like fried rice, noodles, stir-fries, and chicken.
Substitutes for regular sesame oil include olive, grapeseed, walnut, avocado, and peanut oils.

6–9. Substitutes for toasted sesame oil
Toasted sesame oil is made from seeds that have been toasted, giving it a deeper hue, thicker consistency, and richer, more pronounced taste.
Unlike regular sesame oil, it isn’t suitable for high heat cooking methods. Instead, it’s typically used on finished or uncooked dishes to add flavor.
Here are a few swaps for toasted sesame oil.
Combining toasted sesame seeds with a light, mild oil, such as  canola  or avocado oil, is a great alternative to toasted sesame oil.
Not only are these seeds a great source of fiber and protein, but they’re also rich in micronutrients like thiamine,  niacin , magnesium, and zinc ( 7 ).
Generally, you should use about 1 part  sesame seeds  with 4 parts oil to closely match the flavor of toasted sesame oil in dishes like dumpling sauce.
Still, you can adjust the ratio or skip the oil altogether if you want to use the toasted seeds alone as a garnish for certain dishes, including chicken, tofu, or sautéed vegetables.
Perilla oil  is a made by pressing the seeds of the perilla plant.
Its rich, nutty flavor makes it a fantastic substitute for toasted sesame oil.
What’s more, it’s a great source of  omega-3 fatty acids  and has been shown to support several aspects of health, including mental health ( 8 ).
Made from toasted white sesame seeds, Chinese sesame paste is a flavorful  condiment  often featured in salads, stir-fries, and noodle dishes.
It has a deep hue and nutty taste that’s very similar to toasted sesame oil.
Because of its thick, paste-like consistency, it works best mixed into dishes rather than used as a  cooking oil . However, you can also combine it with a little oil to thin it out and achieve the consistency of sesame oil.
Roasted peanut oil is a fragrant finishing oil that’s often drizzled over dishes or added to salad dressings and sauces. (However, if you’re allergic to peanuts, you may want to avoid roasted peanut oil.)
Like sesame oil, it contains a balanced mix of heart-healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats in each serving ( 9 ).
Plus, it’s rich in vitamin E, a fat-soluble vitamin that also acts as an  antioxidant  to protect against cell damage and oxidative stress ( 9 ,  10 ).
You can swap perilla oil, toasted sesame seeds, Chinese sesame paste, and roasted peanut oil for toasted sesame oil.

The bottom line
Sesame oil is a versatile cooking oil that’s highly nutritious and associated with  several health benefits .
However, if you don’t have any on hand or are  allergic  to sesame seeds, several other oils make good substitutes.
Try using some of the ingredients above for an easy way to boost the flavor, nutritional value, and antioxidant content of your favorite dishes.
Try this today:  Using other oils in place of sesame oil can slightly alter the taste and texture of your dish. Try experimenting with other ingredients, such as roasted nuts,  tahini , or pine nuts, to enhance the flavor of your favorite recipes.
