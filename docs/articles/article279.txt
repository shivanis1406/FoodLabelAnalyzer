Title: The 10 Best Low Carb & Keto-Friendly Protein Powders

If you’re following a low carb or ketogenic (keto) diet, you may use protein powders to supplement your diet.
While you can likely meet your protein needs with food alone, protein powders offer a convenient and easy way to increase your intake.
However, choosing the right one to fit your low carb or keto lifestyle can be challenging, as there are countless protein powder forms and sources.
Most protein powders are low in carbohydrates; however, many are made from foods that naturally contain carbohydrates or are blended with carbohydrates.
“Most protein powders are lower in carbohydrates; it often depends on the source they come from, such as dairy, pea proteins, or soy, along with added sugars to increase palatability,” explains  Cari Riker , registered dietitian and certified diabetes care and education specialist based in Nashville, Tennessee.
We have found the best protein powders to fit a low-carbohydrate diet, many of which are also keto-friendly.

Types of proteins
Source:  dairy
Pros:  high quality source of protein that’s easily digested and quickly absorbed ( 1 )
Protein volume:  whey protein isolate must have at least 89.5% protein by weight, whereas whey protein concentrate is required to have at least 79.5% protein by weight ( 2 )
There are two types of whey protein:  concentrate and isolate .
Whey protein isolate is the purest form of whey protein you can buy, and it has the highest percentage of protein and the lowest number of carbs per serving of any whey protein. It contains few — or even zero — carbohydrates per scoop.
Source:  dairy
Pros:  slower to digest, which may benefit overnight muscle protein synthesis ( 3 )
Protein volume:  many casein protein powders have at least 80% protein by weight
Casein  is the other milk protein. Unlike whey, casein is digested and absorbed much more slowly, making it a popular choice for overnight recovery.
Casein powders has few carbs and generous amounts of protein. They can also be a source of calcium, an important mineral your body needs for  bone health , muscle contractions, and blood clotting ( 4 ).
Source:  eggs
Pros:   eggs  are nutrient-dense; they’re a source of protein, choline, vitamins A, D, and E, and multiple B vitamins ( 5 )
Protein volume:  protein makes up 12.5% of the weight of a whole egg; the protein percentage of egg-based protein powders varies depending on whether they’re made from egg whites, yolk, or both ( 5 )
Most egg-based protein powders are made from egg white. Egg white protein powders are manufactured by removing the yolks and dehydrating the remaining whites to create a powder.
The  egg whites  are then pasteurized to deactivate avidin, a protein that inhibits the absorption of biotin, an essential B vitamin ( 6 ).
However, some egg protein powders are purely egg yolk, while others are a combination of white and yolk. Depending on the type of egg protein powder you choose, the specific nutrient values for things like cholesterol and protein will vary significantly.
Source:  usually cowhide, cow bones, chicken bones, eggshell membranes, and fish scales
Pros:  may aid in injury prevention when taken prior to exercise; plays a role in skin aging and wound healing ( 7 ,  8 )
Protein volume:  many collagen supplements are 90% or more protein by weight
Collagen  protein powder, or collagen peptides, is often tasteless and unflavored and is made from animal sources.
It’s the most common structural protein in your body, and is found in your hair, skin, nails, bones, ligaments, and tendons ( 8 ).
Research shows that collagen may play a role in injury prevention when taken prior to exercise. However, it’s lacking in tryptophan, an essential amino acid, making it an incomplete protein and not optimal for muscle protein synthesis ( 8 ,  9 ).
Source:  soybeans (a  legume )
Pros:  aids in muscle protein synthesis after resistance training ( 10 )
Protein volume:  greater than 90% protein by weight ( 11 )
Soy protein powder is created by grinding  soybeans  into a meal and then into soy protein isolate, which is high in protein and very low in carbohydrates ( 11 ).
Manufacturers sometimes add sugar or other additives to plant-based protein powders like soy, which increases total carbohydrates. However, this isn’t always the case, which makes it important to check labels carefully.
Studies have shown that soy protein can be as effective for muscle protein synthesis as animal-based protein, including whey ( 10 ,  12 ).
Soy protein is a high quality protein alternative for people allergic to milk or anyone looking for a plant-based protein.
Source:  peas (legume)
Pros:  allergy-friendly, high quality protein that may have similar muscle repair and growth benefits to animal protein when eaten after resistance training ( 13 )
Protein volume:  <85% protein by weight ( 14 )
Peas naturally have between 20% and 25% protein ( 14 ).
Like soy protein isolate,  pea  protein powder is made by grinding dried peas, which naturally contain protein, into a powder and extracting the carbs ( 15 ).
However, manufacturers sometimes add  sugar  — and therefore carbs — to increase palatability, so you’ll want to carefully review ingredient labels.
Source:  rice
Pros:  rice is hypoallergenic, so it’s unlikely to cause allergic reactions; plus, this type of protein is plant-based
Protein volume:  90% of protein by weight ( 16 )
Rice protein powder is typically made by treating  brown rice  with enzymes that cause the carbs to separate from the proteins.
All whole grains, including rice, are made up of three parts: bran, endosperm, and germ. The endosperm is the largest part of the grain and is made up of starch and protein ( 17 ).
Rice is a source of essential amino acids, but some concentrations are higher than others. For this reason, it’s often used as a blend with other plant-based proteins to improve the amino acid profile ( 18 ).

How to choose
Consider these important attributes before choosing a protein powder that will fit into your low carb or keto diet.
Third-party testing:  It’s important to choose only third-party tested protein powders to ensure the purity and potency of the product you choose. Look for NSF Certified for Sport and Informed Choice Certified products whenever possible.
Total carb content:  If you’re following a low carb or keto diet, total carbohydrate intake should be kept within a specific range based on the diet you’re following. Most protein powders will have less than 10 g of carbohydrates per serving, with many containing under 5 g. “Some of those carbohydrates can come from added sugars, so looking for a powder that has minimal to no added sugars can help to minimize carbohydrate intake,” Riker said.
Protein source:  Protein powders are made from many types of proteins. Some are single-source powders, while others are made from a blend of protein sources. Choose a protein powder made from a protein source that fits your dietary restrictions and preferences.
Allergens:  Some protein powders contain major allergens like milk, soy, tree nuts, or wheat. Read the labels carefully as you shop to ensure the protein powder you choose doesn’t contain an ingredient you need to avoid due to allergies.
Cost:  Protein powder costs vary widely, and the cost per serving should be considered when choosing the best option for you. This will also make sure that you choose a protein powder that’s financially sustainable, if you choose to take it for a long time.

How to add flavor to unflavored products
If you spring for an unflavored animal- or plant-based protein powder, there are several ways to make them tastier while still staying within your daily carbohydrate range:
Add small amounts of cocoa powder.
Stir the powder into low carb beverages.
Drizzle in sugar-free syrups.
Spoon in artificial sweeteners like Splenda or natural sweeteners, including stevia or  monk fruit extract .
Use unflavored protein powders in baking.
Stir in sugar-free, flavored pudding mixes.
Add natural flavor extracts or spices, such as cinnamon.

Frequently asked questions
Yes, protein powder can be a good choice for those on a low carb diet if you need a convenient way to boost total protein intake. Many protein powders are very low in carbohydrates, especially those made without added sugar or other carbohydrate sources.

Building muscle requires following an exercise training regimen incorporating strength training while meeting daily energy and protein needs.
Protein powders can help ensure you’re getting sufficient protein to support muscle maintenance and repair, but your total energy needs must also be met.
Low carbohydrate protein powders made from high quality protein sources that contain the essential amino acids required to promote muscle growth and maintenance are similarly effective as regular protein powders that contain more carbohydrates.
Some research indicates that eating a combination of protein and carbohydrates after exercise is more beneficial for muscle protein synthesis than eating protein alone ( 25 ).

Protein powders can be a convenient addition to the diet, but they shouldn’t be used as the primary source of protein.
“Although protein powders can be a convenient way to help meet increased protein needs, trying to meet your protein requirements from whole foods can help ensure you are consuming other nutrients your body needs and can be more satisfying than replacing a meal with a protein powder,” said Riker.

The bottom line
Protein powders are an easy and versatile way to supplement your diet.
Many are inherently low in carbs, but some manufacturers often add sugar or other ingredients to improve flavor, which increases total carbohydrates.
Each type of protein offers unique benefits and can be a potentially beneficial low carb addition to your diet.
Choose from several protein powders that best fit your needs to optimize your low carb or  keto diet  based on your preferences and goals.
