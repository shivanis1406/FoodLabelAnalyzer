Title: The Paleo Diet — A Beginner's Guide Plus Meal Plan

The paleo diet includes whole, unprocessed foods like vegetables, nuts, seeds, and meat. It may benefit your overall health and reduce your risk for some health conditions, including obesity.
The paleo diet is designed to resemble what human hunter-gatherer ancestors ate thousands of years ago.
Although it’s impossible to know exactly what human ancestors ate in different parts of the world, researchers believe their diets consisted of whole foods.
By following a diet of whole foods and leading physically active lives, hunter-gatherers presumably had much lower rates of lifestyle diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.
This diet may lead to significant  weight loss  (without calorie counting) and major improvements in health.
Anthropologists also speculate that the paleo diet influenced anatomic and physiologic changes in humans, including increased brain size and reduced gastrointestinal tract size ( 1 ).
This article is a basic introduction to the paleo diet, providing a simple meal plan and other essential information.

A paleo diet meal plan
Paleolithic humans thrived on various diets, depending on what was available at the time and where in the world they lived.
Some ate a  low carb diet  high in animal foods, while others followed a high carb diet with lots of plants ( 1 ).
Some even ate insects, but fortunately, this delicacy is not included in today’s modern interpretation of the paleo diet.
The paleo diet plan includes ( 2 ):
unprocessed meats
fish
eggs
vegetables
fruits
nuts
seeds
herbs
spices
nutritious fats and  oils
Foods to avoid typically include ( 2 ):
processed foods
added sugar
soft drinks
artificial sweeteners
Foods to limit include ( 2 ):
grains
most dairy products
legumes
However, it’s important to consider the above as general guidelines, not something written in stone. You can adapt all of this to your own personal needs and preferences.
Paleolithic humans’ diets varied depending on availability and location. The basic concept of the paleo diet is to eat whole foods and avoid  processed foods .

Foods to avoid on the paleo diet
The paleo diet discourages the consumption of certain foods, including:
Sugar and high-fructose corn syrup:  soft drinks, fruit juices, table sugar, candy, pastries, ice cream, and many others
Grains:  bread, pasta, wheat, cereal, spelt, rye, barley, etc.
Legumes:  beans, lentils, and many more
Dairy:  most dairy, especially  low fat dairy  (some versions of paleo do include full-fat dairy like butter and cheese)
Some vegetable oils:  soybean oil, sunflower oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, grapeseed oil, safflower oil, and others
Artificial sweeteners:  aspartame, sucralose, cyclamates, saccharin, acesulfame potassium (use  natural sweeteners  instead)
Highly processed foods : everything labeled “diet” or “low fat” or that has many  additives , including artificial meal replacements
A simple guideline for the paleo diet is, if it looks like it was made in a factory, avoid it.
To avoid these ingredients, you must  read ingredient lists  and nutrition labels, even on foods labeled as “health foods.”
Foods to avoid on the paleo diet include  processed foods  and ingredients, like sugar, bread, certain vegetable oils, and artificial sweeteners.

Foods to eat on the paleo diet
You can eat a variety of whole, unprocessed foods  on the paleo diet . This includes:
Meat:  Beef, lamb, chicken, turkey, pork, and others
Fish and seafood:  salmon, trout, haddock, shrimp, shellfish, etc (choose wild-caught if you can)
Eggs:  may be free-range, pastured, or omega-3 enriched
Vegetables:  broccoli, kale, peppers, onions, carrots, tomatoes, etc.
Fruits:  apples, bananas, oranges, pears, avocados, strawberries, blueberries, and more.
Tubers:  potatoes, sweet potatoes, yams, turnips, etc.
Nuts and seeds:  almonds, macadamia nuts, walnuts, hazelnuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and more
Healthy fats and oils:  extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, and others
Salt and spices:  sea salt, garlic, turmeric, rosemary, etc.
Many people prefer grass-fed meats,  pastured eggs , and organic produce while following a paleo diet. However, this is not required.
Eat whole, unprocessed foods like meat, seafood, eggs, veggies, fruits, potatoes, nuts, healthy fats, and spices while on the paleo diet. If possible, choose  grass-fed  and organic products.

Modified paleo diets
There are now several different versions of the paleo diet. Some allow more modern foods, such as grass-fed butter and  gluten-free grains  like rice.
Today, many people think of paleo as a template to base your diet on, not necessarily a strict set of rules you must follow.
You can also use the paleo diet as a starting point, adding in a few other healthy foods like grass-fed butter and gluten-free grains.

Sensible indulgences
While following a paleo diet, the below foods and beverages below are perfectly fine in small amounts:
Wine:  Quality red wine is not only part of the paleo diet, but it is high in antioxidants,  polyphenols , and beneficial nutrients ( 3 ,  4 ).
Dark chocolate:  Dark chocolate is very high in antioxidants and important minerals like magnesium and iron. Choose a product with 70% or higher cocoa content ( 3 ,  5 ,  6 ).
When following the paleo diet, you can indulge in small amounts of red wine and dark chocolate from time to time.

What to drink on the paleo diet
When it comes to hydration, water should be your go-to beverage.
The following drinks aren’t strictly paleo but are typically accepted as beverages you can consume as part of the diet ( 3 ):
Tea:  Tea, especially green tea, is very healthy and loaded with antioxidants and various beneficial compounds ( 7 ).
Coffee:  Coffee is very high in antioxidants as well. Studies show that it has many  health benefits  ( 8 ).
Make water your drink of choice when following the paleo diet. Many people also drink tea and coffee.

Risks and downsides
While there are many benefits to the paleo diet, there are also some drawbacks.
For example, the paleo diet eliminates several food groups that are highly nutritious, including legumes, dairy, and gluten-containing grains.
Legumes are rich in fiber, protein, and various micronutrients, including iron, zinc, and copper, while dairy products have essential nutrients like calcium, which is important for bone health ( 9 ,  10 ).
Eliminating these food groups can put individuals following a paleo diet at risk of developing nutrient deficiencies.
In addition, legumes are one of the primary protein sources in the vegan and vegetarian diet, which may make the paleo diet unrealistic for  vegans and vegetarians  ( 11 ).
The paleo diet includes foods high in fiber, like vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Since foods high in fiber can have a laxative effect, a person transitioning from a low fiber diet to a paleo diet could experience gastric distress, such as bloating, as a result ( 12 ,  13 ).
It’s important to recognize that there’s no one “right” way to eat for everyone, so while the paleo diet may work for people you know, it may not be best for you.
You may want to talk with a doctor or nutritionist before starting a paleo diet.
The paleo diet eliminates several food groups that are highly nutritious and may cause bloating in some people. You can ask a doctor if the paleo diet is right for you.
