Title: 6 Ways to Reduce Water Retention (Edema)

Dietary and lifestyle changes may help reduce water retention and promote fluid balance. You may consider eating more fruits, vegetables, and herbs and limiting processed foods and refined carbs.
Water retention , also known as  edema  or fluid retention, occurs when excess fluids build up in your body. This may cause swelling in your feet, ankles, hands, and legs ( peripheral edema ).
Edema could have several causes, such as:
hormonal changes or  pregnancy
lack of physical activity
chronic kidney disease
congestive heart failure
capillary leak syndrome
lymphatic dysfunction (lymphedema)
obesity
malnutrition
infections that may trigger  inflammation  and swelling
allergies
certain  medications , including:  oral contraceptives corticosteroids nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs calcium channel blockers some  diabetes medications
oral contraceptives
corticosteroids
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
calcium channel blockers
some  diabetes medications
Sometimes, fluid retention may be a symptom of a serious medical condition that could require medical treatment.
But if your swelling is mild and you don’t have an underlying health condition, you may be able to reduce water retention with these six methods.

1. Eat less salt
Salt  is made up of sodium and chloride.
Sodium binds to water in your body and helps maintain the balance of fluids inside and outside your cells.
If you often eat foods that are high in salt, such as many  packaged foods , your body may retain water. These foods are the  biggest dietary source of sodium  in most Western diets.
The most common advice for reducing water retention is to decrease  sodium intake . However, the research on this is mixed.
Some studies suggest that  increased sodium intake  leads to increased fluid retention. However,  many other factors  are also involved in regulating fluid balance, and the effects of salt on water retention may vary from person to person.

2. Increase magnesium intake
Magnesium  is a key mineral involved in  more than 300  enzymatic reactions that keep your body functioning properly.
Some research suggests that increasing your magnesium intake may help reduce water retention.
For example, one  older study  found that taking 250 milligrams of magnesium per day improved several symptoms of  premenstrual syndrome (PMS) , including water retention and bloating. However, further studies are necessary to explore magnesium’s role in decreasing water retention.
Good  sources of magnesium  include nuts, whole grains, and leafy green vegetables. It’s also available as a  supplement .

3. Get more vitamin B6
Vitamin B6 , also known as pyridoxine, is a water-soluble vitamin that  plays a central role  in:
red blood cell  formation
protein metabolism
brain  function
immune health
It also regulates fluid balance and may help reduce water retention.
One  2012 study  suggests that vitamin B6 may decrease bloating and fluid buildup in women with PMS. The authors of a  2016 study  describe similar findings, adding that vitamin B6 may be even more effective when combined with  calcium supplements .
However, research on vitamin B6’s fluid-retention effects outside of PMS is lacking.
If you want to increase your vitamin B6 intake, you can do so by eating foods such as:
bananas
potatoes
chickpeas
walnuts
tuna

4. Eat more potassium-rich foods
Potassium serves  several important functions , especially regarding  heart  health,  muscle contractions , and  nerve  function.
It’s also essential for maintaining blood volume and fluid balance to help decrease water retention. It works by  counteracting the effects of sodium  to prevent fluid buildup and swelling, as well as by increasing urine production.
Low potassium levels  may also increase :
blood pressure
risk for  kidney stones
bone turnover
urinary calcium excretion
salt sensitivity
Foods that are  high in potassium , such as bananas,  avocados , and  tomatoes , can help support healthy fluid balance.

5. Try dandelion
Dandelion  ( Taraxacum officinale ) has long been used as a  natural diuretic  in folk medicine. It may help  reduce water retention  by increasing urine production.
In  a small older study , 17 people took 3 doses of dandelion leaf extract over 24 hours, which led to a significant increase in urine production.
Other studies in test tubes and animals suggest that the diuretic properties of dandelion leaf extract may also  help protect  against conditions such as kidney stones.
Additionally, dandelion may have antiviral, antifungal, and antioxidant benefits.
However, larger, more recent studies are necessary to support these benefits.
Speak with a healthcare professional before adding dandelion supplements to your routine.

6. Limit your refined carb intake
Refined carb sources  such as white bread and pasta are typically high in carbs or added sugar and low in fiber. As a result, consuming these foods may lead to  rapid spikes  in blood sugar and insulin levels.
High  insulin levels  may cause more sodium retention by increasing sodium reabsorption in your kidneys. In turn, this  may lead to more fluid volume  in your body and increased water retention.
Additionally, your  liver  and muscles store carbs as  glycogen , a form of sugar that is bound to water. Each gram of glycogen is stored with at least  3 grams  of water, so following a high carb diet could increase water retention.
Fiber-rich  whole grains , such as oats, brown rice, and whole wheat bread, are better food sources than refined carbohydrates.

Other remedies to reduce water retention
Certain natural remedies may also help reduce water retention by increasing urine production and decreasing inflammation. These might include  drinking more water , increasing your physical activity, or consuming foods or supplements such as:
horsetail
parsley
hibiscus
fennel
corn silk
nettle
However, some of these tips are supported only by anecdotal evidence, not by research.
Speak with a healthcare professional before adding supplements to your diet, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.

Frequently asked questions
Water retention, also known as edema or fluid retention, occurs when excess fluid builds up in your body.
Swelling in your ankles, feet, hands, or legs is a common symptom.
If dietary or lifestyle changes don’t help reduce inflammation, speak with a doctor. Water retention may be a symptom of a serious condition.
Several conditions, diseases, and dietary or lifestyle habits may cause water retention. Examples include:
hormonal changes or pregnancy
lack of physical activity
chronic kidney disease
congestive heart failure
capillary leak syndrome
lymphatic dysfunction (lymphedema)
obesity
malnutrition
allergies
infections
certain medications, such as oral contraceptives and corticosteroids
You may be able to help reduce water retention and promote fluid balance by making certain dietary and lifestyle changes, such as:
reducing sodium and refined carb intake
increasing potassium, vitamin B6, or magnesium intake
trying certain herbs such as dandelion, horsetail, or parsley

Takeaway
Many factors could contribute to water retention. Though medical treatments may be necessary depending on the cause, several simple dietary and lifestyle changes may help reduce water retention and promote fluid balance.
Following a  balanced diet  and limiting processed foods and refined carbs may be especially beneficial.
If water retention persists even after you’ve made changes to your diet or lifestyle, consult a healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment.
