Title: We Tested Over 50 Nonalcoholic Drinks and Mixers: Here Are the Best Ones

While some people are looking to ditch alcohol completely for health reasons, others may simply want to reduce their consumption.
And while a nondrinker’s options used to be limited to juice, soda, and water, there’s now a whole industry devoted to creating beverages that provide the same flavor complexity without the negative side effects of alcohol.
In fact, according to Joshua Carlos, senior vice president of Lyre’s North America, the world of nonalcoholic beverages is “currently the fastest growing category of beverage, with over 30% growth year on year.”
We tried more than 50 different nonalcoholic products, as well as a handful of flavored seltzers, soda alternatives, and kombuchas, to help you find a product that best fits your dietary needs, budget constraints, and beverage cravings.
Here are our picks of the best nonalcoholic brands, beverages, and mixers.

What is a nonalcoholic beverage?
In the United States, a nonalcoholic beverage is one that contains less than 0.5% alcohol by volume (ABV) ( 1 ).
However, the umbrella of nonalcoholic beverages is large, encompassing water and juice products as well as  alcohol-free beer  and wine.
When purchasing a nonalcoholic beverage, it’s important to be aware that some products, such as kombucha, are made using fermentation and may still contain very small amounts of alcohol.
Similarly, some nonalcoholic beers and wines are  dealcoholized , meaning manufacturers make them in the same way as traditional beer and wine and then remove almost all the ethanol (alcohol) ( 1 ).
Keep in mind that while 0.5% or less ABV is considered a trace amount of alcohol, people who wish to avoid alcohol completely may want to select a beverage that is made without the production of alcohol.

How we chose
We considered the following factors when choosing these nonalcoholic beverages:
Nutritional content:  We looked for products with less than 15 grams (g) of added sugar per serving (bonus points to those with even less) and prioritized beverages that contain few or no artificial additives and preservatives.
Taste:  We know that taste is subjective. We considered how closely each beverage mimicked its alcoholic counterpart, whether the flavor profile was unique or complex, and, most importantly, whether we wanted to keep drinking it after the first couple of sips.
Price:  We included options to suit a range of budgets, from budget-friendly picks to more expensive, gift-worthy bottles.
Availability:  All the products below are available within the United States. We tried to include several options that you’re likely to find at a liquor store or an online retailer, such as Amazon, though some may be available only directly from the company.
Brand reputation:  All the brands were vetted to ensure that they align with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being. You can read more about  our vetting process .
General price ranges with dollar signs ($–$$$) are indicated below. One dollar sign means the product is rather affordable, whereas three dollar signs indicate a higher cost.
Generally, prices range from $0.09 to $1.50 per fluid ounce, though this may vary depending on the container size, where you shop, and whether you’re getting a multipack deal.
Pricing guide
$  = under $0.20 per fluid ounce
$$  = $0.20–$0.75 per fluid ounce
$$$  = over $0.75 per fluid ounce

Price:  $$–$$$
Our favorite products:  Amaretti, Coffee Originale, Spiced Cane Spirit, Amalfi Spritz Premix, and G&T Premix
Who it’s best for:  people looking to make alcohol-free or low alcohol versions of classic cocktails
Whether you’re looking to make a zero-proof version of your favorite cocktail or you want a premixed drink,  Lyre’s has you covered .
“While there are many esoteric brands on the market with truly unique flavor profiles, we stuck to the classics,” explained Carlos.
“If you are a rum drinker, we have three expressions for you. If you love gin, we have two for you. This way consumers and bartenders alike can take their favorite drinks and substitute Lyre’s to make that same cocktail in nonalcoholic form.”
During testing, we found all this to be true. From whipping up espresso martinis using Lyre’s Coffee Originale to shaking amaretto sours using their Amaretti, we were blown away by how closely Lyre’s spirits replicated the complexity of our favorite cocktails.
Lyre’s currently offers more than 17 spirits for mixing, 5 premixed beverages, and a celebratory bottle of bubbly. You can also purchase cocktail sets, which make great gifts.
Serving suggestion:  When you purchase a bottle of Lyre’s, you’ll get a QR code that provides access to a library of 36 drink recipes. We recommend trying the espresso martini or one of the sours.

Who it’s best for:  people who prefer drinks with strong herbal notes
Speaking of unique flavors, if you’re looking for an herbaceous beverage, then you’ll want to try Seedlip Garden 108.
Often considered the first nonalcoholic spirit company, Seedlip was born out of a desire to create a sophisticated nonalcoholic option derived from natural ingredients.
The company currently offers three spirits, but the Garden 108 is our favorite for gin fans.
Made with peas, hops, hay, rosemary, thyme, and  spearmint , the spirit adds a lovely complexity and freshness to more basic and complex drinks alike.
Seedlip Garden 108 is allergy-friendly, sugar-free, and calorie-free. It’s also sustainably packaged and arrives in a beautiful bottle that’s worthy of any beverage display shelf.
Serving suggestion:  We recommend sticking with the company’s suggestion of pouring 2 ounces (oz), or 59 milliliters (mL), into a glass with ice; adding a generous splash of ginger ale; and garnishing with a rosemary sprig.

Who it’s best for:  people who love gin and tonics and want a convenient premixed option
After trying numerous premixed zero-proof cocktails, we came back to Lyre’s, our pick for the best overall nonalcoholic spirit company.
Lyre’s currently offers five premixed cocktails, and while they’re all enjoyable to drink, the G&T is a clear standout.
Offering bold flavors of juniper and citrus and a dry finish, the Lyre’s G&T will have you believing you’re sipping on the real thing.
Each 8.5-oz (250-mL) can provides 64 calories and 12.8 g of sugar ( 2 ).
Just keep in mind that the product contains  quinine . While small amounts of quinine are likely safe during pregnancy, there are some concerns that higher amounts could have negative effects ( 3 ).
Therefore, people who are pregnant may feel more comfortable skipping this one. Instead, we recommend the Amalfi Spritz Premix as a satisfying alternative.
Serving suggestion:  We recommend pouring Lyre’s G&T into a glass with a large ice cube and garnishing with a lime wedge.

Our favorite products:  Sparkling Lemon Lime and Ginger Beer
Who it’s best for:  people looking for no-frills, low sugar mixers
Founded by actor and celebrity Blake Lively, Betty Buzz is your answer for tasty nonalcoholic mixers that aren’t packed with added sugar and artificial additives. Plus, the mixers come in adorable glass bottles.
Betty Buzz currently offers five flavors, all made with natural ingredients and free from artificial flavors,  sweeteners , and colors. They’re also gluten-free, non-GMO, kosher, and vegan-friendly.
Our favorite was the Betty Buzz Ginger Beer, which wasn’t cloying like most other ginger beers on the market. We also liked that its  ginger  flavor was bright and crisp without being overly spicy.
Depending on the flavor, Betty Buzz mixers contain 0–70 calories and 0–13 g of added sugar per 9-oz (266-mL) bottle ( 4 ).
Keep in mind that while one bottle is listed as a single serving, the company recommends using one bottle to craft two cocktails.
Serving suggestion:  We combined Betty Buzz Ginger Beer with Lyre’s Dark Cane Spirit and fresh lime juice for a nonalcoholic dark and stormy. To keep things simple, the Sparkling Grapefruit also makes for a great twist on a paloma when paired with lime juice and jalapeño slices.

Who it’s best for:  people looking for an alcohol-free sparkling rosé
Crafted with all-natural ingredients, TÖST Rosé is our pick if you want something bubbly that tastes sophisticated (and not like a grocery store bottle of sparkling cider).
This sparkling rosé is described as having a fruity nose and a dry, light finish, both of which we found to be true. Plus, unlike many other nonalcoholic sparkling wines, TÖST Rosé doesn’t taste like you’re just drinking carbonated fruit juice.
Instead, white tea, white cranberry, and  elderberry , ginger, and citrus extracts work together to create a soft yet crisp flavor that had us craving a second glass.
One 8-oz (240-mL) serving of TÖST Rosé provides 40 calories and 10 g of sugar ( 5 ).
Serving suggestion:  Keep it simple and (slowly) pour it into your favorite Champagne flute.

Our favorite products:  Run Wild IPA and Upside Dawn Golden
Who it’s best for:  people looking for a craft beer experience without the alcohol
Founded in 2017,  Athletic Brewing  has quickly become the leading producer of nonalcoholic craft beer in the United States ( 6 ).
Using a proprietary brewing method, all Athletic Brewing beers are fully fermented to less than 0.5% ABV rather than being dealcoholized later.
The company makes roughly 50 unique, nonalcoholic brews each year, ranging in style from hazy IPAs to a dark stout to a (very popular) golden ale. They also offer limited release beers, seasonal offerings, and small pilot batch brews.
Overall, our favorite is the Run Wild IPA, which has just the right balance of  hops  and refreshing citrus to keep us coming back for more.
While we didn’t get to test it, we’ve heard through the grapevine that the All Out Extra Dark is one of the best nonalcoholic stouts on the market. The company’s lineup also includes DayPack — a line of lightly hopped sparkling waters.
Nutrition stats vary by product, though most of the beers have fewer than 100 calories per serving. For example, a 12-oz (355-mL) can of the Run Wild IPA provides just 65 calories and 16 g of carbs ( 7 ).
Serving suggestion:  Assuming you’re drinking at home, we recommend pouring your Athletic Brewing beer of choice into a frosted mug.

Our favorite products:  Non-Alcoholic Juicy IPA and Non-Alcoholic Golden Lager
Who it’s best for:  people looking for flavor-packed nonalcoholic craft beers
This Colorado-based company first came on our radar for its nonalcoholic sparkling wines. However, it was  Grüvi’s nonalcoholic beers  that won us over.
The company currently offers six beers — two stouts, two IPAs, a wit, and a golden lager — along with one or two rotating seasonal flavors.
While the selection is more limited than Athletic Brewing’s and the products can be more difficult to  find , Grüvi’s beers were some of our favorites among the ones we tested.
In particular, the Juicy IPA was a pleasant, full-bodied surprise. Pineapple is the dominant flavor, though you also get notes of citrus and fig that help balance it out.
If you prefer a crushable beer that isn’t hoppy, you’ll want to try the Golden Lager. Considering that it won the Gold Medal for Non-Alcoholic Beer at the 2022 World Beer Cup Awards, it’s no surprise that this beer sells out fast.
Grüvi beers contain 80 or fewer calories per serving, depending on the flavor. The Juicy IPA, for example, provides 50 calories and 13 g of carbs per 12-oz (355-mL) can ( 8 ).
Serving suggestion:  Because these come in a can, we liked them best poured into a frosted mug.

Who it’s best for:  beer lovers looking for a simple nonalcoholic hefeweizen alternative
Produced by one of the oldest breweries in the world, Weihenstephaner Hefe Non-Alcoholic is our pick for the best no-frills wheat beer.
Not only is it relatively affordable and easy to find, but it also offers subtle banana and yeasty notes that you’d expect from a hefeweizen.
Plus, while many nonalcoholic beers come in cans, this beer is packaged in amber bottles and has a light  clove  aroma that will have your senses convinced you’re drinking the real thing.
One 12-oz (355-mL) bottle provides 75 calories ( 9 ).
Serving suggestion:  Keep this beverage no-frills by drinking it straight from the bottle.

Who it’s best for:  people who like the taste of hops but want a more refreshing alternative to a nonalcoholic beer
Recommended by Healthline Senior Editor Lisa Valente, MS, RD, this IPA-inspired sparkling beverage is perfect for sipping on a hot day.
More reminiscent of a seltzer than beer, the Hoppy Refresher features a floral and citrus flavor along with a hoppy finish for a truly refreshing experience.
Plus, it’s a good option if you’re watching your calories or carbs. Each 12-oz (355-mL) bottle is calorie-, carb-, and sugar-free ( 10 ).
Serving suggestion:  Lagunitas Hop Non-Alcoholic Hoppy Refresher is delicious on its own, though it also makes for a great shandy. Simply combine a bottle with muddled raspberries or strawberries and a splash or two of homemade lemonade.

Our favorite products:  Bubbly Rose, Pomegranate, Ginger Lemon, and Holiday Cheers
Who it’s best for:  people looking for a sweet, slightly tart beverage they can buy at the grocery store
With countless  kombucha  brands on the market, it’s hard to definitively say which one is the best. However, Health-Ade is our favorite option if you’re looking for a substitute for a sparkling cocktail.
While some flavors are higher in added sugar than others, we liked that the ingredient lists were minimal and included certified organic ingredients. Plus, all the flavors are vegan-friendly, gluten-free, and non-GMO.
Bubbly Rose, Pomegranate, and Ginger Lemon are among our favorite flavors. Holiday Cheers is a lightly spiced seasonal variety that’s also worth trying.
One 16-oz (473-mL) bottle of Pomegranate provides 80 calories and 12 g of added sugar ( 11 ).
Serving suggestion:  Health-Ade kombucha is delicious on its own or in a glass with a sprig of fresh mint or  rosemary . We also like mixing it with Topo Chico for a lower sugar alternative.

Our favorite products:  Pineapple, Cucumber, and Lime
Who it’s best for:  people looking for more flavorful — and less artificial-tasting — sparkling water option
Sparkling water doesn’t sound all that exciting, but with Spindrift it actually can be.
Unlike many other popular  sparkling water  brands that simply use “natural flavorings,” Spindrift uses real fruit juice, which results in a less artificial-tasting beverage.
The company currently offers 13 flavors, all of which are non-GMO certified and free of gluten and added sugar.
Nutritional stats for Spindrift vary by flavor, though all flavors are low in calories and sugar. For example, one 12-oz (255-mL) can of Spindrift Pineapple provides 15 calories and 3 g of sugar ( 12 ).
Serving suggestion:  Spindrift sparkling waters can be enjoyed on their own — we think they taste best poured into a glass — but for a more mocktail-like feel, we recommend adding a sprig of mint or a few slices of fresh (or frozen) fruit.

Price:  $$
Who it’s best for:  people looking to add carbonation to their mixed drinks
If you’re looking to whip up a nonalcoholic cocktail, there’s a good chance you’ll need to add some carbonation to the mix.
While there is an overwhelming number of sparkling waters on the market, Topo Chico offers an unparalleled crisp, clean flavor.
Plus, we found that it doesn’t seem to go flat as quickly as other brands, so you don’t have to worry about downing your zero-proof beverage too quickly.
Packaged in glass bottles, Topo Chico is a sparkling  mineral water  that has been bottled at the source in Monterrey, Mexico, since 1895.
Each 12-oz (355-mL) bottle is calorie-, carb-, and sugar-free ( 13 ).
Serving suggestion:  Topo Chico works great in a zero-proof mojito. Simply muddle sugar, fresh mint leaves, and a few lime wedges in a tall glass. Top with Topo Chico and ice.

How to choose a zero-proof beverage
The world of nonalcoholic beverages is growing rapidly. And while it’s an exciting development for nondrinkers and drinkers alike, it also makes things more confusing when you’re deciding which products to buy.
Here are a few factors to consider when shopping for your next zero-proof beverage:
Intended use:  The first step is figuring out what type of nonalcoholic beverage you want to buy. Are you looking for a celebratory bottle of bubbly, or do you want a mixer for crafting zero-proof twists on your favorite cocktails?
Flavor profile:  Just like alcoholic products, nonalcoholic beverages are crafted with a wide variety of herbs, aromatics, spices, fruits, and other extracts to create a unique flavor profile. Check the ingredient list to ensure that a product offers the flavors you’re craving.
Ingredients:  Check the ingredient list for any items you wish to avoid, such as artificial additives. Additionally, some herbal ingredients are  not safe during pregnancy  or may interact with certain medications.
Alcohol content:  While nonalcoholic beverages contain less than 0.5% ABV, some people may feel more comfortable with a fully alcohol-free product.
Nutrition profile:  Especially if you plan on drinking the beverage on a regular basis, consider choosing a product that’s low in  added sugar . Depending on your dietary needs, you may also want to select a product that’s low in calories or carbs.
Availability:  While many companies ship throughout the United States, it’s important to double-check that your beverage of choice is available in your area. Many companies also offer store locator tools on their websites to help you see whether their products are available near you.
Price:  Nonalcoholic beverages vary greatly in price. If you’re purchasing them online, be sure to factor in the cost of shipping when determining whether a product fits your budget.
Trial and error:  The only way to know whether you like something is to try it. When you’re purchasing a nonalcoholic spirit or mixer, it may take some trial and error to figure out the best way to incorporate it into your favorite drinks.

What are the benefits of not drinking alcohol?
Previous studies concluded that drinking in moderation posed little risk to overall health. However, more recent research suggests that there might not be a  “safe” amount of alcohol  after all because of alcohol’s negative effects on brain health ( 14 ,  15 ).
While more research is needed, potential benefits of reducing or stopping alcohol consumption include ( 16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  19 ,  20 ,  21 ,  22 ):
better sleep
weight loss
clearer skin
improved mental health
reduced risk of certain forms of cancer and chronic diseases
Overall, because alcohol affects nearly  every system in your body , not drinking can be a meaningful step toward whole-body health.
Because the umbrella of nonalcoholic beverages includes a wide variety of products, it’s hard to definitively say whether nonalcoholic beverages are universally healthier than alcoholic ones.
For example,  soda  is technically alcohol-free, but, because of its high added sugar content, soda consumption has been linked to an increased risk of chronic conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes ( 23 ).
However, nonalcoholic beverages that are low in added sugar and made from natural ingredients may be a healthier alternative to their alcoholic counterparts simply because they help reduce your consumption of alcohol.
Still, whether you’re  pregnant , the designated driver for the evening, participating in Dry January, or simply wanting to forgo alcohol, keep in mind that nonalcoholic products are not necessarily free of potentially problematic ingredients.
Especially if you’re pregnant or are taking prescription medications, it’s always a good idea to carefully read ingredient lists.
Many nonalcoholic beverages contain herbs or other active ingredients, such as adaptogens, that could interact with medications or may not be safe during pregnancy.
If you’re unsure whether an ingredient is safe for you to consume, it’s best to consult a trusted healthcare professional before taking a sip.
If you start delving into the world of nonalcoholic beverages, chances are you’ll stumble across the word “adaptogens.”
Adaptogens  are plant-based extracts that have been found to help manage stress. While there is research to support their benefits, they aren’t a one-size-fits-all solution ( 24 ,  25 ).
In fact, adaptogens seem to function differently in different people. Additionally, many adaptogens can interact with prescription medications, and some, such as ashwagandha, are likely unsafe during pregnancy ( 26 ).
While some nonalcoholic beverage companies make it clear that their products contain adaptogens, others do not.
Always make sure to read ingredient lists carefully and talk with a healthcare professional about any concerns you might have.

How we tested
We broke down our testing into phases based on the beverage category: spirits and mixers (including single-serve cocktails in a can), beers, wines, and other, which included drinks such as kombucha and flavored sparkling water.
Generally speaking, nonalcoholic spirits are not designed to be consumed straight up. Instead, they’re typically crafted to provide layers of flavor that, when combined with traditional cocktail mixers, create a cocktail-like experience.
Because of this, we tested nonalcoholic spirits using recipes featured on the brands’ websites.
Healthline Nutrition Market Editor Kelli McGrane, MS, RD, tested all the products, and we also sourced opinions from alcohol and non-alcohol industry experts, bartenders, family members, friends, and other Healthline editors.
In addition to passing our taste test, every brand and product was thoroughly vetted by our team of medical experts.

Frequently asked questions
According to the Food and Drug Administration, a beverage that is labeled “alcohol-free” should not contain any traceable amounts of alcohol, whereas a nonalcoholic product is one that contains less than 0.5% ABV ( 1 ).
Yes,  bitters  typically contain alcohol. However, the amount of alcohol in a bottle of bitters varies by brand. Furthermore, because bitters are typically used in such small amounts, it’s hard to estimate the amount of alcohol that they add to a drink.
Some companies are starting to roll out alcohol-free bitters, which are a good alternative if you’re looking to avoid alcohol completely.
Yes, because kombucha is produced using fermentation, it does contain some alcohol. However, the  amount of alcohol  varies greatly.
Studies show that kombucha can contain anywhere from less than 0.5% ABV to more than 3% ABV, depending on when the manufacturer stops the fermentation process ( 27 ,  28 ).

The bottom line
Gone are the days of settling for a soda and lime at the bar.
Whether you’re looking to reduce your alcohol intake or you’re abstaining completely, countless products are now available to help you craft a sophisticated (or basic) zero-proof cocktail.
You can start shopping online or in person for alcohol-free spirits and mixers or nonalcoholic beers and wines to shake up your happy hour routine.
