Title: Angelica Root: Benefits, Uses, and Side Effects

Angelica  is a genus of plants and herbs that’s often used in traditional medicine, particularly in Asian countries. The roots of many species of  Angelica  are used to make herbal medicines.
However, angelica root typically refers to the species  Angelica archangelica  ( A. archangelica ). It may also refer to  Angelica sinensis  ( A. sinensis ).
The roots and other parts of both of these plants have a long history of use in traditional and herbal medicine, although  A. sinensis  has been more thoroughly researched.
A. sinensis  is used in traditional Chinese medicine for various purposes, including hormonal balance, digestive support, and liver detoxification.
On the other hand,  A. archangelica  is traditionally used in European countries for digestive problems, circulation issues, and anxiety.
Still, there’s little scientific evidence to support many of these uses for either type.
This article reviews what angelica root is, the differences between  A. archangelica  and  A. sinensis , how they’re used, their benefits and downsides, and typical dosage.

What is angelica root?
Plants in the  Angelica  genus grow up to 10 feet (3 meters) tall and have globe-like clusters of green or yellow flowers that blossom into small yellow fruits.
They also tend to have a strong, unique smell due to the aromatic compounds they contain. The scent is often described as musky, earthy, or herbaceous ( 1 ).
A. sinensis  is known by a variety of names, including dong quai and female ginseng. It’s native to China and other countries in East Asia, where it’s used primarily in traditional medicine to treat female hormonal issues.
On the other hand,  A. archangelica  is commonly known as wild celery or Norwegian angelica. This type grows mainly in European countries, where it’s used in certain culinary applications or as an herbal medicine.
Although the name angelica root implies that just the root is used, most  A. archangelica  supplements and herbal medicine products contain the root, seeds, fruits, and/or flowers of the plant.  A. sinensis  products are typically only made with the root of the plant.
A. sinensis  and  A. archangelica  are related, but typically only the root of the  A. sinensis  plant is used in herbal medicine, while the entire  A. archangelica  plant is used.

How they’re used
Angelica root, particularly  A. archangelica , has some culinary uses. It’s sometimes used in the production of  gin and other spirits , and the leaves can be candied to use as a garnish or decoration.
However, it’s primarily used as an herbal remedy. It has a long history of use as a traditional medicine in Europe and Russia, where it grows wild.
Similarly,  A. sinensis  root is used in traditional Chinese medicine, primarily for women’s health purposes ( 2 ).
A. sinensis  is used for women’s health issues in traditional Chinese medicine, whereas  A. archangelica  is utilized in certain parts of Europe as an herbal remedy and for making spirits.

Benefits
Overall, there’s very little scientific evidence regarding the benefits of angelica root — neither  A. sinensis  nor  A. archangelica .
It’s thought that most of the potential benefits of  A. sinensis  come from ligustilide, a powerful compound that comprises approximately 1% of the plant and provides much of its strong fragrance ( 1 ,  3 ,  4 ).
In animal and test-tube studies,  A. sinensis  extract kills glioblastoma cells, which is a form of aggressive brain cancer ( 5 ,  6 ).
However, this does not mean that taking an angelica root supplement can kill  brain cancer  in humans. In fact, this is unlikely, and much more research in humans is needed before  A. sinensis  can be considered a potential cancer treatment.
Although these findings are a promising starting point for future research, you should follow the advice of your healthcare team if you have cancer.
A. sinensis  may promote  wound healing  by encouraging angiogenesis, or the creation of new blood vessels ( 7 ,  8 ).
There’s also some early evidence that it can specifically promote the healing of diabetic foot wounds. These can be more severe and slower to heal than other wounds due to the blood vessel and tissue damage that high blood sugar levels cause ( 9 ).
One of the most common uses of  A. sinensis , especially in traditional Chinese medicine, is the management of  menopausal symptoms  and other female hormonal issues ( 10 ).
Complementary therapies are also growing in popularity, as more people seek out natural options for menopause symptoms like hot flashes or night sweats ( 11 ).
Some evidence suggests that decreasing levels of serotonin in the body can contribute to menopausal hot flashes, and angelica root may help maintain or increase circulating levels of serotonin — thereby reducing the severity and frequency of hot flashes ( 12 ).
Still, there’s very little high quality evidence to support the use of  A. sinensis  for menopause symptoms, nor any long-term evidence of its safety in menopausal women ( 13 ,  14 ).
A. sinensis  may provide protection against both  osteoarthritis , or joint “wear and tear,” as well as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an inflammatory, autoimmune condition of the joints.
Supplementing with  A. sinensis  may decrease inflammation, prevent further joint damage, and promote cartilage repair in osteoarthritis ( 15 ).
Regarding RA,  A. sinensis  may decrease the inflammatory response, reducing pain and improving some of its other symptoms ( 16 ).
However, these studies were conducted in test-tube and animal models, so more research is needed.
A. archangelica  may also offer some benefits, but little research has been done on this herb. Additionally, most of the existing research was conducted in test-tube and animal studies, which can only serve as promising starting points for future human studies.
In test-tube and animal studies,  A. archangelica  — like  A. sinensis  — shows some promising anticancer and anti-tumor effects.
For example, it has been found to kill breast cancer cells in test tubes and inhibit tumor growth in mice. It may have similar effects on  cervical cancer , larynx cancer, and rhabdomyosarcoma cells ( 17 ,  18 ,  19 ).
These effects are thought to come from angelicin and imperatorin, two powerful phytochemicals found in  A. archangelica  ( 17 ,  18 ,  19 ).
However, this research is insufficient to prove that  A. archangelica  can provide anticancer or anti-tumor benefits in humans. More studies are needed. You should follow the treatment plan recommended by your healthcare team if you have cancer.
A. archangelica  may also kill harmful bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
In test-tube studies,  A. archangelica   essential oil  can kill disease-causing bacteria like  Staphylococcus aureus  and  Escherichia coli  ( 20 ).
A. archangelica  extract and some isolated compounds from it, including imperatorin, also exhibit antiviral activity against the herpes simplex (cold sore) virus and coxsackievirus, which causes digestive illness ( 21 ).
A. archangelica  essential oil also shows promise as a potential food-safe preservative to inhibit mold growth, as it can kill mold that grows on walnuts ( 22 ).
Finally, there’s some compelling evidence from animal studies that  A. archangelica  may  help reduce anxiety .
Three rat studies noted that  A. archangelica  extract induced relaxation and decreased anxious behaviors in the animals ( 23 ,  24 ,  25 ).
However, these studies haven’t been replicated in humans, so it’s difficult to know whether it’d exert the same effects in people. Human studies are needed.
A. sinensis  offers potential benefits for wound healing, menopause, and arthritis.  A. archangelica  may provide anti-anxiety and antimicrobial benefits. Both types can kill certain cancer cells in test-tube studies, but more research in humans is needed.

Downsides
Angelica root, particularly  A. sinensis , has known side effects and may cause some drug interactions. While  A. archangelica  may likewise have some potential side effects, it has not been studied as much as  A. sinensis .
There have been suspected cases of high dose  A. sinensis  supplements causing heart problems.  A. sinensis  may also increase your blood pressure ( 26 ,  27 ).
A. sinensis  may likewise interact with  blood thinners  like warfarin, possibly causing dangerous and potentially fatal bleeding in certain instances. If you’re taking a blood thinner, you should not use  A. sinensis  without first clearing it with your healthcare provider ( 28 ,  29 ,  30 ).
Additionally, members of the  Angelica  genus contain furanocoumarins, which are the same compounds in grapefruit that may interact with many drugs, including certain cholesterol and anti-seizure medications ( 31 ).
Talk to your healthcare provider before supplementing with any type of  Angelica  if you’re taking prescription medications that carry a grapefruit warning.
Furthermore, know that photodermatitis, which is an abnormal skin response to ultraviolet (UV) rays, and contact dermatitis are also a concern when handling the angelica plant ( 32 ).
Finally, due to a lack of evidence regarding their safety in pregnant and breastfeeding women, you should avoid taking  A. archangelica  and  A. sinensis  if you’re pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or breastfeeding ( 33 ).
A. sinensis  may increase your blood pressure, cause heart problems, and interact with blood thinners. Additionally, plants in the  Angelica  genus may interact with drugs that carry a grapefruit warning.

Dosage and precautions
Angelica root supplements are sold in capsule and liquid extract form, as well as dried as a tea.
A standard dosage hasn’t been established, nor is it clear what a safe dose would be to avoid complications and potential side effects. Most angelica root supplements contain 500–2,000 mg of powdered angelica root or angelica root extract per serving.
If you’re taking a blood thinner or have preexisting heart problems or  high blood pressure , you should avoid  A. sinensis  unless your healthcare provider has recommended it to you.
What’s more, avoid self-treating a medical condition with an  Angelica -based supplement, as doing so may delay professional care and have serious consequences.
Be sure to consult your healthcare professional before considering it for any health purpose.
Ensure that the product you purchase contains the type of  Angelica  that you’re looking for and aligns with your desired effects from supplementation.
Many supplements called angelica root or angelica don’t specify which type they’re made with.
As a general rule of thumb, dong quai supplements are made with  A. sinensis , and angelica root supplements are made with  A. archangelica .
However, some  A. sinensis  supplements are also called angelica root. To avoid confusion, only purchase a product that discloses what species of  Angelica  it contains.
A standard dosage hasn’t been established. Most angelica root supplements contain 500–2,000 mg of powdered angelica root or angelica root extract per serving. Also, check that the species of  Angelica  used in the supplement is disclosed on the label.

The bottom line
Angelica root is a popular herbal medicine that has been historically used in parts of Europe and East Asia. Angelica root can refer to either  A. archangelica  or  A. sinensis .
Although each has a wealth of reported uses, there’s very little evidence to support any of them, and most of the existing evidence comes from animal and test-tube studies.
If you’re interested in taking angelica root, check to make sure that the supplement you purchase is the species of angelica root you’re seeking.
