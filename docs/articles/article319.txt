Title: 19 Foods and Drinks That Help with Bloating

Many foods have been shown to help with bloating by promoting regularity, preventing fluid retention, and enhancing gut health.
Bloating is a  common  problem often caused by  constipation  or excess  gas .
What you eat and drink can significantly affect bloating and other digestive issues. Here are 19 foods and drinks that can help with bloating.

What should I eat if I’m bloated?
Avocados are  highly nutritious , packing a  good amount  of  folate  and vitamins C and K into each serving.
They’re also rich in  potassium , an essential mineral involved in regulating fluid balance and  sodium  levels to prevent water retention.
What’s more, they’re  high in fiber , which  moves  slowly through your digestive tract to support regularity and help prevent constipation and bloating.
Cucumbers  are composed of about  95% water.  Eating  foods with a high water content  can help ensure you stay hydrated and meet your daily fluid needs.
This  may prevent  water retention and alleviate bloating caused by dehydration.
Yogurt is packed with probiotics, beneficial bacteria that play a key role in gut health.
According to  research , probiotics may improve stool frequency and consistency to  promote regularity .
Furthermore, probiotics  have been shown  to reduce bloating and abdominal distension caused by conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common disorder that affects the large intestine.
Berries like  strawberries ,  blueberries , and  blackberries  contain antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals.
They’re also high in fiber.  Blackberries , for instance, contain nearly  8 grams (g) of fiber per cup (150 g) .
Increasing your fiber intake  can enhance gut health and soften your stool to prevent constipation and bloating.
Green tea  is a great option to help you stay hydrated and prevent fluid retention.
It’s brimming with antioxidants like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which can neutralize harmful  free radicals  and reduce inflammation.
It also contains  caffeine , which stimulates digestive tract movement and acts as a  natural laxative  to support regularity. This means that  coffee can help reduce bloating .
Celery  is a nutritious veggie comprising about  95% water .
In addition to its high water content, celery contains mannitol, a type of  sugar alcohol  that  softens  stools to promote regularity by pulling water into the digestive tract.
Additionally, the root of the vegetable is considered a  natural diuretic . This means it increases urine production to remove excess water and sodium from your body, which can help alleviate bloating.
Ginger  is an herb known for its ability to soothe digestive distress.
For example,  research  shows that ginger could speed up stomach emptying to prevent bloating and feelings of fullness.
Kombucha  is a fermented beverage typically made from black or green tea.
Like other  fermented foods , it’s  rich in probiotics  and can promote gut health and regularity.
It  can also keep you  hydrated and squeeze more inflammation-fighting antioxidants into your daily diet to help beat bloating.
That said, kombucha is a carbonated beverage, so drinking too much may cause digestive distress, including bloating.
Bananas are popular for their flavor, portability, and convenience.
They’re also highly nutritious and an excellent source of fiber, with  3 g of fiber found in 1 medium (118 g)  banana.
Additionally, they’re  rich in potassium , a nutrient that supports a healthy fluid balance. In turn, this  may prevent  bloating and water retention.
Papaya is a type of tropical fruit known for its sweet flavor and smooth, creamy texture.
It not only has a high water content but also  provides   plenty of fiber  in each serving.
It likewise contains an enzyme called  papain , which helps your body break down  amino acids . This encourages  healthy digestion  and  may help  keep bloating at bay.
Asparagus is a  great source of fiber , providing nearly  3 g in each cup (134 g) serving.
It also contains a good amount of  inulin , a  prebiotic fiber  found in various foods.
Studies  show that inulin may support gut health and increase regularity, which may help prevent bloating and constipation.
Enjoying a bowl of  oatmeal  in the morning can be an easy and effective way to battle bloating.
That’s because oats are loaded with fiber, boasting  4 g in each 1/2-cup (40 g) serving.
Plus, they contain a specific type of fiber called  beta glucan , which has  powerful anti-inflammatory properties.
Pineapple is a tropical fruit that  packs  a serious punch in nutrition, with plenty of vitamin C,  manganese , and B vitamins in every serving.
Pineapple also contains  bromelain , an enzyme that has long been used in traditional medicine to treat digestive disorders.
In  some studies , bromelain has been shown to  fight inflammation , which improves issues like bloating and swelling.
Turmeric is often used to brighten curries, soups, and side dishes.
It contains a compound called  curcumin , which has been studied extensively for its anti-inflammatory effects.
According to  some research , curcumin may help  improve gut health  and reduce symptoms of IBS, including gas, bloating, and constipation.
If you experience  bloating after eating  foods like pasta, crackers, and bread, switching to gluten-free grains like  quinoa  may be worth a try.
Consuming  gluten-containing foods  can cause digestive issues like bloating among people with  celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity .
Quinoa is also  rich  in other beneficial compounds like fiber and antioxidants that  help combat  bloating — even if you’re not on a gluten-free diet.
Although it’s often added to sweets like pies, cakes, and crisps,  rhubarb  is not a fruit. Rather, it’s a vegetable known for its vibrant edible stalks.
Rhubarb  contains a compound called sennoside, which inhibits water transport from the luminal to the vascular side of the colon,  acting  as a natural laxative to stimulate bowel movements.
Furthermore, it can help increase your fiber intake, with over  2 g of fiber in each cup (122 g) of rhubarb stalk .
Kiwi  is a popular fruit rich in several key nutrients, including fiber and potassium.
It also contains actinidin, an  enzyme  that may help improve digestion and  speed up  stomach emptying.
As such, kiwi  may help reduce  digestive symptoms like bloating,  stomach pain , and constipation.
Peppermint tea  is  an herbal tea  that’s widely used to treat a range of digestive conditions.
Peppermint oil , in particular, has been shown to decrease inflammation and treat symptoms of IBS like stomach pain, constipation, and bloating. Plus, it  may help  prevent  muscle spasms  in the stomach and intestines, which could also help prevent bloating.
That said, more research is needed to confirm whether the  benefits of peppermint oil  also apply to peppermint tea.
Closely related to vegetables like  carrots , celery, and  parsley , fennel is known for its distinctive licorice-like flavor.
Interestingly,  fennel and its seeds  possess antispasmodic properties, meaning they  can help relax  the muscles in your intestinal tract to provide relief from gas and bloating.

What foods make bloating worse?

Other ways to prevent bloating
In addition to incorporating some of the foods and drinks listed above into your daily diet, several other strategies can help prevent bloating.
Eat and chew slowly:  This  can help reduce  how much air you swallow to prevent gas buildup.
Take supplements:   Probiotics or digestive enzymes  may help reduce digestive discomfort.
Track your food:  This can help you identify whether certain foods are causing your digestive issues. For example, foods high in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols ( FODMAPs ) — such as beans, dairy products, and garlic — can trigger  digestive symptoms like gas and bloating in some people.
Get enough sleep and exercise regularly:  Both  sleep deprivation  and  physical inactivity  can affect  digestive health  and worsen issues like bloating.
Lastly, you may also consider consulting a doctor to determine whether you have any food sensitivities or other underlying conditions that could contribute to bloating, such as IBS.

The bottom line
Bloating  is a common issue that can be caused by a number of conditions.
Many foods and drinks may help decrease bloating by reducing constipation, alleviating inflammation, and supporting a healthy fluid balance.
Chewing your food thoroughly, taking certain supplements, and determining whether certain ingredients contribute to your digestive issues may also help relieve bloating.
If your symptoms are serious or persist, consider consulting a doctor for personalized recommendations and treatment.
