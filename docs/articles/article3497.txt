Smart scales measure multiple metrics of body composition — not just your weight.
Typically, they use bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), a noninvasive tool that evaluates your body composition by sending a weak electrical current through your body ( 1 ).
A snapshot of your body composition may be especially useful if you’re hoping to build muscle mass or decrease body fat. However, the large smart scales market makes it challenging to determine which products are worth their price tag.

Reasons to buy a smart scale
Some people may prefer to purchase a smart scale rather than a typical scale because smart scales measure several aspects of body composition beyond just weight.
In fact, some can measure body fat, muscle mass, or body water percentage, among other metrics.
Tech-savvy individuals may also prefer smart scales for the added convenience they offer. For example, many offer Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity, while others sync directly to your smartphone or connect to an app to track your progress over time.
Additionally, a smart scale may be a good option for families and larger households, because many models allow you to set up profiles for multiple users.

How to choose the best smart scale
There are a few key factors to consider when shopping for a smart scale.
For starters, you may want to determine which measures of body composition are most important to you. Some of the most commonly measured metrics are:
body weight
body fat percentage
bone mass
muscle mass
BMI
BMR
body water percentage
It’s also helpful to find a smart scale that works well with your favorite  fitness apps  and to determine whether it offers Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity.
Additionally, be sure to consider the price, power source, and maximum number of users.

A comparison of the best smart scales

How accurate are smart scales?
Though smart scales can be a useful tool to provide a general overview of your body composition, they may not be as accurate as other methods.
One study evaluated the reliability of BIA — the tool used by many smart scales — and found that its accuracy decreased with higher amounts of body fat ( 2 ).
Another test conducted by Consumer Reports compared the accuracy of six smart scales to the results obtained by a machine called the Bod Pod, a highly accurate device that tracks changes in air pressure to determine body fat percentage ( 3 ).
According to the test, the 6 smart scales were all fairly far off from the Bod Pod’s results — in some cases, by as much as 34%. This variability could possibly be attributed to differences in body shape, hydration status, and recent exercise ( 3 ).
Still, smart scales may be useful for tracking changes in body fat and providing a general snapshot of your overall body composition.

The flaws in measuring body fat with a scale
Besides the potential inaccuracies associated with smart scales, there are several other reasons why measuring your body fat with a scale may not be ideal.
Many factors can impact body fat measurements, including the time of day, the amount of food you’ve eaten, whether you’ve consumed alcohol recently, your body shape, and whether you are sweating ( 4 ).
Additionally, some manufacturers recommend avoiding  body fat scales  if you have a pacemaker or other internal medical device. Though some research suggests that smart scales may be safe for people with these devices, it’s best to talk with your doctor first ( 5 ,  6 ).
Furthermore, while a smart scale can provide a general estimate of how much body fat you have, it cannot determine exactly where the fat is located.
This is an important consideration when it comes to disease prevention, as higher amounts of stomach fat may be linked to a higher risk of heart disease ( 7 ).

Frequently asked questions
Smart scales may be worth considering for individuals who are interested in tracking and measuring multiple metrics of body composition.
Because many smart scales sync with a variety of health and fitness apps and allow multiple users to store their data, the additional convenience a smart scale offers may also be worth it for some people.
While Apple does not currently offer a scale of its own, the Withings Body+ and Withings Body Cardio smart scales are available on Apple’s website.
A smart scale can be useful if you are looking to measure multiple metrics of body composition or seeking a simple way to sync your data to your favorite health and fitness apps.
However, keep in mind that smart scales are often more expensive than a typical scale and can be time consuming to set up, so they may not be a good fit for everyone.

The bottom line
Smart scales can be a useful tool for measuring several metrics of  body composition .
When selecting a smart scale, consider which features it offers, as well as the price, power source, maximum number of users, and connectivity options.
