Title: 6 Surprising Health Benefits of Truffles



Black truffles are a flavorful fungus used in a variety of savory dishes. They are highly nutritious, rich in antioxidants, and full of other potential health benefits.
Truffles have gained widespread attention in the culinary world lately, becoming a favorite among chefs and food-lovers alike.
Not to be confused with the chocolate confectionery of the same name, truffles are a type of fungus that grows near the roots of certain trees.
There are many different types — such as black truffles, white truffles, summer truffles and garlic truffles — each with minute differences in flavor, appearance and price.
In addition to their strong flavor and pungent aroma, truffles are also highly nutritious and have been linked to a number of powerful health effects.
Here are 6 surprising health benefits of truffles.

1. Rich in Important Nutrients
Truffles boast an impressive nutrient profile and are high in many important vitamins and minerals.
In fact, they’re high in carbs, protein and fiber and contain both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, as well as  micronutrients , such as vitamin C, phosphorus, sodium, calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron ( 1 ).
Research also indicates that truffles may be a complete source of protein, providing all nine essential amino acids your body needs ( 1 ).
Keep in mind that the nutrient profile can vary between species. For example, studies show that white desert truffles are higher in protein, fat and fiber than other types, such as the black desert species ( 1 ).
Summary  Truffles are considered a complete source of protein and are  high in carbs, fiber and several micronutrients.

2. High in Antioxidants
Truffles are a great source of antioxidants, compounds that help fight free radicals and prevent oxidative damage to your cells.
Studies show that antioxidants are important to many aspects of your health and may even be linked to a lower risk of chronic conditions, such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes ( 2 ).
Though the exact amounts can vary between different species, truffles have been shown to contain  antioxidants  like vitamin C, lycopene, gallic acid and homogentisic acid ( 3 ).
Because of their antioxidant content, test-tube studies show that both black and white truffles may even help kill cancer cells and reduce inflammation ( 4 ).
Note that this study was performed using highly concentrated truffle extracts. Therefore, it remains unclear how the antioxidants in fresh truffles may affect your overall health.
Summary  Truffles are high in several important antioxidants, which may  help reduce your risk of chronic disease, decrease cancer cell growth and  reduce inflammation. However, more research is needed.

3. Has Antibacterial Properties
In addition to their stellar nutrient profile, truffles may also have antimicrobial properties that can help decrease the growth of specific strains of bacteria.
One test-tube study showed that extract from desert truffles inhibited the growth of  Staphylococcus aureus  by up to 66%. This bacteria can cause a wide range of illnesses in humans ( 5 ).
Similarly, another test-tube study observed that extract from the same variety decreased the growth of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , a strain of bacteria that is often highly resistant to  antibiotics  ( 6 ).
However, further research is needed to measure the antibacterial effects of other types of truffles and in amounts typically eaten.
Additionally, high-quality studies should be conducted to determine how the antibacterial properties of truffles may affect these bacterial infections in humans.
Summary  Some test-tube studies show that truffles can decrease the  growth of several strains of bacteria. However, human research is lacking.

4. May Help Kill Cancer Cells
Though evidence is currently limited to test-tube studies, some research suggests that truffles may possess powerful  anticancer properties .
For example, one test-tube study showed that compounds extracted from different types of truffles helped block the growth of liver, lung, colon and breast tumor cells ( 7 ).
Another test-tube study found that extracts from both black and white species exhibited anticancer effects on cervical, breast and colon  cancer  cells ( 4 ).
However, additional studies are needed to evaluate how truffles may impact cancer growth in humans when eaten rather than in concentrated extract form.
Summary  Test-tube studies show that truffles may have anticancer  properties and could help block the growth of certain types of cancer cells.

5. May Help Reduce Inflammation
Inflammation is a vital part of your immune function that helps defend your body against infection and illness.
However, sustaining high levels of inflammation in the long term is thought to contribute to the development of chronic disease ( 8 ).
Some research suggests that truffles may help  relieve inflammation  and hence promote overall health and immunity.
One test-tube study showed that certain compounds in black and white species could block the activity of specific enzymes involved in the inflammatory process ( 4 ).
Other test-tube research has found that truffles may help fight free radical formation, which can reduce your risk of cell damage and inflammation ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ).
Still, more research is needed to understand how eating normal amounts of truffles may influence levels of inflammation in humans.
Summary  Several test-tube studies show that truffles can help reduce  inflammation to promote overall health. Still, more studies in humans are  needed.

6. Easy to Add to Your Diet
Once considered a pricey delicacy reserved for gourmet dishes, there are now plenty of ways to add truffles to your diet without having to empty your bank account.
Widely available at specialty markets and online retailers, black truffles are one of the most common varieties and much more affordable than other types, such as the white variety.
While each ounce (28 grams) comes with a hefty price tag, it only takes a small amount to transform your dish.
Try topping salads, soups or main courses with a few shavings for a flavorful, aroma-packed garnish.
Alternatively, you can mix a bit of truffle into  olive oil  or room temperature butter to use in your favorite recipes for a tasty twist.
The delicacy also works well in sauces, pasta, risottos and meat or seafood dishes.
Summary  Truffles can be used in small amounts in a variety of recipes  for a bit of added flavor and aroma. They can also be mixed into butter or  olive oil and drizzled over dishes.

The Bottom Line
Truffles are a type of flavorful fungus commonly used in a variety of dishes.
In addition to their distinct taste and aroma, truffles are also highly nutritious, rich in antioxidants and may possess antibacterial, anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties.
Still, current research is mostly limited to test-tube studies using concentrated truffle extracts, so it’s unclear how these beneficial properties may impact your health.
That being said, a small amount can go a long way, so be sure to pair them with a range of other healthy ingredients to maximize their potential benefits.
