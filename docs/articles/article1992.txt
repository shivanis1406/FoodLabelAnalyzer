Title: The 8 Best Natural Energy Drinks, According to a Dietitian

Many people rely on energy drinks for a much-needed pick-me-up to power them through the day.
But most popular energy drinks are loaded with added sugar — many with even more than a soda. Some also contain artificial colors and sweeteners, which you may prefer to avoid, and pack large amounts of caffeine, which may leave you feeling jittery, anxious, or agitated ( 1 ).
Note that both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the European Food Safety Authority consider a daily intake of up to 400 mg of caffeine to be safe ( 2 ).
All the same, several brands make healthy, naturally derived energy drinks that can give you the boost you’re looking for without the side effects.

A quick look at our picks of the best natural energy drinks

What are natural energy drinks?
Unlike most other energy beverages, natural energy drinks don’t contain ingredients such as artificial sweeteners or synthetic colorings, which some people prefer to leave out of their diets.
They’re made with naturally derived ingredients like green tea, yerba mate, and botanical extracts.
Additionally, the energy drinks on this list do not contain added sugars, which can harm health if consumed in high amounts ( 3 ).

Benefits
Energy drinks that contain ingredients like green tea, coffee, and guarana can help provide a quick boost of energy when you’re feeling fatigued. Sipping on an energy drink can help you feel more alert and may even improve your mood ( 4 ).
Some people use energy drinks to enhance athletic performance or to boost concentration and memory at work or school ( 5 ).
While you may occasionally use an energy drink to help minimize the effects of fatigue or improve athletic performance, it’s not a good idea to use energy drinks regularly or to rely on them to get you through your day.
Energy drinks can’t take the place of getting enough sleep, eating a nutritious diet, managing stress, and addressing underlying health issues that may be causing prolonged, unexplained fatigue.

Risks and side effects
Drinking energy drinks that contain large amounts of stimulants can lead to adverse side effects.
For example, a 2021 review found that the most commonly reported side effects of energy drink consumption in teens and adults were insomnia, stress, restlessness, and mood changes.
T he authors recommend limiting energy drink consumption and state that 5–7 energy drinks per week may be too many ( 6 ).
What’s more, energy drink overconsumption has been linked to dangerous medical issues such as seizures, coma, liver injury, and heart arrhythmias ( 7 ,  8 ).
They have even been linked to some deaths ( 9 ,  10 ).
Energy drinks should not be an everyday part of your diet, nor should they be consumed in excess. It’s important to limit your intake of stimulants like caffeine in order to reduce the chances of adverse side effects such as insomnia and jitteriness.
The natural energy drinks on this list contain less than 200 mg per serving, which is the amount found in about one 12-ounce (360-mL) cup of coffee, so they’re unlikely to cause adverse side effects when consumed in moderation ( 11 ).

A quick comparison

Other considerations
Although enjoying a caffeinated beverage on occasion is perfectly healthy, if you find yourself relying on energy drinks to get through your day, it’s worth considering other factors that may be zapping your stamina.
Lack of sleep, inadequate diet,  chronic stress , excessive exercise, and drug and alcohol use are just a few of the factors that may deplete your energy levels ( 32 ).
What’s more, health conditions such as anemia, sleep apnea, and diabetes, as well as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and other autoimmune conditions, may lead to fatigue.
If you’re experiencing  ongoing fatigue , it’s important to get to the root of the problem and avoid relying on energy-boosting supplements, medications, or energy drinks.
Consult a healthcare professional if you’re concerned about low energy levels.
Additionally, caffeinated drinks may not be appropriate for everyone. For example, teens, people with anxiety, and pregnant or breastfeeding people should limit their caffeine intake ( 33 ,  34 ,  35 ).
Many factors can lead to chronic fatigue. Talk with a healthcare professional if you find that you’re often relying on energy drinks.

How and when to drink natural energy drinks
While enjoying a natural energy drink here and there won’t harm your health, it’s important to keep your overall intake of stimulants, such as caffeine, below a certain level to avoid side effects like jitteriness and insomnia.
All the energy products on this list contain less than 140 mg of caffeine, which is much less than is found in a 12-ounce (360-mL) cup of coffee ( 11 ).
Keep in mind that consuming more than 400 mg of caffeine per day may lead to adverse side effects and is not recommended ( 36 ).
Regardless, some people are more sensitive to caffeine than others and may notice side effects such as jitteriness or experience insomnia even after consuming a relatively small amount of caffeine ( 37 ).
If you’re sensitive to caffeine, it’s not a good idea to consume energy drinks that contain a large amount of caffeine. In general, avoid consuming caffeinated beverages such as energy drinks later in the day, as they could impact sleep quality ( 38 ).

Frequently asked questions

Keep in mind that you can simply drink a cup of caffeinated tea or coffee if you’re looking for a natural way to boost your energy levels.
Natural energy drinks are free of artificial sweeteners and synthetic colorings. Instead, they contain naturally derived ingredients such as green tea, yerba mate, and botanical extracts.

Most of the energy drinks on this list use energizing ingredients such as green tea, matcha, coffee, yerba mate, and guarana.
These ingredients are all effective for improving short-term energy levels, so it depends on your personal preferences. For example, if you don’t like green tea, you can try a product that contains coffee or yerba mate instead.
Importantly, you should not rely on energy drinks for energy. If you’re experiencing prolonged fatigue even though you’re getting enough sleep, it’s important to check with a healthcare professional to rule out underlying health conditions.

The bottom line
If you’re looking for a natural energy boost, try one of the drinks listed above.
However, if you’re consistently relying on energy drinks to power through the day, it’s best to speak with a healthcare professional to find better ways to improve your energy levels.
