The ketogenic, or keto, diet is a high fat, very low carb diet originally developed to help individuals with epilepsy. It has since been linked to health benefits like weight loss and improved blood sugar control ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
To get the proposed benefits of the keto diet, you typically limit carbs to fewer than 50 grams per day ( 1 ).
While coffee itself is keto-friendly, many coffee creamers are not. They can be high in both sugar and carbs.
That doesn’t mean you have to drink your coffee black, though. Many keto-friendly coffee creamer options exist, which you can buy or make at home. The key is choosing a healthy option made with mostly whole ingredients.

How we chose the best keto coffee creamers
It can be hard to know what coffee creamers will fit on a keto diet. We chose the best keto coffee creamers based on the following criteria:
Taste and flavor.  We aimed to include a variety of sweetened, flavored, and unsweetened and unflavored varieties to meet different taste preferences.
Carbs.  All of the creamers on our list contain less than 3 grams of total carbs.
Cost.  The coffee creamers on our list vary in price to meet the needs of a range of budgets.
Vetting.  All the products on our list have been vetted to ensure they meet  Healthline’s business and medical standards .

This popular keto-friendly creamer is made with  medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil , ghee, coconut oil, cacao butter, and sunflower lecithin to create a creamy, high fat creamer to help promote ketosis.
MCTs are a type of saturated fat that has been shown to be better for ketone production and maintaining ketosis than long-chain fatty acids ( 4 ,  5 ).
Ketosis  is a metabolic state in which your body breaks down fat into molecules called ketones, which are used for energy when your glucose (sugar) supply is limited ( 6 ).
Plus, though more research is needed, it seems that MCT oil may aid with fat loss and exercise performance ( 7 ,  8 ).
One tablespoon (15 mL) of this creamer has 120 calories, 14 grams of fat, and 0 grams of carbs, sugar, and protein ( 9 ).
Since there aren’t any emulsifiers in this product, you’ll want to use a blender to combine it with your coffee. The company recommends mixing 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of the creamer and your brewed coffee in a blender or using a hand-held immersion blender.

Price:  $$ Available in four flavors, the original flavor of this keto coffee creamer is made with just three ingredients: virgin coconut oil, grass-fed ghee, and raw cacao powder. Raw  cacao powder  is made from unroasted cacao beans. It’s a rich source of magnesium, as well as flavonols, which are plant compounds with antioxidant properties ( 10 ,  11 ).
This acts as the only sweetener in this creamer, so there are no added sugars or artificial sweeteners. Magnesium has numerous  important functions  in the body and brain, including aiding muscle contractions, bone formation, and blood pressure regulation. Flavonols have been linked to improvements in brain and heart health ( 12 ,  13 ,  14 ). One tablespoon (15 mL) of the mocha flavor has 120 calories, 12 grams of fat, 0 grams of protein, 2 grams of carbs, and 0 grams of sugar ( 15 ).

Soy-free, dairy-free, and gluten-free, this plant-based coffee creamer is a good option for individuals with allergies or those who prefer to avoid dairy products.
Califia Farms’ creamer is also vegan-friendly, as it’s made from a base of unsweetened  almond milk  and coconut cream. Overall, the ingredient list is quite short and free from any added or artificial sweeteners.
While low in fat, with just 1.5 grams per 2 tablespoons (30 mL), it’s also one of the lowest calorie options, with just 15 calories per serving. This creamer doesn’t contain any sugar or carbs, so you don’t have to worry about it kicking you out of ketosis ( 16 ).

This powdered keto creamer comes in 7 different flavors, including unsweetened, and doesn’t have to be refrigerated. It’s also vegan-friendly, gluten-free, soy-free, and dairy-free.
Ingredient-wise, it’s free from sugar additives, artificial ingredients, sweeteners, and artificial colors. Instead, the creamer is made from just three ingredients — coconut milk powder, Aquamin, and extra virgin  coconut oil .
Aquamin is a multimineral supplement derived from sea algae. Since it is rich in calcium and magnesium, it may have benefits for bone health ( 17 ).
While research is limited, an animal study suggests that Aquamin may help promote bone formation and slow bone loss ( 17 ).
One tablespoon (6 grams) of the powder provides 40 calories, 3.5 grams of fat, 2 grams of carbs, 1 gram of sugar, and 0 grams of protein ( 18 ).
no refrigeration required
free from additives and artificial ingredients
limited research done on Aquamin

While not technically a coffee creamer,  heavy whipping cream  is high fat and low carb and can add a delicious richness to your morning cup of coffee.
Additionally, heavy whipping cream is a good source of many essential nutrients. It’s particularly high in vitamin A, which is important for eye health and a strong immune system ( 19 ,  20 ,  21 ).
However, some brands of whipping cream may contain a stabilizer, such as  carrageenan  (a seaweed extract for thickening), and an emulsifier, such as polysorbate 80.
Organic Valley Heavy Whipping Cream is made from just two ingredients: organic cream from pasture-raised cows and  gellan gum , a natural stabilizer. As a result, it’s free from artificial colors, preservatives, antibiotics, and synthetic hormones.
Just keep in mind that heavy whipping cream is quite high in calories. One tablespoon (15 mL) provides 50 calories, 6 grams of fat, and 0 grams of carbs and sugar ( 22 ).

For those who prefer coconut sugar, this keto-friendly coffee creamer contains just 1 gram of sugar.
It’s worth noting that this creamer does contain 3 grams of carbs, which may be higher than some people prefer on a keto diet. And if you prefer to avoid stevia extract as a sweetener, this does still contain some in addition to the coconut sugar.
It also contains MCTs, which are better for maintaining ketosis than long-chain fatty acids ( 4 ,  5 ).
One 2-teaspoon (5-gram) serving of the unsweetened flavor contains just 25 calories, 1.5 grams of fat, 3 grams of carbs, and 0 grams of sugar ( 24 ).

This keto creamer is sugar-free, lactose-free, and gluten-free.
It comes in 3 different flavors: original, vanilla, and sweet cream. Original is unsweetened, whereas the vanilla and sweet cream flavors are sweetened with a combination of monk fruit and stevia.
One 3-tablespoon (44-mL) serving of the original flavor contains 40 calories, 3.5 grams of fat, 0 grams of carbs and sugar, and 2 grams of protein ( 25 ).
Keep in mind the creamer may clump a bit when mixed into hot coffee, so you’ll want to blend it in.

Bulletproof Original Creamer is made with grass-fed butter, which has a better ratio of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids than regular butter ( 30 ).
This may help reduce the risk of cardiovascular and other chronic diseases ( 30 ).
This creamer comes in an original flavor, which is unsweetened, as well as hazelnut and vanilla flavors, which are sweetened with stevia.
As with many keto creamers, you’ll want to blend this one with your coffee or mix it in with a handheld frother.
One 1-scoop (14-gram) serving of the original flavor contains 100 calories, 10 grams of fat, and 3 grams of carbs ( 31 ).

Comparing keto coffee creamers

Homemade paleo and keto bulletproof coffee creamer
With just a few ingredients, it’s also possible to make your own keto-friendly option from scratch.
To make 6 servings, each 1/4 cup (60 mL), you need:
2/3 cups (160 mL) heavy cream
2/3 cups (160 mL) water
2 egg yolks
4–6 tbsp.  erythritol
2 tsp. (10 mL) vanilla extract
This recipe  for a homemade creamer takes just 15 minutes to cook, but it does need to be refrigerated overnight to thicken.
The egg yolks in this keto-friendly creamer contribute fat and protein and are one of the best dietary sources of choline ( 32 ).
While  choline  is only needed in small amounts, it’s an essential nutrient that supports many important functions, including brain health, nervous system function, and fat metabolism ( 33 ,  34 ).
The serving size of this homemade creamer is a generous 1/4 cup (60 mL) and has 114 calories, 11 grams of fat, less than 1 gram of carbs, and 1 gram of protein ( 35 ).
While erythritol is generally considered safe and well tolerated — except in large amounts — you can leave it out of the recipe or use stevia in its place if you prefer ( 36 ,  37 ).

Vanilla coffee creamer
This recipe  for homemade vanilla coffee creamer is a quick and easy option you make in your blender.
For 12 servings, each 2 tablespoons (30 mL), you need:
3/4 cup (175 mL) solid coconut cream
3/4 cup (175 mL) water
1 tsp. (5 mL) vanilla extract
1/4–1/2 tsp. liquid  stevia  with vanilla extract
This homemade creamer is not only keto-friendly but also suitable for vegans or individuals with nut, gluten, dairy, egg, or soy allergies.
While coconut cream is known for being high in calories and fat, it’s a rich source of many essential vitamins and minerals, including phosphorus, potassium,  manganese , copper, and folate ( 38 ).
Two tablespoons (30 mL) of this homemade creamer provide approximately 50 calories, 5 grams of fat, 1 gram of carbs, and 0 grams of sugar and protein ( 39 ).

How to choose a healthy keto-friendly coffee creamer
When choosing a coffee creamer for the keto diet, it’s important to look for products that meet the diet’s macronutrient requirements, as well as ones that have minimal added ingredients.
There are several ways to follow a  keto diet , but it generally calls for limiting carbs to no more than 50 grams per day ( 1 ).
Fats should make up the bulk of the diet and provide around 70–80% of calories. Proteins should account for approximately 20% of calories, while carbs are restricted to 5–10%.
Ideally, this would mean looking for a high fat, low carb coffee creamer. For example, if one serving contains 50 calories, you also want it to provide approximately 4 grams of fat and 1 gram or fewer of carbs.
However, lower fat options can also work, as long as they’re very low in carbs and won’t  knock you out of ketosis .
Keep in mind that macronutrients are just one piece of the puzzle. You also want to look for coffee creamers with a short ingredient list consisting mostly of whole ingredients.
Long ingredient lists can mean that the product is more highly processed. While fine in small amounts, diets high in added sugar, salt, synthetic ingredients, and saturated fat have been linked to an increased risk of chronic conditions, such as obesity, heart disease, and cancer ( 40 ,  41 ,  42 ).
In addition to being high in fat and very low in carbs, the best keto coffee creamer is one that’s mostly made from whole food ingredients. The creamer should also be free of added sugars and artificial ingredients.

Frequently asked questions
Some coffee creamers won’t work on a keto diet, as they contain too many grams of carbs and sugar, which could kick you out of ketosis. Choosing a high fat, low carb creamer or making your own will be the best option.
When you’re following a keto diet, you can add any low or zero carb mix-ins to your coffee, such as the coffee creamers on our list, or high fat ingredients such as coconut oil or grass-fed butter.
You can also try adding a low carb protein powder or sweetener, such as stevia or monk fruit.
Some other mix-ins, like cocoa powder or vanilla extract, could work as well because they contain very few carbohydrates.
If a coffee creamer contains too many carbs, it can kick your body out of ketosis. To stay in ketosis, your overall diet should contain 50 grams or fewer of carbohydrates per day ( 1 ).

The bottom line
You don’t have to give up coffee creamer if you’re on the keto diet.
In fact, there are several healthy keto-friendly options. Just be sure to pick an option that’s  high in fat , nearly carb-free, and mostly made from whole ingredients.
Of course, if you want full control over what you’re putting in your coffee, you can make your own creamer at home.
