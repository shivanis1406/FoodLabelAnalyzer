Title: The 10 Best Foods to Boost Nitric Oxide Levels

Nitric oxide has important roles in your body, such as helping to lower blood pressure, improve blood flow, and boost exercise performance. To increase nitric oxide levels, you can eat foods such as beets, garlic, meat, leafy greens, and citrus.
Nitric oxide is a vital molecule produced in your body that affects many aspects of health.
It helps your blood vessels dilate to promote proper blood flow and may provide various other health benefits, including improved exercise performance, lower blood pressure, and better brain function.
Switching up your diet is one of the best and most effective ways to naturally boost your levels of this important molecule.
Here are the 10 best foods to boost your nitric oxide levels.

1. Beets
Beets  are rich in dietary nitrates, which your body can convert to nitric oxide.
In  one small study in 38 adults , consuming a beet juice supplement increased nitric oxide levels by 21% after just 45 minutes.
Similarly, a  2016 study  showed that drinking 3.4 ounces (oz), or 100 milliliters (mL), of beet juice significantly increased nitric oxide levels in both men and women.
Thanks to their rich content of dietary nitrates, beets have been  linked to  a number of health benefits, including improved thinking ability, enhanced athletic performance, and lower blood pressure levels.

2. Garlic
Garlic can boost nitric oxide levels by activating nitric oxide synthase, the enzyme that helps convert the amino acid L-arginine to nitric oxide.
One  2015 animal study  showed that aged garlic extract helped lower elevated levels of lipids such as cholesterol and triglycerides. But it’s important to note that using aged garlic extract or garlic oil is not the same as eating garlic.
A  2013 test-tube study  also suggests that aged garlic extract can help maximize the amount of nitric oxide that the body can absorb.
Both human and animal studies indicate that garlic’s ability to increase nitric oxide levels may have  health benefits  and can help  lower blood pressure  and  improve exercise tolerance .

3. Meat
Meat, poultry, and seafood are all excellent sources of coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ10 ), an important compound that is believed to help preserve nitric oxide in the body.
Organ meats , fatty fish, and muscle meats such as beef, chicken and pork contain the highest concentration of CoQ10.
Studies show that getting enough CoQ10 in your diet not only preserves nitric oxide but also can help  improve  athletic performance,  prevent  migraine headaches, and  promote  heart health.

4. Dark chocolate
Dark chocolate  is loaded with flavanols, naturally occurring compounds that boast an extensive list of powerful health benefits.
In particular,  research  shows that the flavanols found in  cocoa  can help establish optimal nitric oxide levels in your body to promote heart health and protect cells against oxidative damage.
One  older 15-day study  in 16 people showed that consuming 30 grams of dark chocolate daily led to significant increases in blood levels of nitric oxide.
What’s more, participants experienced decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (the top and bottom numbers of a blood pressure reading, respectively).
Because of its rich content of nitric oxide-boosting flavanols, dark chocolate  has been associated  with improved blood flow and lower blood pressure.

5. Leafy greens
Leafy green vegetables  such as spinach, arugula,  kale , and cabbage are packed with nitrates, which your body converts to nitric oxide.
Regular consumption of nitrate-rich foods like green leafy vegetables can help maintain sufficient levels of nitric oxide in your blood and tissues.
One  2020 study  even showed that eating a nitrate-rich meal containing leafy greens or beet juice equally increased nitrate levels and significantly decreased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
Other  research  has  found  that consuming high nitrate leafy greens may also be associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and cognitive (mental) decline.

6. Citrus fruits
Citrus fruits  such as oranges, lemons, limes, and  grapefruit  are all excellent sources of vitamin C, an important water-soluble vitamin that plays a central role in health.
Vitamin C can enhance levels of nitric oxide by increasing its bioavailability and maximizing its absorption in your body.
Vitamin C may also bump up levels of nitric oxide synthase, the enzyme needed for nitric oxide production.
Studies indicate that citrus fruit consumption may be linked to  improved brain function  and  decreased risk of cardiovascular problems . These effects may be due in part to these fruits’ ability to boost nitric oxide levels.

7. Pomegranate
Pomegranate  is loaded with potent antioxidants that can protect your cells against damage and preserve nitric oxide.
One  older test-tube study  showed that pomegranate juice was effective in protecting nitric oxide from oxidative damage while also increasing its activity.
A  small 2019 study  in 60 people with type 2 diabetes suggested that pomegranate juice had some benefit for lowering blood pressure, but it didn’t confirm any change in the participants’ lipid profiles.
Recent research  has found that antioxidant-rich pomegranate can improve blood flow, which may be especially beneficial for treating high blood pressure.
In addition, a  2016 animal study  found pomegranate juice to be helpful in treating erectile dysfunction. But more human studies are needed to explore these potential positive effects of pomegranate juice and extract.

8. Nuts and seeds
Nuts  and seeds are high in arginine, a type of amino acid that is involved in nitric oxide production.
Some research suggests that including arginine from foods such as nuts and seeds in your diet can help increase nitric oxide levels in your body.
For example,  one study  in 2,771 people showed that a higher intake of arginine-rich foods was associated with higher levels of nitric oxide in the blood.
Thanks to their arginine content and stellar nutrient profile, regularly eating nuts and  seeds  has been associated with lower blood pressure, improved thinking ability, and increased endurance.

9. Watermelon
Watermelon  is one of the best sources of citrulline, an amino acid that your body converts first to arginine and then to nitric oxide.
One small 2015 study  found that citrulline supplements helped stimulate nitric oxide production after just a few hours, but the authors noted that it may take longer to see positive effects on health.
A small  2016 study  in 8 men showed that drinking 10 oz (300 mL) of watermelon juice for 2 weeks led to significant improvements in nitric oxide bioavailability.
According to a  2017 review , upping your intake of watermelon not only enhances nitric oxide levels but also can improve exercise performance, decrease blood pressure, and boost blood flow.
However, a  2022 review  suggests that citrulline supplements may be a more effective way of obtaining these benefits, since eating watermelon every day may not be practical for everyone.

10. Red wine
Red wine  contains many powerful antioxidants and has been linked to some health benefits.
Interestingly, some studies have found that drinking red wine could also increase nitric oxide levels.
A  2016 review  of studies found that resveratrol in red wine is likely to provide benefits against cardiovascular disease by improving the availability of nitric oxide, but more human clinical trials are needed.
For this reason, it’s not surprising that moderate consumption of red wine has been thought to reduce blood pressure and improve heart health.

The bottom line
Nitric oxide is a crucial compound involved in many aspects of health, including blood pressure regulation, athletic performance, and brain function.
Making a few simple swaps in your diet can be an easy and effective way to  increase your levels  of nitric oxide naturally.
Eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and healthy protein foods can help you optimize your nitric oxide levels while promoting better overall health.
