Title: How Long Do Eggs Last Before Going Bad?

With proper storage, eggs can last a few weeks in the refrigerator and around 1 year in the freezer. But their quality may start to decline over time, resulting in changes in taste and texture.
In the United States, eggs are considered a perishable item.
This means they must be kept in the refrigerator to prevent them from going bad.
However, eggs can last for a surprisingly long time when they’re stored properly. In fact, if you throw eggs out as soon as their expiration date arrives, you may be wasting money.
This article covers everything you need to know about how long eggs last before going bad.

Eggs rarely go bad when stored properly
In the United States and certain other countries, including Australia, Japan, Sweden, and the Netherlands,  eggs  require refrigeration ( 1 ,  2 ).
This is because eggs in these countries are washed and sanitized soon after they are laid in an attempt to prevent contamination with  Salmonella , the bacteria often responsible for  food poisoning  from poultry products ( 3 ,  4 ).
Yet in addition to removing bacteria, washing an egg may damage its naturally protective cuticle. This can make it easier for bacteria to move through the shell and contaminate the egg ( 5 ).
The presence of bacteria inside an egg is what eventually causes it to “go bad,” or rot.
However, keeping an egg at refrigerator temperatures (below 40°F, or 4°C) slows the growth of bacteria and helps prevent it from penetrating the shell ( 6 ,  7 ).
In fact, refrigeration is so effective at controlling the growth of bacteria that in combination with an egg’s protective shell and enzymes,  refrigerated eggs  rarely go bad  —  as long as they have been handled and stored properly.
Nevertheless, egg quality declines over time. This means that the air pocket in an egg grows larger and the yolk and whites become thinner and less springy. Eventually, it may simply dry up instead of going bad ( 8 ).
Despite these changes, an egg may remain perfectly safe to eat for a long time ( 8 ).
Eggs won’t stay good forever though, and there is a point at which you’ll want to throw them away.
Eggs rarely go bad if they have been handled properly and are stored in the refrigerator. However, they will decline in quality over time, and you’ll want to throw them away at some point.

How long do eggs last?
If eggs have been transported and stored properly, they can last for many weeks in the refrigerator and even longer in the  freezer  ( 8 ).
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all eggs to be kept below 45°F (7°C) from the time they are washed until they are purchased — but it’s just as important that eggs are handled and stored properly after you’ve bought them ( 9 ).
This means you should refrigerate eggs quickly to prevent condensation from building up, which can facilitate the movement of bacteria through the shell ( 8 ).
Ideally, eggs should be stored in their original carton in the back of the fridge. This prevents them from absorbing odors and protects them from temperature fluctuations as the refrigerator door is opened and closed ( 2 ,  8 ).
You can also use a thermometer to check that your refrigerator is at the proper temperature (below 40°F or 4°C) ( 10 ).
This chart explains how long eggs can be stored before going bad or becoming so low in quality (taste and texture) that it’s best to throw them out ( 8 ,  10 ):
It is not recommended to freeze eggs in the shell. If you want to preserve them for longer than the recommended 3 – 5 weeks in the fridge, you can crack them into a freezer-safe container and keep them frozen for a year or more.
Eggs can be stored in the freezer indefinitely, but their quality will start to decline after a certain point. Additionally, make sure your freezer is below 0°F (-18°C) ( 10 ).
When you’re ready to use them, move the container to the refrigerator to thaw and use within 1 week.
If you live outside of the United States in a country where hens are vaccinated against  Salmonella  and eggs are not washed and refrigerated, eggs can safely be kept at room temperature for 1 – 3 weeks, if desired ( 11 ).
However, after around 5 days at room temperature, the eggs’ quality will begin to decline. And after about 21 days, an egg’s natural defenses will lose their effectiveness ( 11 ,  12 ).
Eggs can be placed in the refrigerator or freezer after this point to extend their shelf life, but they will not last as long as eggs that have been kept in the refrigerator from purchase.
If you live in the United States or another country where eggs must be refrigerated, eggs should not be left at room temperature for more than 2 hours ( 8 ).
Fresh eggs can be kept for 3–5 weeks in the fridge or about 1 year in the freezer. Store them in the original carton away from the door of the fridge to preserve quality.

How can you tell if an egg is still good?
If you’re not sure how long your eggs have been in the fridge, there are several ways to tell whether they are still good or not.
The first step should be to check the sell-by or  expiration date  printed on the carton. If the current date is before this date, you’ve got nothing to worry about.
Alternatively, look for the pack date.
This will be printed as a three-digit number that corresponds to the day of the year that the eggs were washed and packaged. For example, January 1 is 001. If the eggs are less than 30 days from the pack date, you can be sure they’re still good ( 8 ,  13 ).
However, your eggs may still be good for up to several weeks beyond these dates. In this case, the best way to tell if an egg has gone bad is to conduct a sniff test.
Other methods, such as candling or the float test, can only tell you if an egg is fresh but not if it has gone bad ( 8 ).
Before conducting a sniff test, check if the shell has any cracks or a powdery or slimy appearance. If so, toss the egg. If everything looks good, crack the egg open on a clean, white plate before using. Check for any discoloration or a funny smell ( 8 ).
An egg that has gone bad will give off an unmistakable odor. If everything looks normal and the egg has no smell, then it is fine to use.
However, it’s important to note that eggs contaminated with the bacteria  Salmonella  may look and smell completely normal, even though they can make you sick ( 8 ).
Therefore, be sure to cook eggs until both the white and yolk are firm in order to kill any bacteria that may be present. Foods containing eggs, like casseroles, should be cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 160°F (71°C) ( 2 ,  8 ).
Although many people prefer  undercooked eggs , certain populations should avoid this because they are at an increased risk of foodborne illness, including young children, older adults, people who are pregnant, and individuals with weakened immune systems ( 8 ).
For recipes that call for raw eggs, like Caesar salad dressing, it’s best to use pasteurized eggs ( 2 ,  8 ).

If an egg is past the sell-by or expiration date, it may still be good to use. Crack the egg onto a clean, white plate. If it looks and smells normal, then it’s okay to use.

How to use older eggs
If your eggs are not the freshest but haven’t gone bad, there are certain ways to best use them. Likewise, there are certain uses better reserved for fresh eggs.
Older eggs are ideal for boiling. As an egg ages and its air pocket gets larger, it becomes easier to peel. Older eggs are a good choice for  hard-boiled eggs , deviled eggs, or egg salad ( 8 ).
Older eggs can also be used for scrambled eggs, omelets, casseroles, or quiches.
However, fried eggs and poached eggs should ideally be made with fresh eggs.
The longer an egg sits in the fridge, the runnier its yolk and  whites  will be. This means that using an older egg might result in a runny mess instead of a firm fried egg or a compact poached egg.
Additionally, an old egg may not be as effective a leavening agent for baking ( 8 ).
Nevertheless, older eggs can be used for almost any purpose. If you’re not sure how long an egg has been sitting in the fridge, crack it open and conduct a sniff test first.
Boiled eggs are easier to peel if they are made with older eggs. Older eggs are also fine to use for scrambled eggs, omelets, casseroles, or quiches. Fresh eggs are best for frying, poaching, or baking.

The bottom line
If you throw your eggs out once the date on the carton has passed, you may be wasting perfectly good eggs.
With proper storage, eggs can last for at least 3 – 5 weeks in the fridge and about 1 year in the freezer.
The longer an egg is stored, the more its quality declines, making it less springy and more runny.
However, older eggs are still good for several uses. They are ideal for boiling and can be used for omelets, scrambled eggs, or baked egg dishes.
If you’re not sure how long an egg has been in the fridge, crack it open on a clean plate and check that it looks and smells normal before use.
