Title: Lactose-Free Diet: Foods to Eat and Avoid

If you are lactose intolerant, you may experience symptoms after eating dairy products and some prepared foods that contain dairy. Some dairy products have less lactose than others.
The lactose-free diet is a common eating pattern that eliminates or restricts lactose, a type of sugar in milk.
Although most people are aware that milk and dairy products typically contain lactose, there are many other hidden sources of this sugar in the food supply.
In fact, many baked goods, candies, cake mixes, and cold cuts contain lactose as well.
This article takes a closer look at which foods you should eat and avoid as part of a lactose-free diet.

Who should follow a lactose-free diet
Lactose is a type of simple sugar found naturally in milk and milk products. It’s typically broken down by lactase, an enzyme in the small intestine.
However, many people are unable to produce lactase, which results in an inability to digest the lactose in milk.
In fact, it’s estimated that approximately 65% of the world’s population is  lactose intolerant , meaning that they’re unable to digest lactose ( 1 ).
For those with lactose intolerance, consuming products that contain lactose can trigger adverse side effects like stomach pain, bloating, and diarrhea ( 2 ).
Fortunately, following a lactose-free diet can minimize symptoms for those with this condition.
Some people may also adopt a lactose-free diet to decrease their consumption of milk products, which they may desire to do for personal, religious, or health reasons, as well as environmental or ethical concerns ( 3 ).
Others may choose to eliminate lactose as part of a dairy-free diet, which is recommended for those with an  allergy to the proteins in milk , including casein or whey ( 4 ).
Those with lactose intolerance may choose to adopt a lactose-free diet to alleviate symptoms. Some people may also choose to follow a lactose-free diet to decrease their consumption of dairy products.

Many healthy foods can easily fit into a lactose-free diet, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes.

Foods to avoid
Lactose is found primarily in milk products, including yogurt, cheese, and butter. However, it’s also found in a variety of other prepared foods.
Certain dairy products contain  low amounts of lactose  and can be tolerated by many with lactose intolerance.
For example, butter contains only trace amounts and is unlikely to cause symptoms for those with lactose intolerance unless very high amounts are consumed. Notably, clarified butter contains almost no lactose ( 5 ,  6 ).
Meanwhile, certain types of yogurt contain beneficial bacteria that can assist with the digestion of lactose ( 7 ).
Other dairy products that often contain low amounts of lactose include kefir, skyr, aged or hard cheeses, and heavy cream ( 5 ,  6 ,  8 ).
Although these foods may be well tolerated by those with mild lactose intolerance, people with a milk allergy or those avoiding lactose for other reasons may still want to eliminate these ingredients from their diet.
Here are some dairy products that you may want to avoid as part of a lactose-free diet:
milk — all types of cow’s milk, goat’s milk, and buffalo milk
cheese — especially soft cheeses, such as cream cheese, cottage cheese, mozzarella, and ricotta
butter
yogurt
ice cream, frozen yogurt, and dairy-based sherbet
buttermilk
sour cream
whipped  cream
In addition to being present in dairy products, lactose can be found in many other prepared food products.
Checking the label for added dairy may help identify whether a product contains lactose.
Here are a few foods that may contain lactose:
convenience meals
instant potato mixes
cream-based or cheesy sauces, soups, and gravies
bread, tortillas, crackers, and biscuits
baked goods and desserts
creamed vegetables
candies, including chocolates and confectioneries

How to identify lactose in foods
If you’re unsure whether a specific food contains lactose, checking the label can be very useful.
Look for added milk or dairy products, which may be listed as milk solids, whey, or milk sugar.

butter
buttermilk
cheese
condensed milk
cream
curds
evaporated milk
goat’s milk
lactose
malted milk

milk byproducts
milk casein
milk powder
milk sugar
powdered milk

Keep in mind that, despite having a similar name, ingredients like lactate,  lactic acid , and lactalbumin are unrelated to lactose.
Checking the label for added milk or dairy products can help determine whether a product may contain lactose.

The bottom line
Lactose is a type of milk sugar found in a variety of foods, including dairy products and many processed or prepared foods like soups, sauces, and breakfast cereals.
Fortunately, many foods can be enjoyed as part of a lactose-free diet, including fruits, veggies, whole grains, legumes, and proteins.
Additionally,  checking the label  of your favorite foods is a simple strategy to determine whether a product contains lactose.
