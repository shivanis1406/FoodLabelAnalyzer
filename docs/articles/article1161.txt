Title: The Raw Food Diet: A Beginner's Guide and Review

Supporters of the raw food diet believe eating raw foods has benefits, including for weight loss and overall health. But there may also be drawbacks, such as not getting enough calories.
The raw food diet, often called raw foodism or raw veganism, is an eating plan composed of mostly or entirely raw and unprocessed foods.
A food is considered raw if it has never been:
heated over 104–118°F (40–48°C)
refined
pasteurized
treated with pesticides
otherwise processed in any way
Instead, the diet allows several alternative preparation methods, including:
juicing
blending
dehydrating
soaking
sprouting
While most raw food diets are entirely plant-based, some may also consume raw eggs and dairy. Less commonly, raw fish and meat may also be included.
Proponents of the diet typically discourage supplement use while on the diet. They often claim the diet provides all the necessary nutrients.
Supporters also believe that cooking foods harms human health because it destroys the natural enzymes in foods, reduces their nutrient content, and reduces the “life force” they believe exists in all raw or “living” foods.
People follow the raw food diet for the benefits they believe it has, including:
weight loss
improved vitality
increased energy
improvement to chronic diseases
improved overall health
a reduced impact on the environment
The raw food diet is made up mostly of foods that have not been processed or heated over a certain temperature.

How to follow the raw food diet
To follow the raw food diet, ensure at least 75% of your food is raw.
Most raw food diets are made primarily of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Grains and legumes are often permitted but usually need to be soaked or sprouted before eating.
all  fresh fruits
all raw vegetables
raw  nuts  and  seeds
raw grains and  legumes , sprouted or soaked
dried fruits  and meats
raw  nut milk
raw  nut butter
cold-pressed olive  and coconut oils
fermented foods  like  kimchi  and sauerkraut

The raw food diet is made up of foods that have never been cooked. Processed and refined foods are discouraged.

Is raw food healthier than cooked food?
Raw food diet supporters believe that eating mostly or all raw food is ideal for human health.
However, like many core beliefs behind the raw food diet, this idea is not backed by science.
Research shows that both cooked and  raw foods  have health benefits.
The raw food diet discourages cooking because of the belief that cooking destroys the natural enzymes in foods. The diet’s advocates believe that these enzymes are vital to human health and digestion.
High heat does cause most enzymes to unravel or change shape. But many enzymes denature in the acidic environment of the stomach anyway. The body already produces its own enzymes to facilitate chemical processes, including digestion and energy production ( 1 ).
Another core belief behind the raw food diet is that cooking destroys the nutrient content of foods.
Cooking can decrease certain nutrients in food, especially water-soluble ones like vitamin C and B vitamins ( 2 ).
However, cooking increases the availability of other nutrients and antioxidants, such as lycopene and beta-carotene, though this can vary by the cooking method ( 3 ).
Cooking also helps inactivate or destroy some antinutrients in food. For example, cooking grains and legumes reduces lectins and  phytic acid . In large quantities, these can block your body from absorbing minerals ( 4 ).
Additionally, cooking also destroys harmful bacteria ( 5 ).
For these reasons, it’s important to eat a variety of both  raw and cooked foods .
Raw food is not any healthier than cooked food. Cooking decreases some nutrients, yet increases others. It also destroys certain harmful compounds and bacteria.

Raw food diet: Pros and cons
A raw food diet may have some positive points. These can include ( 6 ):
high in fresh fruits and vegetables
high in nutrients and  fiber
limited highly processed foods and  added sugar
weight loss , if needed
lowered blood triglyceride levels
reduced  body fat
The cons can include ( 6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ):
reduced  calorie intake  that may make it hard to meet your daily calorie needs
reduced digestibility of food, which makes it harder for the body to get calories and nutrients
decreased amount of certain nutrients and antioxidants
unbalanced, typically high in either fats or fruits to meet calorie needs
potentially deficient in some vitamins, minerals, and protein, such as vitamin B-12
increased risk of tooth erosion in people who follow a plant-based diet
menstrual irregularities
lower bone mass
Raw food diets are made up of healthy foods and are likely to cause weight loss, but they are often too low in calories and some nutrients.

In the short term, the raw food diet will not likely pose major health concerns.
However, you may have some issues if you follow the diet long-term. These can include:
deficiency in calorie and protein intake
nutrient deficiencies, such as  vitamin B12  and  vitamin D
