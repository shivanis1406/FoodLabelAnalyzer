Title: 6 Foods That May Block DHT and Fight Hair Loss

Green tea, onion, pumpkin seeds, and edamame are some foods that may help lower DHT levels and prevent hair loss.
Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is a hormone similar to testosterone. It  plays a role  in the growth of facial, pubic, and body hair during puberty.
However, high levels of DHT may contribute to hair loss.
Your body naturally converts about 10% of testosterone into DHT using an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase.
Some  research  suggests certain foods and nutrients may help block this enzyme, which could decrease DHT production and prevent hair loss.
Here are 6 foods that may fight hair loss by blocking DHT.

1. Green tea
Derived from the Camellia sinensis plant,  green tea  is among the most popular drinks worldwide.
During production, green tea leaves are steamed, which maintains more of the  tea’s natural compounds . This includes one of green tea’s primary plant chemicals, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG).
A  2019 review  found that EGCG may have anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties that could help prevent  hair loss  by:
protecting hair follicles
stimulating hair growth
boosting the immune system
preventing apoptosis, or hair cell death
Despite these promising findings, the authors note that research on the effects of EGCG on hair loss is limited.
As such, it’s best to speak with a healthcare professional before taking green tea supplements for hair loss.

2. Coconut oil
Coconut oil  comes from the kernel or meat of coconuts.
It’s commonly used for cooking, but it also has various applications in beauty, skin care, hair care, and overall health.
Coconut oil contains a high percentage of fat from medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), primarily in the form of  lauric acid , which  has been shown  to block DHT production in test-tube and animal studies when provided orally.
While these types of studies — known as preclinical studies — help researchers identify whether a specific treatment may be effective or safe, their results can’t be translated to humans.
As such, clinical studies in humans are needed before coconut oil can be recommended for preventing or treating hair loss.

3. Onions (and other foods rich in quercetin)
White onions  add a sweet yet sharp flavor to many dishes.
They contain few calories but boast a high content of antioxidants. One antioxidant,  quercetin , has been shown to  inhibit  the production of DHT from testosterone by blocking the action of the enzyme alpha-5 reductase and decreasing oxidative stress.
Research  has also found that a microneedle combination medication containing copper, zinc, and quercetin may help:
block DHT
promote hair regeneration
inhibit inflammation
Despite these promising results, no studies have investigated the effects of eating onions or taking quercetin supplements on DHT levels in humans.
Other fruits and vegetables rich in quercetin  include :
asparagus
spinach
kale
apples
berries

4. Turmeric
Turmeric  is an herb widely used in cooking and as a powder extract for its health benefits, some of which  include :
reducing  arthritis pain
improving  cholesterol levels
enhancing  exercise recovery
These effects are linked to turmeric’s high concentration of active compounds called curcuminoids, the most studied of which is curcumin.
Preclinical studies have  demonstrated  that curcumin lowers DHT levels by blocking the action of the alpha-5 reductase enzyme.
However, more research in humans is needed to support curcumin products as a treatment for hair loss.

5. Pumpkin seeds
Pumpkin  is a winter squash and a symbol of fall festivities like Halloween.
Each pumpkin contains hundreds of  nutritious seeds  rich in iron,  zinc , and  magnesium .
A  2021 study  found that applying pumpkin seed oil for 3 months helped prevent  female pattern hair loss  and increase hair growth.
Similarly, a  2019 animal study  found that pumpkin seed oil helped promote hair growth.
Despite these findings, additional human trials are necessary before pumpkin seed oil can be recommended for fighting hair loss.

6. Edamame
Edamame  beans are young soybeans typically enjoyed as a snack or appetizer.
Edamame beans contain isoflavones, which are beneficial plant compounds that may lower DHT levels by blocking the action of 5-alpha reductase.
In a  2007 study , 58 males were randomized to supplement their diets with either soy protein high in isoflavones, soy protein that had most of the isoflavones removed, or milk protein.
After 3 and 6 months, the soy protein supplements — regardless of isoflavone content — reduced DHT levels more than milk protein did. While this decrease in DHT was not significant after 6 months, it may still have clinical significance or practical importance.
Moreover, since the beneficial effects were also seen with soy protein that had most of its isoflavones removed, soy may contain other active components connected to these effects.
It’s worth noting that although consuming soy is commonly thought to decrease testosterone levels in males,  research  suggests this isn’t the case.
Regardless, additional studies in humans are needed to determine the effects of consuming edamame or other soy products on DHT levels and hair loss.

Other ways to treat hair loss
If you experience hair loss, speak with a healthcare professional. They could review your medical history and identify potential causes for your hair loss to determine the proper treatment.
Treatment for hair loss may include a  combination of :
vitamins and supplements , such as protein, zinc, iron, and vitamins C and A
natural remedies , such as  scalp massage ,  aloe vera , and  fish oil
laser therapy
topical medications, such as minoxidil ( Rogaine ), finasteride ( Propecia ), and corticosteroids
injections, such as  platelet-rich plasma therapy
hair transplant surgery

Frequently asked questions
Some foods and beverages that may help block DHT include pumpkin seeds, onions, green tea, and turmeric, among others.
Some  research  suggests that blocking DHT may help regrow hair. However, more research is needed to fully understand the link between DHT and hair loss.
Limited research exists on the association between DHT and dietary egg intake. However, adding egg yolks to your diet may help regrow hair or prevent further hair loss due to their high levels of biotin. Some  research  suggests a biotin deficiency is associated with hair loss .
Finasteride (Propecia) is a DHT-blocker medication most commonly prescribed to help treat hair loss associated with DHT.

Takeaway
DHT  is a hormone that contributes to hair loss.
Green tea, onions, pumpkin seeds, and edamame, among other foods and beverages, contain nutrients that may help lower DHT levels and prevent hair loss.
However, based on the limited research, additional studies in humans are needed before any foods or specific nutrients can be recommended to prevent hair loss.
