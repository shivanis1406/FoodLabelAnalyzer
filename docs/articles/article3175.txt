Title: Is Pizza Healthy? Nutrition Tips for Pizza Lovers

The many different varieties of pizza make some choices healthier than others. Compared to frozen pizza, fresh pizza may contain fewer processed ingredients.
Pizza is a favorite food for many around the world.
The addicting combination of delicious crust, sweet tomato sauce and salty mozzarella cheese is sure to please even the pickiest of eaters.
However, it’s commonly labeled unhealthy, as it can be high in calories, sodium and carbs.
This article reviews the nutrition of the most popular types of pizza and provides tips on making it healthier.

Nutritional Breakdown
The nutrition and ingredients of pizza can vary widely depending on the type.
However, some varieties can be loaded with unhealthy ingredients.
Often a diet staple of college students and busy families, frozen pizzas are popular meal choices for many people.
While there are exceptions, most are high in calories, sugar and sodium.
They’re typically highly processed and contain artificial preservatives, added sugar and  unhealthy fats .
For example, one serving (1/4 pizza) of Red Baron Classic Crust Pepperoni frozen pizza contains ( 1 ):
Calories:  380
Fat:  18 grams
Carbs:  39 grams
Sugar:  8 grams
Sodium:  810 mg — 34% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI)
Choosing toppings like sausage, extra cheese and other high-calorie items can add to the calorie content, while French bread style and stuffed crust varieties can pile on even more.
Like frozen pizzas, pizzeria-made pizza can vary in ingredients and preparation methods.
Though the nutrition content of pizzeria pizza is not always listed, some pizzeria chains do make nutrition information available to consumers.
Freshly made pizzas often contain healthier ingredients than the more processed ones sold in convenience stores and fast-food restaurants.
Most pizzerias make their dough from scratch using simple ingredients like  olive oil  and wheat flour.
Depending on the restaurant, some use homemade sauces with no added sugar, fresh cheeses and other healthy toppings.
However, no matter if you choose frozen or fresh pizza, piling on extra toppings can make it unhealthy, so be mindful with your selection when  eating out .
Pizza sold in  fast-food restaurants  and convenience stores is among the unhealthiest of choices.
It tends to be the highest in calories, unhealthy fats, carbs and sodium.
One large slice (167 grams) of Pizza Hut Pepperoni Lovers Pizza provides ( 2 ):
Calories:  460
Fat:  26 grams
Carbs:  37 grams
Sugar:  1 gram
Sodium:  900 mg — 38% of the RDI
Plus, fast-food pizzas usually contain more ingredients than freshly made ones, including  monosodium glutamate  (MSG), artificial colorings and high-fructose corn syrup — all of which may negatively impact your health ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
They’re also often packed with sodium, making them a poor choice for those who are salt-sensitive ( 6 ).
Many types of pizza, particularly frozen and fast-food varieties, tend to be high in calories, fat and sodium. More processed varieties may contain unhealthy ingredients, such as colorings, added sugar and preservatives.

Is Pizza a Healthy Choice?
Although certain types of pizza are unhealthy, other less processed types can be nutritious.
Like all foods, more processed types of pizza are often higher in unhealthy ingredients than those made from scratch.
Frozen and fast-food pizzas can contain ingredients like preservatives, colorings and unhealthy fats.
However, all pizzas, no matter how they’re prepared, are typically made using refined wheat flour.
This type of flour is low in fiber and, therefore, less filling than  whole-grain  flours.
Eating refined grain products — such as ready-made meals like pizza — has been linked to  weight gain .
A study in 1,352 people found that people who consumed over 70 grams of ready-made products like pizza daily were more likely to have more belly fat than those who consumed under 70 grams per day ( 7 ).
Most types of pizzas are high in calories and  sodium , as they’re usually topped with cheese, salty meats and other high-calorie toppings.
Plus, some pizzas contain added sugar in the crust, certain toppings and sauces.
In fact, one serving (1/4 pizza) of Red Baron Barbecue Chicken pizza contains a whopping 21 grams (4 teaspoons) of  sugar  ( 8 ).
Regular consumption of refined foods rich in added sugar has been shown to increase your risk of chronic conditions like obesity and heart disease ( 9 ).
What’s more, choosing stuffed crust or deep-dish pizzas will increase the carb and overall calorie content of your slice.
Though occasionally enjoying a slice of fast-food or frozen pizza most likely won’t impact your weight, eating these items regularly can lead to weight gain and may increase your risk of chronic health conditions.
While many types of pizza are high in calories, fat and sodium, those made with fresh, whole ingredients can be a good choice.
Traditional style pizza is a relatively simple food, made with flour, yeast, water, salt, oil, tomato sauce and fresh  cheese .
Pizza made from scratch using these limited ingredients can be quite healthy.
When making homemade pizza, the nutrient content can be boosted by adding nutrient-dense toppings like vegetables or  healthy protein sources  like grilled chicken.
Many pizza chains offer whole-wheat and gluten-free crusts, as well as healthy topping choices, such as fresh vegetables or herbs.
Though many types of pizza are high in calories, sodium and carbs, those prepared at home or in a pizzeria can be made healthier by adding nutrient-dense toppings or choosing whole-grain crusts.

Healthy Tips
Enjoying your favorite food now and then is a key component of any sound eating plan.
While it’s okay to eat a piece of frozen, fast-food or pizzeria-style pizza occasionally, it’s best to limit consumption to no more than a few times per month.
However, for true pizza lovers who want to enjoy this food more frequently, there are ways to make this cheesy dish a whole lot healthier.
When purchasing a frozen pizza or one from a fast-food establishment, you have no control over what’s put into the recipe.
Making your own gives you the ability to decide what goes into — and what stays out of — your meal.
Making your own crust with wholesome ingredients like whole-grain or  gluten-free flours  can boost fiber content.
You can even choose to make a grain-free crust using  cauliflower  or nut flour.
Top your pie with unsweetened sauce, high-quality cheese and healthy toppings like peppers, sundried tomatoes, broccoli, arugula, chicken,  garlic  or mushrooms.
When making homemade pizza or purchasing a pizza, choose products that contain whole ingredients.
Take a look at  product ingredient lists  and make a point only to buy items that contain whole-food ingredients.
Pass on crust mixes or pre-made pizzas that include artificial colors,  high-fructose corn syrup , added sugar, processed meats or artificial preservatives.
Instead of buying a crust mix or pre-made pies, opt for preparing your own pizza with homemade crust and nutritious toppings.
Overeating any food — whether a healthy choice or not — can contribute to weight gain.
That’s why practicing  portion control  is critical for overall health.
It’s especially important when enjoying foods that can be easily overeaten, such as ice cream, bread, cake and pizza.
Whether you’re consuming a freshly made pizza or a pre-made slice, practicing portion control is an excellent way to prevent excess calorie intake.
When ordering takeout pizza, serve yourself a portion and make a point to eat from a plate, not out of the box.
Try filling up on a fiber-rich green  salad  before enjoying a slice of your favorite pizza for a more balanced meal.
Here are some other easy ways to make pizza healthier:
Pile on veggies:  Top homemade or takeout pizza with cooked or fresh vegetables to boost the  fiber , vitamin, mineral and antioxidant content of your meal.
Avoid processed meats:  Swap  processed meats  like pepperoni and bacon for a healthier source of protein like grilled chicken.
Go for whole-grain:  Opt for whole-grain crusts to increase fiber content.
Choose sauce with no added sugar:  Choose brands that contain no added sugar to keep sugar content to a minimum.
Avoid higher-calorie options:  Order thin crust over deep-dish or stuffed crust options to keep your overall calorie and carb intake under control.
Cut smaller slices:  When cutting yourself a slice of pizza, consider portion control and avoid super-sized servings.
Try different recipes:  Try out veggie and grain-based recipes that use ingredients like portabella mushrooms, cauliflower and quinoa to create nutritious crusts.
There are many ways to boost the nutrition content of your pizza. Choosing whole-grain crust, adding vegetables and practicing portion control are just a few ways to make it healthier.

The Bottom Line
Pizza is not only delicious but can also be a  healthy meal choice  when thought is put into its preparation.
Though many frozen and fast-food varieties tend to be high in calories, fat, sodium and other unhealthy ingredients, pizza can be made healthier.
Practicing portion control, choosing products with limited ingredients, adding healthy toppings and preparing it homemade are some options for health-conscious pizza lovers.
Note that following a whole-foods diet is best for overall health, but it’s okay to enjoy your favorite food now and then — even if it’s not the most nutritious choice.
