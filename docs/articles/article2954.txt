Title: How to Make Bone Broth, Plus Health Benefits

Bone broth may have many nutritional benefits. It is rich in nutrients and may support the health of your bones and digestive system, among other benefits.
Research supporting the benefits of bone broth is limited, but there’s plenty of evidence that the nutrients it provides can be beneficial for health.
This article takes a closer look at bone broth, a recipe for making it, and its potential health benefits.

What is bone broth?
Bone broth is made by simmering the bones and connective tissue of animals.
This forms a stock for making soups, sauces, and gravies. It can also provide a nutritious drink.
Bone broth dates back to  prehistoric times , when hunter-gatherers turned otherwise inedible animal parts like bones, hooves, and knuckles into a broth they could drink.
You can make bone broth using bones from just about any animal — chicken, pork, beef, veal, turkey, lamb, bison, buffalo, venison, or fish.
Marrow and connective tissues like feet, hooves, beaks, gizzards, or fins can also be used.
Bone broth is made by boiling down animal bones and connective tissue. This nutrient-dense stock is used for soups, sauces, and health drinks.

How to make bone broth
Making bone broth is very simple. There are many recipes online, but most people don’t even use a recipe.
All you really need is a large pot, water, vinegar, and bones.
To get you started, here’s an easy recipe you can follow:
Ingredients
1 gallon (4 liters) of water
2 tbsp (30 mL)  apple cider vinegar
2–4 pounds (about 1–2 kg) of animal bones
Salt and pepper, to taste
Directions
Place all ingredients in a large pot or slow cooker.
Bring to a boil.
Reduce to a simmer and cook for 12–24 hours. The longer it cooks, the better it will taste and the more nutritious it will be.
Allow the broth to cool. Strain it into a large container and discard the solids.
To add nutritional value, use a variety of bones: marrow bones, oxtail, knuckles, and feet.
Adding vinegar is important because it helps pull all of the valuable nutrients out of the bones and into the water, which is ultimately what you will be consuming.
You can also add vegetables,  herbs, or spices  to your broth to enhance the flavor.
Common additions include  garlic , onion, celery, carrot, parsley, and thyme. You can add these in step one.
Bone broth is made by simmering bones in water and vinegar. You can also add other ingredients to create more flavor.

1. It contains vitamins and minerals
Bone broth can be nutritious, but the precise nutritional content will depend on the bones you use.
Animal bones  are rich in   calcium , magnesium,  and other  vitamins and minerals needed to build and strengthen your own bones. However, only small amounts of these nutrients — less than 5% of daily value — actually make it into the broth.
Marrow  provides  vitamins A and B and minerals like zinc, iron, calcium, and selenium.
All these parts  also contain  the protein collagen, which turns into  gelatin  when cooked and  yields  several important amino acids.
Simmering the ingredients releases their nutrients into the water in a form your body can easily absorb.
Are collagen or gelatin supplements best?
Bone broth is rich in minerals that help build and strengthen your bones. It also contains many other healthy nutrients, including vitamins, amino acids, and essential fatty acids.

2. It may benefit the digestive system
A healthy digestive tract is essential for well-being.
Bone broth is easy to digest and may help prevent inflammation related to your digestive tract.
Experiments  on animals with colitis have suggested that gelatin may protect and heal the mucosal lining of the digestive tract. However, more research is needed to confirm this.
Gelatin contains an amino acid called glutamic acid. This converts to glutamine in the body and  helps maintain  the function of the intestinal wall. It may help prevent and heal a condition known as “leaky gut,” a symptom of several chronic gastrointestinal diseases.
A leaky gut is when damage occurs between the barrier between your gut and the bloodstream, allowing substances to leak from your gut into your bloodstream. This  can lead  to inflammation and other problems.
A  2021 mouse study  also concluded that the amino acids in bone broth have anti-inflammatory properties that may reduce damage to the gut due to  ulcerative colitis .
For all of these reasons, drinking bone broth may be beneficial for individuals with a range of gastrointestinal conditions.

The gelatin in bone broth supports healthy digestion. It may be beneficial for individuals with leaky gut, as well as irritable and inflammatory bowel diseases.

3. It may help fight inflammation
The amino acids found in bone broth,  including   glycine  and  arginine , have anti-inflammatory properties.
In 2015, for instance, one  animal study  showed that when mice with asthma took oral arginine, they experienced an improvement in airway inflammation and other symptoms of asthma.
Chronic inflammation  has been linked  to various serious diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, and cancer.
Including  anti-inflammatory foods  in the diet, such as bone broth, may help reduce the risk of these diseases.
How do you get started on an anti-inflammatory diet?
The amino acids in bone broth can help fight inflammation. Because of this, eating it may help protect against disease.

4. Its nutrients may improve joint health
Collagen  is the  main protein  found in bones, tendons, and ligaments.
While cooking bone broth, collagen from bones and connective tissue breaks down into another protein called gelatin.
Gelatin contains important amino acids that support joint health.
These include proline and glycine, which  your body uses  to build its own connective tissue. Connective tissue is the main component of tendons, which connect muscles to bones, and ligaments, which connect bones to each other.
However, the amounts of these amino acids are much lower in bone broth than the “therapeutic dose” found in supplements.
Which supplements can help with joint pain?
The amino acids in bone broth help support joint health, and consuming it may help lessen the symptoms of osteoarthritis.

5. Weight management and muscle mass
Bone broth is  typically  low in  calories , but it can still satisfy hunger.
There is some evidence that people who consume soups are less likely to develop obesity. This suggests that soups  may play a role  in managing weight.
Bone broth is high in protein, and  some evidence  suggests a high protein diet can also help manage weight, as it is satisfying and can help a person feel full.
In 2015, a  study  involving 53 males found that, combined with resistance training, collagen supplements helped increase muscle mass and decrease body fat.
However, a 2019  study  noted that bone broth is unlikely to contain levels of collagen similar to those in supplements. Also, the collagen levels and quality in bone broth will be more variable than those provided by supplements.
What does a weight loss plan look like?
The gelatin in bone broth has been shown to help promote feelings of fullness. Consuming it on a regular basis may reduce calorie intake and lead to weight loss over time.

6. It may improve sleep and brain function
The amino acid glycine, found in bone broth, may help you relax. Some  research  has suggested that glycine may help promote  sleep .
One older  study  found that taking 3 grams of glycine before bed significantly improved the quality of sleep in individuals who had difficulty sleeping.
Taking glycine before bed helped participants:
fall asleep faster
maintain a deeper sleep
wake up fewer times throughout the night
This study also found that glycine helped reduce daytime sleepiness and improve mental function and memory.
Therefore, drinking bone broth could have similar benefits.
However, according to  this source , the amount of glycine in a 1-cup serving of bone broth can vary from 500-1700 mg (0.5-1.7 g). So you would need to drink 2-6 cups of bone broth to reach the same dose of glycine used in the study.

Glycine has been shown to promote sleep. Taking it before bed may help improve the quality of sleep, mental function, and memory.

Tips for using bone broth
Here are some additional tips for making and consuming bone broth.
Instead of throwing leftover bones and carcasses from meals in the garbage, save them to make broth.
You can collect the bones in a bag and store them in your freezer until you are ready to cook them.
If you don’t usually buy and eat whole chickens or bone-in meat, you can ask for them at your local butcher or farmers’ market. The meat department at most grocery stores will often have them too.
Bones tend to be inexpensive to purchase, and the butcher may even give them to you for free.
Bones from pastured chicken or  grass-fed beef  bones will most likely provide the maximum health benefits, as they will be from the healthiest animals.
It’s easiest to make broth in large batches, but you can only store it safely in the refrigerator for  3–4 days .
If you need it longer than this, you can freeze it in small containers and defrost individual servings as you need.
If you don’t enjoy drinking bone broth, you can use it as the base for soups, stews, sauces, and gravies.
Here’s a simple tomato sauce recipe using bone broth.
Ingredients
2 cups (473 mL) bone broth
2 cans organic tomato paste
2 tbsp (30 mL) extra virgin olive oil
1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) oregano, chopped
1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) basil, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
Salt and pepper, to taste
Directions
Place all ingredients in a medium saucepan.
Heat over medium-high heat for 4–6 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Reduce to low heat and cover, allowing the sauce to simmer for 5 more minutes.
Serve over pasta or meatloaf, or include it in a variety of recipes.
If you don’t have time to make bone broth, you can get organic and other types from health food stores, supermarkets, and online.
Get bones from your local butcher or farmers market to make your broth. Just 1 cup a day provides good health benefits.
