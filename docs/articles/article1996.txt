Title: 8 Best Vitamin A Supplements: A Dietitian’s Picks

Vitamin A is an essential micronutrient that plays a key role in many aspects of health.
Though it is found naturally in a variety of food sources, many people also choose to supplement with vitamin A for its eye health and antioxidant benefits ( 1 ).
Additionally, some populations at higher risk of vitamin A deficiency may require a supplement, including premature infants, people with cystic fibrosis, and women and children in developing countries ( 1 ).
Here are a dietitian’s picks of the 8 best vitamin A supplements of 2022.

What is vitamin A?
Vitamin A  is a fat-soluble vitamin that’s vital for healthy cell formation and vision. It’s also a powerful antioxidant, which means it can help prevent and reverse cellular damage from oxidative stress ( 1 ).
Liver, eggs, milk, and other animal foods contain vitamin A. The vitamin’s precursors —  carotenoids , which can be converted into vitamin A after they have been consumed — are found in a variety of plant foods, including sweet potatoes, spinach, carrots, pumpkin, and tomatoes ( 1 ).
Vitamin A is also widely available as a supplement — either on its own or combined with other vitamins and minerals — in capsule, softgel, and liquid form.
Increasing your intake of vitamin A may be associated with  several health benefits .
In particular, it may help support eye health by neutralizing free radicals and slowing the progression of disorders such as age-related macular degeneration, which can lead to vision loss ( 2 ,  3 ).
Vitamin A also plays a central role in decreasing inflammation and enhancing immune function ( 4 ).
Additionally, vitamin A is involved in maintaining skin health and can promote wound healing, support the health of the skin microbiome, and protect against issues like  acne  and skin infections ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
Though vitamin A supplements should not be used to replace a well-rounded diet, they can help fill in any gaps in your meal plan.
Vitamin A is often available in single-nutrient supplements and used to promote eye health and immunity. It’s also found in many topical  skin care  products and multivitamins or multinutrient blends.
Vitamin A supplements may be recommended for people at a higher risk of deficiency, including individuals with cystic fibrosis, women and children in developing countries, and premature infants ( 1 ).
Be sure to talk with a healthcare professional before taking a vitamin A supplement, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.

How to choose a vitamin A supplement
Choosing the right vitamin A supplement depends on a variety of factors, including:
Dietary needs and preferences.  Be sure to carefully read ingredient lists to find a product that’s suitable for any dietary needs or preferences you might have, such as a food allergy.
Active ingredients.  If you need only vitamin A, you may decide to stick to a stand-alone vitamin A supplement. However, if you’re looking for a more well-rounded, natural option, you may choose cod liver oil. People looking to take vitamin A to support vision should choose a supplement that’s specifically targeted to vision support.
Additional ingredients.  Look for a vitamin A supplement that contains some fat in the form of oil, which helps your body absorb vitamin A and other fat-soluble vitamins. Ideally, your supplement should also contain minimal amounts of fillers and other additives ( 8 ).
Testing.  When possible, choose a supplement that has undergone third-party testing to ensure product quality. While the FDA has some oversight of dietary supplements, the standards are minimal compared with those for prescription drugs. Third-party testing helps ensure that the product you purchase contains the ingredients listed on the label.

Potential side effects of vitamin A supplements
Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin, which means that excess amounts are stored in your liver and can accumulate in your body ( 1 ).
For this reason, taking high doses of vitamin A can cause several  serious side effects , including ( 1 ):
fetal development irregularities
dizziness
skin irritation
joint or bone pain
nausea
headaches
coma
Some older observational studies have also found that having increased blood levels of vitamin A could be linked to a higher risk of bone loss and fractures, though more research is needed ( 11 ,  12 ).
Other research suggests that beta carotene supplementation could be associated with a higher risk of lung cancer in people who smoke, but results are mixed ( 13 ,  14 ,  15 ).

Frequently asked questions
The best form of vitamin A depends on your personal needs and preferences. Many vitamin A supplements contain preformed vitamin A in the form of retinyl acetate or retinyl palmitate, types of retinol also found in animal products and fortified foods ( 1 ).
Vegetarian and vegan vitamin A supplements generally consist of carotenoids, plant-based precursors that are converted into vitamin A in the body. The best-known carotenoid is beta carotene, but there are several others ( 1 ).
Cod liver oil is another option that some people may prefer over stand-alone  supplements, as it contains several other essential nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D.
However, cod liver oil tends to be lower in vitamin A than other forms, which may not be suitable for those with a deficiency.
Daily supplementation may be recommended for people who have a vitamin A  deficiency  or have certain health conditions.
However, taking too much vitamin A can be harmful, so it’s best to talk with a healthcare professional and use vitamin A supplements only as directed.
People who are pregnant should not take high doses of vitamin A, as it may increase the risk of fetal development irregularities.
People who regularly consume liver, smoke, or take other supplements that contain vitamin A should also avoid using supplements unless advised by a healthcare professional ( 1 ,  16 ).
Older adults and postmenopausal people should also consult a healthcare professional before using vitamin A supplements, as some research suggests that higher intakes of vitamin A could contribute to bone loss ( 11 ,  16 ).
The general recommendation is that adult women consume at least 700 mcg of vitamin A per day and adult men consume at least 900 mcg per day, from both food sources and supplements ( 1 ).
It’s important not to consume more than 3,000 mcg per day from foods and supplements — this amount is the daily upper limit for vitamin A ( 1 ).
Vitamin A is found in a  variety of foods , including animal products like liver, fish oils, milk, cheese, and eggs ( 1 ).
Plant-based sources of vitamin A include leafy green vegetables, tomato products, sweet potatoes, carrots, and fortified cereals ( 1 ).

The bottom line
Vitamin A supplements may be a good idea for you if you have a vitamin A deficiency or are looking to boost your antioxidant intake or eye health.
However, you should limit your intake to no more than the recommended serving size of the supplement and should follow a healthcare professional’s instructions to minimize your risk of vitamin A toxicity.
Carotenoid supplements are an ideal vitamin A source for vegans and vegetarians. You can also get vitamin A from cod liver oil or vision health supplements.
These 8 options are a great starting point for choosing a high quality, third-party-verified vitamin A supplement.
