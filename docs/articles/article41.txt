Title: Juicing for Anxiety or Depression: Can It Really Help?

Antioxidants, vitamins, zinc, and magnesium may help improve depression- and anxiety-related symptoms. One way to incorporate more of these nutrients is by juicing different fruits and vegetables.
Anxiety and depression are predominantly treated with prescription medication, therapy, or a combination of both. You may wonder whether there’s a more natural way of managing these conditions.
This article explores the potential benefits of  juicing  as a supporting treatment for anxiety and depression.

Effectiveness
Juicing is an effective and convenient way to add more nutrients from fruits and vegetables to your diet. As such, it may help aid anxiety and depression.
Healthy dietary patterns , including higher intakes of whole foods, fruits, and vegetables and a limited intake of  processed foods , are associated with a  lower risk of mood disorders .
Researchers believe that vitamins, minerals, and beneficial plant compounds from different fruits and vegetables — which you can get from many types of juice — may offer protective effects on mental health.
For example, one  2023 study  in Korean adults found that including fruits and vegetables, among other components, as part of a high quality diet was associated with a lower risk of stress and depression and a better quality of life.
Additionally, evidence suggests that certain vitamins — including magnesium, zinc, and vitamin C — may improve anxiety and depression symptoms.
For example,  past research  has found low dietary intakes of magnesium and zinc are associated with an increased risk for depression. Other  research  suggests that vitamin C may offer antidepressant-like effects. These nutrients may stabilize:
mood in  episodes of mania
feelings of despair
average heart rate
There’s no one-size-fits-all remedy or treatment when it comes to mental health. Be sure to consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns about your treatment.
Juicing is a simple way to get more nutrients from fruits and vegetables, which may improve symptoms of anxiety and depression.

Beneficial nutrients
Juice is full of nutrients like:
antioxidants
magnesium
B vitamins
vitamin C
zinc
All of which may have positive effects on anxiety and depression symptoms.
Anxiety and depression are associated with increased brain  oxidative stress .
Research  suggests oxidative stress occurs when harmful molecules called  free radicals  build up in your body and damage tissues and cells due to an impaired antioxidant defense system.
According to some  research , oxidative stress is a major component of inflammation processes related to depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors.
Studies  have also found that low levels of antioxidants are associated with more oxidative damage in the brain.
Having low levels of antioxidants is especially true for the Western diet, which is high in highly processed foods.
Studies  have found Western diets in adolescents are associated with an increased risk for depressive symptoms, while the opposite was true for the Mediterranean diet. A key difference is that the Mediterranean diet is characterized by high consumption of fruits and vegetables, both of which are potent sources of antioxidants.
An antioxidant-rich diet can help remove free radicals and protect against oxidative stress-induced damage in the brain, which  research  suggests may help lessen anxiety symptoms.
Magnesium plays a key role in brain function and mood. In fact,  research  has linked  low magnesium  diets with depression and anxiety.
There are two potential ways that magnesium has antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects.
First, past  research  suggests  magnesium deficiency  leads to an up-regulated stress system caused by an impairment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
The HPA axis plays a big role in your:
mood
emotions
how you react to stress
So, impairing the HPA axis can affect how you process stress. This, in turn, may promote the development of  anxiety disorders  and depression.
Second, magnesium modulates your serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic chemical systems.
These systems affect:
mood
motivation
reward
As such, they’re often the target of traditional  antidepressant drugs .
Combined, this means that magnesium may improve anxiety and depression symptoms by regulating both the HPA axis activity and influencing your brain’s chemical systems.
Evidence  also suggests that magnesium may be an effective therapy when combined with antidepressant drugs.
Low levels of vitamins B1 ( thiamine ), B2, B6, and B12 have been linked to a higher risk of depression in past  research .
Vitamin B6 is essential for converting the  amino acid   tryptophan  into  serotonin , also known as the  happiness hormone . As such, it may have mood-enhancing effects.
Plus, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) and B12 (cobalamin) deficiency prevent serotonin from being produced from an amino acid known as  homocysteine . This leads to elevated homocysteine levels, which may worsen depression symptoms.
Another B vitamin, vitamin B9 (folate), and B12 work together to control homocysteine levels.  Re search  has associated elevated levels of homocysteine with more oxidative stress.
It’s worth noting, though, that one  2020 study  observed these beneficial effects only when  folate  came from natural sources like fruits and vegetables. Folate from  fortified foods  didn’t appear to offer the same results.
Research  has also found an inverse relationship between vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and stress-related disorders, including anxiety and depression. This means that low levels of the vitamin may increase the risk of depression, while high levels are associated with improved mood.
Vitamin C  is an antioxidant, which is why it may combat:
anxiety
depression
other stress-related disorders
Just like magnesium, vitamin C appears to participate in the serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic chemical systems. If dysregulated, these systems are believed to contribute to depression.
Past animal studies  show that supplementing with vitamin C may have antidepressant-like effects and improve mood.
Zinc is a  micronutrient  with antioxidant-like properties that contributes to the oxidative defense mechanism similar to some B vitamins.
Supplementation with zinc has also been linked to a decrease in depression-like symptoms in past  studies .
Other  studies  suggest that  zinc supplementation , taken in combination with or without antidepressants, may help reduce depression symptoms. Animal studies on zinc supplementation observed it may reduce depressive-like behaviors.
Combining zinc supplementation with antidepressant therapy was found to reduce depression symptoms in a  2021 research review .
Juicing can help you increase your intake of antioxidants, magnesium, B vitamins, vitamin C, and zinc, which may reduce anxiety and depression symptoms and improve the efficacy of antidepressant drugs.

Best ingredients
A benefit of  juicing  is that you can add just about any fruit or vegetable you can think of.
If you’re considering juicing to improve anxiety and depression symptoms, try to choose ingredients that provide antioxidants, magnesium, B vitamins, vitamin C, and zinc.
But juicing can be high in sugar, which can lead to weight gain and other complications. Try juicing with vegetables and adding a small amount of fruit for sweetness to avoid this.
Here are some ingredients with these nutrients to start you off:
Antioxidants:   broccoli ,  celery ,  cabbage ,  beets ,  kale , berries
Magnesium:  kale, cabbage, green leafy vegetables
B vitamins:  broccoli,  spinach , cabbage, eggs,  low fat milk ,  yogurt , sunflower seed butter
Vitamin C:  broccoli, celery, cabbage, kale,  bell peppers ,  zucchini , citrus fruits
Zinc:  kale, beet greens
You can even mix and match these ingredients when preparing your juice to ensure a nutrient variety.
Include various fruits and vegetables in your juice to ensure you get the desired nutrients.

The takeaway
Juicing is an effective and natural way to add more vitamins, antioxidants, and beneficial plant compounds from fruits and vegetables to your diet. This may improve depression and  anxiety symptoms .
Increasing your intake of antioxidants, magnesium, B vitamins, vitamin C, and zinc may improve your symptoms or the efficacy of certain prescription medications.
However, keep in mind that juicing is meant to accompany the treatment prescribed by your doctor, not replace it.
Be sure to talk with your doctor before making any dietary changes.
