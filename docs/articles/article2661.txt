Title: 22 High Fiber Foods You Should Eat

A cup of kidney beans can provide around one-third, if not more, of the fiber you need per day. Other high fiber foods include berries, cruciferous vegetables, oats, chia seeds, and dark chocolate.
Fiber  has a range of possible health benefits, such as:
promoting  weight loss
lowering blood sugar
fighting constipation
boosting heart health
feeding friendly gut bacteria
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends consuming about  14 grams (g) of fiber for every 1,000 calories  you consume daily.
The following table shows the  recommended fiber intake  for people of different ages:
Most Americans consume only around  15 g  of fiber per day, or half of their recommended needs.

What is fiber and what types are there?
In the past,  experts  used the term fiber to describe a type of carbohydrate the body couldn’t digest. More recently, scientists have found that some digestible substances also share properties with fiber, which makes fiber harder to define.
Here are some ways scientists classify fiber:
Dietary fiber is naturally present in plants that we eat.
Added fiber is fiber that manufacturers add to some products to increase their health benefits.
Soluble fibers are water soluble and therefore digestible.
Insoluble fibers are not digestible.
Soluble fibers come from the insides of plants and include substances such as pectin. They are present in fruits, vegetables, oats, and barley and may help manage blood sugar and cholesterol levels.
Insoluble fibers come from the outer skins of plants and pass straight through the digestive system. They can help prevent constipation. Examples include bran, celery, whole grains, and seeds.

Benefits of fiber
Dietary fiber  can offer the following benefits:
Reducing cholesterol:  Fiber in the digestive tract can help reduce the body’s  cholesterol absorption , especially if you take statins and use fiber supplements, such as  psyllium fiber .
Promoting a healthy weight:  High fiber foods like fruits and vegetables tend to be  lower in calories . Fiber can also slow digestion to help you feel fuller for longer.
Preventing constipation:  Fiber can speed up digestion and prevent constipation. Insoluble fiber adds bulk to the digestive tract, as your body doesn’t digest it. This stimulates the intestines.
Managing blood sugar:  The body takes longer to break down high fiber foods, which means glucose does not enter the bloodstream so quickly. This helps you maintain  more consistent blood sugar levels .
Reducing cancer risk:  Eating enough fiber may help prevent certain cancers, including  colon cancer . One reason may be that some types of fiber, such as the pectin in apples, may have antioxidant properties.
If you’re adding high-fiber foods to your diet, do so gradually over a few days and drink plenty of water, too. This can help prevent adverse effects, such as bloating and gas.

Frequently asked questions
Lentils, pears, celery, leafy greens, and oatmeal are all high in fiber. However fiber comes in  different forms  and people consume different amounts of specific foods, which makes it hard to compare which food is highest in fiber for dietary purposes.
Some top choices to add to the diet are chickpeas, lentils, split peas, oats, apples, pears, almonds, chia seeds, Brussels sprouts, and avocado. However, it’s essential to balance the nutrients in your diet. You’ll need to consider the number of calories and other nutrients per 100 g of a food, not just the fiber.
Adding oatmeal, pulses, and fresh fruits and vegetables to the diet is a good way to increase your fiber intake. Opt for fruits and potatoes with their skins on and choose wholemeal bread over white bread. Adding fiber gradually over several days can help prevent gas and bloating if you’re not used to eating a lot of fiber.
This table shows one example of how you can eat over 40 g of fiber in one day, based on data from the  United States Department of Agriculture .
