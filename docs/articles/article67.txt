In addition to reducing your overall calorie intake, increasing the amount of protein you consume may help you lose weight. Protein powders are a convenient way to add more protein to your diet, but they can also:
Increase feelings of fullness:  Protein helps you feel  full longer , which can help you consume fewer calories.
Boost metabolism:  Compared with carbs or fat,  protein  demands the most calories during digestion and utilization. Therefore, raising your protein intake can increase calorie burning.
Maintain lean muscle mass:  You might also lose fat and muscle when you lose weight. Consuming enough protein — alongside resistance training — can help you  maintain muscle  and prevent a decline in metabolism.
Our editors and dietitians reviewed more than 100 protein powders to determine which are best for people trying to lose weight.

Healthline’s picks of the best protein powders for weight loss


Best overall protein powder for weight loss
Protein type   whey
Nutrition stats per serving   (Chocolate) Calories: 160, Total carbs: 8 g, Added sugar: 3 g, Fat: 3 g, Protein: 25 g
Price   $
Naked Whey is our best overall pick because of its impressively short ingredient list,  Informed Choice  certification, and multiple flavor options.
In addition to Vanilla, Chocolate, and other dessert-inspired flavors, Naked Whey has an unflavored option so you can easily mix it into coffee,  oatmeal , or soups for a protein boost.
For those who need or prefer a vegan option, Naked also offers a pea-based protein powder that boasts a short ingredient list and third-party certification.
Healthline Nutrition editor and registered dietitian  Kelli McGrane  recommended Naked Whey.
“I’m not a huge fan of stevia — the aftertaste just isn’t for me — so I like that Naked Whey uses sugar instead.
“I’ve tried multiple flavors of this powder, but the chocolate is by far my favorite. I love that it has a creamy, rich chocolate taste that isn’t overly sweet. While it’s satisfying mixed with just water and a splash of oat milk, my favorite way to use it is blended in a smoothie with a frozen banana and a handful of spinach.
“The only downside is that, as with most whey-based protein powders, I do notice some bloating and general discomfort if I drink this powder  multiple days  in a row.”

If choosing  organic  is important to you, Ora Organic Vegan Protein Powder may be a great choice since it’s certified organic by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
In addition to 21 grams (g) of protein, it contains a proprietary blend of nutrient-rich foods and greens, including organic pea protein, rice protein, cranberry, blueberry,  turmeric , pomegranate, and kale.
Keep in mind that the specific amount of each ingredient is not listed in proprietary blends, so if you’re sensitive to any of the ingredients, you might want to choose another protein powder.
Ora Organic products are tested by several third-party labs, including Eurofins and JK BioScience Analytical Laboratories.
“I’ve tried a handful of plant-based protein powders on the market, and Ora Organics is my favorite vanilla-flavored option because it lacks the cloyingly sweet, artificial vanilla flavor that many other powders have.
“I also appreciate that the powder mixes easily in a shaker bottle and actually feels refreshing to drink. I primarily use the powder in my overnight oats for a boost of protein in the morning, but it’s also delicious blended into a smoothie.”

This option from Garden of Life tops many of our best-of lists and is our pick as the best protein powder for women trying to lose weight.
Because  calorie needs  differ, we like that the powder includes a smaller scoop, so you can opt for a 80-calorie serving or 160-calorie one.
The powder also provides 20–40% of the Daily Value for iron, a nutrient that women who menstruate might not be  getting enough  of through diet alone.
Garden of Life Sport Organic Plant-Based Protein is NSF Certified for Sport, Informed Sport Certified, NSF certified gluten-free, certified vegan, non-GMO verified, and USDA certified organic.

Momentous Essential Grass-Fed Whey Protein is an ideal pick for those looking to lose weight while gaining muscle mass.
Each 100-calorie serving provides 20 g of protein. The powder also includes ProHydrolase.
While more research is needed, ProHydrolase is an enzyme blend that may increase protein digestion and absorption and  may help increase  blood levels of amino acids, such as leucine, that are important for building muscle.
Momentous Protein is third-party tested and is both  NSF Certified for Sport  and  Informed Sport Certified , which means it’s a good option for competitive athletes.

Drink Wholesome Egg White Protein Powder is worth considering for those who need or prefer to avoid dairy but don’t want a plant-based option.

The powder comes in Unflavored, Chocolate, and Vanilla. You can also choose your sweetener — either  monk fruit  or maple sugar.

Each serving contains 15–20 g of egg white protein and 0–4 g of added sugar, depending on the flavor and sweetener selected.

Drink Wholesome products are third-party tested for heavy metals and pesticides, as well as their amino acid profiles, and COAs are available under each product listed on the company’s website.
Healthline writer and registered dietitian  Ellen Landes  recommended Drink Wholesome after trying free samples a few months back.
Landes shared, “A lot of protein powders, especially dairy-based powders, upset my stomach, but Drink Wholesome didn’t cause any stomach upset for me.”
“It does need to be blended, rather than stirred or shaken, to avoid any clumps, but it’s worth the extra step for a smooth, lightly sweet protein shake. I tried the vanilla flavor and found the taste really pleasant.”
Landes also notes that there is a slight coconut flavor, which she enjoyed but acknowledged that it might not be for everyone.
As for whether she’ll continue to use the product, Landes answered, “Yes, I will continue to use this protein powder. I really enjoy the taste and the fact that it doesn’t bother my stomach the way many other protein powders do.”

How protein powders for weight loss compare
* Nutritional information may vary by flavor.

How to choose
When shopping for a protein powder to support weight loss, be sure to consider the following factors:
Price:  Protein powders vary significantly in price, depending on the brand, the protein type, and the presence of other ingredients. Be sure to consider the recurring monthly cost when determining which powder is right for your budget.
Protein type:  Whether you choose whey, casein, or a plant-based source, the  protein type  doesn’t make a significant difference in terms of its effects on weight loss. Choose the type that best fits your dietary needs and preferences.
Quality testing:  Because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t regulate supplements the same way as pharmaceuticals, it’s important to select a product from a reputable manufacturer. Look for a product that’s third-party tested to ensure that the contents match the label.
Additives:  Protein powders commonly contain  artificial sweeteners , flavors, and other additives to which you may be sensitive or intolerant. Carefully read a product’s ingredient list before purchasing to ensure that the product doesn’t contain an ingredient you need to avoid.
Taste:  Protein powders vary greatly in terms of  taste and texture , so you may need to try a few powders before finding a product and flavor that you enjoy. Keep in mind that protein powders containing artificial sweeteners or sugar alternatives, such as stevia, often have a slight aftertaste that some people dislike.

How effective is protein powder for weight loss?
Protein powder can help increase overall  protein intake , which can support weight loss, as it may help increase feelings of fullness, boost metabolism, and preserve lean muscle mass, even in a  calorie deficit .
Specifically,  whey protein  has been shown to help increase fat loss and preserve lean muscle during weight loss efforts.
However, it’s important to integrate protein powder into a balanced diet and regular exercise routine for the best results.

How to use protein powder for weight loss
Incorporating protein powder is an effective and convenient way to get in plenty of protein that can help you feel full and maintain muscle while eating in a calorie deficit.
Most protein powders can be blended into smoothies, mixed into oatmeal or yogurt, or even used in baking to increase the protein content of meals and snacks without significantly raising the calorie count.
You can use protein powder any time of day, but consuming it after workouts can aid in recovery and muscle maintenance and growth. This can be particularly beneficial if you’re interested in  body recomposition , in which you not only lose weight but also build muscle.
Remember, protein powder can be a helpful component of a weight loss plan, but supplements should never replace the basics — balanced nutrition, sleep, stress management, and regular physical activity.

Frequently asked questions

While there are several protein powder options, including whey and casein (which are made from cow’s milk) and plant-based options such as pea and hemp, one is not necessarily better for weight loss than others.

Some research  suggests that whey protein may be better for preserving lean muscle mass during weight loss, but other research has shown that plant protein may offer  similar benefits  to whey.

Ultimately, the overall amount of protein appears to be the most important factor for weight loss.

Some protein powders are marketed to women, but they can be enjoyed by most healthy adults. Thus, there is no one kind of protein powder that is best for weight loss in women.

As mentioned above, whey protein may be desirable for protecting lean muscle mass during weight loss thanks to its higher leucine content, but many products can help women meet their protein needs when losing weight.

The bottom line

While these products may help you lose weight, you’ll get the best results if you use them alongside a balanced,  reduced calorie diet  and an  exercise  routine.
