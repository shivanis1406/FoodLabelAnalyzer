Title: 8 Foods That Are High in Chromium

Chromium is a trace mineral that plays a role in the way your body breaks down protein, carbs, and fats ( 1 ,  2 ).
It’s not an essential mineral, so you won’t experience health issues if you’re deficient in it.
However, it’s still a good idea to include chromium in your diet.
This article explains why and lists 8 foods that are high in chromium.

Benefits of chromium
According to research, chromium may help lower your triglyceride levels and increase your HDL (good) cholesterol. It may likewise improve  insulin sensitivity  in people with type 2 diabetes ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ).
By improving insulin sensitivity, chromium enhances your cells’ response to the hormone insulin, which your body needs to regulate blood sugar levels ( 7 ).
For this reason, people with type 2 diabetes may want to add higher chromium foods to their diet.
Other people with insulin resistance, such as those with  polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) , may also take chromium supplements. However, research on chromium’s effects in people with PCOS is still inconclusive ( 8 ,  9 ,  10 ).
Many foods contain chromium, and you can take this mineral as a dietary supplement. Its Daily Value (DV) — that is, the amount you should aim to consume per day — is 35 mcg ( 1 ,  11 ).

1. Grape juice
Grape juice is an excellent source of chromium.
Just 1 cup (240 mL) provides a whopping 7.5 mcg or 21% of the DV ( 1 ).
However, the chromium content in grape juice may vary greatly depending on agricultural and manufacturing processes. This is true of other fruits and vegetables, too ( 1 ).
A serving of grape juice also provides 67% of the DV for  vitamin C , an antioxidant that helps protect your body from free radical damage. Vitamin C also contributes to immune defense ( 12 ,  13 ).
What’s more, your body generally absorbs a low proportion of the chromium in your diet. However, evidence suggests that consuming vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, helps increase its absorption ( 1 ,  14 ).
You may enjoy grape juice on its own or add it to a fruit smoothie.
In any case, make sure to opt for a version comprising 100% grape juice with no added sugars. That’s because consuming  too much added sugar  is linked to type 2 diabetes, heart disease, dental cavities, and obesity ( 15 ).
Grape juice is a great source of chromium. One cup (240 mL) provides 21% of the DV. The vitamin C in grape juice may also boost your body’s absorption of chromium.

2. Whole wheat flour
Eating whole wheat products may help you add more chromium to your diet.
Whole wheat English muffins are particularly high in the mineral. For example, one standard-sized (58-gram) muffin provides 10% of the DV ( 1 ).
Other whole wheat baked goods provide smaller amounts of the mineral but may still help you increase your intake.
For instance, a medium-sized (36-gram) slice of whole wheat bread provides 1 mcg of chromium or 3% of the DV ( 1 ).
Additionally, whole wheat flour is a good source of  protein  and fiber, two nutrients that help reduce your appetite, which may aid weight loss ( 16 ,  17 ).
For reference, a 1/4-cup (30-gram) serving of whole wheat flour provides 4 grams of both nutrients ( 18 ).
You can use whole wheat flour as a substitute for all-purpose flour in almost any recipe.
Whole wheat products, such as English muffins and bread, may help you increase your chromium intake.

3. Brewer’s yeast
Brewer’s yeast  — also called baker’s yeast — is an ingredient used in beer and bread making.
It’s a type of fungus known as  Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and it happens to be a rich source of chromium, providing 3.3 mcg per tablespoon (12 grams), accounting for 9% of the DV ( 1 ).
People also use brewer’s yeast as a nutritional supplement to increase a recipe’s protein content, boost their energy, or enhance their immune system ( 19 ).
It may also help manage blood sugar markers in people with type 2 diabetes when they take it alongside their diabetes medication ( 20 ).
Stores typically sell brewer’s yeast in powder form, which you can add to yogurt, smoothies, or sprinkle on top of a salad.
Brewer’s or baker’s yeast provides 9% of the DV for chromium per tablespoon (12 grams), making it an easy way to boost your chromium intake.

4. Orange juice
If you’re not fond of grape juice, you could go for orange juice to add chromium to your diet, though it provides lower amounts of the mineral.
A 1-cup (240-mL) serving of orange juice provides 2.2 mcg of chromium or 6% of the DV. That’s less than one-third of the content in a serving of grape juice ( 1 ).
However, a serving of orange juice packs 90% of the DV for vitamin C. It also contains other antioxidants, such as flavonoids and carotenoids. Consuming these compounds in orange juice is linked to a lower risk of heart disease and inflammation ( 21 ,  22 ,  23 ,  24 ).
As with grape juice, try to stick to 100% orange juice. Check the ingredient list and avoid varieties containing added sugar.
One cup (240 mL) of orange juice provides 6% of the DV for chromium and a wide array of antioxidants that may boost your health.

5. Beef
Animal-based proteins are good sources of chromium.
A 3-ounce (85-gram) serving of  beef  provides 2 mcg or 6% of the DV ( 1 ).
Other animal-based protein sources provide less chromium than beef but could still help add more of the mineral to your diet.
These include turkey and chicken breast. A 3-ounce (85-gram) serving of turkey breast provides 1.7 mcg of chromium or 5% of the DV, while the same serving size of chicken breast provides 0.5 mcg or 1% of the DV ( 1 ).
Beef, turkey, and chicken also provide  vitamin B12  or cobalamin. Your body needs this important nutrient for DNA and red blood cell formation, as well as proper nervous system functioning ( 25 ,  26 ,  27 ,  28 ).
One serving of beef provides 6% of the DV for chromium. Other animal-based protein sources with lower chromium levels are turkey and chicken breast.

6. Tomato juice
Tomato juice  is a highly nutritious and refreshing drink.
A 1-cup (240-mL) serving provides 1.5 mcg or 4% of the DV for chromium ( 1 ).
It likewise boasts high amounts of vitamins, including vitamins A, C, and E. It also contains antioxidants, especially  lycopene , which is associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer ( 29 ,  30 ,  31 ,  32 ).
However, canned tomato juice is typically high in salt, which may lead to increased blood pressure in some people ( 33 ).
Tomato juice is a nutritious drink that provides chromium and many other nutrients with additional health benefits.

7. Apples
Apples  are known for being healthy and nutritious, and they contain some chromium, too.
One medium (200-gram) apple provides 1.4 mcg of the mineral or 4% of its DV ( 1 ).
Apples are also a great source of  soluble fiber  and a group of antioxidant compounds called polyphenols. These compounds are linked to a reduced risk of heart disease ( 34 ,  35 ).
Apples are a great on-the-go snack that’s available all year round. You can explore different ways of enjoying apples, such as adding them to salads or baking them into chips.
Apples are a popular and nutritious fruit that also provides some chromium.

8. Green beans
Green beans  — or string beans — may also help you increase your chromium intake.
A half-cup (73-gram) serving of green beans contains 1.1 mcg of chromium or about 3% of the DV ( 1 ).
Furthermore, green beans are low in a type of compound called FODMAPs. This stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols ( 36 ).
FODMAPs  are a group of carbs that arrive in your gut undigested. Your gut bacteria metabolize them, which can lead to bloating, gas, pain, and other digestive symptoms. This may be an issue for people with digestive conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) ( 36 ).
You may boil, steam, or microwave green beans and enjoy them as a side dish or nutritious snack.
Enjoying a side dish of green beans may help you increase your daily chromium intake.

The bottom line
Chromium is a trace mineral that may help regulate your blood sugar and cholesterol levels by helping with the breakdown of carbs and fats.
You can consume it in various foods, including fruits, vegetables, meat, and whole wheat products.
As such, you’ll probably get all the chromium your body needs by following a balanced diet.
