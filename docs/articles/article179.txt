Title: 20 Best Superfoods for Weight Loss

“Superfoods” is a word often used for nutrient-rich ingredients that confer major health benefits.
Besides promoting overall health, many superfoods contain specific compounds, antioxidants, and micronutrients that may enhance weight loss.
Here are 20 of the best superfoods for weight loss, all backed by science.

1. Kale
Kale  is a leafy green vegetable that’s well known for its health-promoting properties.
It’s a great source of antioxidants and several key nutrients, including manganese and vitamins C and vitamin K ( 1 ,  2 ).
Kale is also low in calories and high in  fiber , a compound that moves slowly through the digestive tract and helps keep you feeling fuller for longer, which may support weight loss ( 3 ).
Try adding kale to your favorite salads, sautéing it with garlic for an easy side dish, or using it to add a pop of color to pasta dishes.

2. Berries
Berries  like strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries are vibrant, flavorful, and highly nutritious.
For example, blueberries are rich in fiber and vitamins C and K ( 4 ).
They can also help satisfy your sweet tooth while providing fewer calories than many other high sugar snacks or desserts ( 4 ).
Berries work well in smoothies or as a topping for yogurt or oatmeal. They also make an excellent snack, either on their own or combined with other fruits in a fruit salad.

3. Broccoli
Broccoli  is a nutrient-dense superfood and an excellent addition to a healthy weight loss diet.
In particular, broccoli is a great source of fiber and micronutrients, such as vitamin C, folate, potassium, and manganese ( 5 ).
Multiple studies also show that upping your intake of cruciferous vegetables, including broccoli, could help prevent weight gain over time ( 6 ).
Add a bit of garlic, lemon juice, or Parmesan — or all three — to your broccoli for a quick and easy side dish. You can also try adding broccoli to salads, casseroles, quiches, or pasta dishes to ramp up their nutritional value.

4. Chia seeds
Chia seeds  are loaded with important nutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids, calcium, magnesium, and manganese ( 7 ).
They’re also packed with soluble fiber, which is a type of fiber that absorbs water and forms a gel in the digestive tract ( 8 ).
Research suggests that consuming soluble fiber may be linked to increased weight loss and body fat loss ( 9 ,  10 ).
Chia seeds are also high in  protein , which can help reduce hunger and regulate your appetite ( 11 ).
Try sprinkling chia seeds over your favorite smoothies, yogurts, or oat bowls to enhance the flavor and texture.

5. Eggs

In fact, eggs are packed with a variety of essential vitamins and minerals in each serving, including  selenium , vitamin B12, riboflavin, and phosphorus ( 12 ).
Additionally, eggs are brimming with protein, which can help promote feelings of fullness to boost weight loss ( 13 ).
Hard-boiled eggs make a great snack sprinkled with some salt and pepper or a bit of hot sauce. You can also enjoy eggs in omelets, quiches, breakfast burritos, and stir-fries.

6. Avocado

Interestingly, some studies suggest that probiotic supplements may play a role in weight regulation and affect appetite and feelings of fullness ( 21 ,  22 ).
To squeeze more probiotics into your diet, try eating kimchi with rice or adding it to stews, grain bowls, or noodle dishes. Sauerkraut goes well in wraps and burgers and alongside sausages, including vegan varieties. It also pairs well with cheese.
There are no rules for how to eat kimchi and sauerkraut, so feel free to experiment with your food pairings. Many people also eat them on their own.
