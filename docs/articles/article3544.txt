Title: The 6 Best Teas for Nausea

The best teas for quelling nausea include ginger, chamomile, honey-lemon, fennel, peppermint and licorice.
Drinking a hot cup of tea is one of the most effective ways to settle an upset stomach, especially if you’re feeling nauseous.
Nausea is characterized by stomach discomfort and the urge to vomit.
In fact, some teas have been shown to help soothe queasiness caused by everything from motion sickness to chemotherapy to pregnancy.
Here are 6 of the best teas for nausea.

1. Ginger tea
Ginger tea  is an herbal infusion made from ginger root.
This root has been used as a natural remedy for nausea for thousands of years and is commonly added to candies, tablets, and chews used to settle upset stomachs ( 1 ).
A review of nine studies reported that  ginger  relieved nausea and vomiting caused by morning sickness, chemotherapy, certain medications, and surgery ( 2 ).
Similarly, a study in 576 people undergoing chemotherapy found that eating 0.5–1 gram(s) of ginger significantly reduced the severity of nausea, compared with a placebo ( 3 ).
Although most studies have focused on highly concentrated ginger extracts and supplements, it’s likely that the same benefits apply to ginger tea.
To make ginger tea, simply grate a small knob of peeled ginger and steep it in boiling water for 10–20 minutes, depending on how strong you like it. Next, strain the ginger and enjoy as is, or add a bit of honey, cinnamon, or lemon.
You can buy ginger tea bags as well — either in health shops, grocery stores, or  online .
Ginger is a common natural remedy used to treat nausea. It makes a soothing cup of tea whether steeped from the whole root or using a tea bag.

2. Chamomile tea
Chamomile tea comes from a sweet, earthy  flower  enjoyed for its distinct flavor and health-promoting properties.
In traditional medicine, chamomile has been used to relax your digestive muscles and treat conditions like motion sickness, nausea, vomiting, gas, and indigestion ( 4 ).
According to a 4-month study in 65 women undergoing chemotherapy, taking 500 mg of chamomile extract twice daily reduced the frequency of vomiting ( 5 ).
Meanwhile, a study in 105 women noted that taking chamomile extract was more effective than ginger at reducing nausea and vomiting caused by pregnancy ( 6 ).
However, note that pregnant women should consult their healthcare provider before drinking chamomile tea, as it and other herbal teas may pose a risk to their pregnancy ( 7 ).
While these studies have tested highly concentrated extracts of the flower itself,  chamomile tea  may offer similar effects.
To make it, steep 1 tablespoon (2 grams) of dried chamomile in 1 cup (240 ml) of hot water for 5–10 minutes.
You can also buy tea bags in stores or  online .
Chamomile tea may relax your digestive muscles to help relieve nausea and vomiting.

3. Honey lemon tea
Honey lemon tea is a popular tea that pairs a refreshing citrus flavor with a sweet finish.
Multiple studies demonstrate that the scent of  lemon  alone can relieve nausea.
For instance, a 4-day study in 100 pregnant women showed that smelling lemon essential oil led to significant reductions in nausea and vomiting ( 8 ).
Meanwhile,  honey  balances out lemon’s acidic tang. It also boasts antibacterial properties, which may protect against infections that could contribute to nausea ( 9 ).
It’s simple to make homemade honey lemon tea. To do so, add 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of lemon juice and 2 teaspoons (15 ml) of honey to 1 cup (240 ml) of hot water and stir.
Honey lemon tea may fight nausea due to lemon’s citrusy aroma and honey’s antibacterial properties.

4. Fennel tea
Fennel is an aromatic herb and vegetable that’s closely related to carrots, celery, coriander, and dill.
It has long been used as a natural remedy for a wide array of ailments, including stomach pain, diarrhea, and  constipation  ( 10 ).
Some of these properties are backed by research.
For example, one study in 80 women found that taking a capsule with 30 mg of fennel before menstruation helped reduce symptoms like nausea and weakness ( 11 ).
What’s more, a study in 159 people determined that drinking 1 cup (240 ml) of fennel tea per day helped promote digestive health, gut recovery, and bowel regularity after surgery ( 12 ).
You can make fennel tea by adding 1 teaspoon (2 grams) of dried  fennel seeds  to 1 cup (240 ml) of hot water. Steep it for 5–10 minutes, then strain.
You can also purchase tea bags  online  or in stores.
Studies show that fennel tea may help improve digestive health and relieve symptoms like stomach pain and nausea.

5. Peppermint tea
Peppermint tea  is one of the most popular teas to treat stomach pain and nausea.
In animal studies, peppermint oil has been shown to reduce pain and relax muscles in the  digestive tract  ( 13 ).
Another study in 123 people found that simply inhaling peppermint oil significantly reduced nausea after surgery ( 14 ).
Peppermint tea likely offers health benefits similar to those of the oil.
Peppermint tea bags are available at most major grocery stores, as well as  online . Alternatively, you can make your own by steeping 10–15 crushed peppermint leaves in 1 cup (240 ml) of hot water for 10–15 minutes.
Research suggests that peppermint oil and its tea may reduce pain and nausea.

6. Licorice tea
Licorice is an herb with a distinct bittersweet flavor.
In addition to being added to candies, chewing gum, and beverages, it has long been used in traditional medicine to treat digestive distress ( 15 ).
One monthlong study in 54 people found that taking 75 mg of licorice extract twice daily reduced symptoms of indigestion, including nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, and  bloating  ( 16 ).
Other research has found that licorice extract could help heal  stomach ulcers , which can trigger symptoms like bloating, stomach discomfort, nausea, and vomiting ( 17 ,  18 ,  19 ).
Licorice root tea bags can be found  online  and at many grocery stores and health shops.
However, because most of the available research on the topic used extracts, additional high-quality studies are needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of licorice tea.
This herb may cause negative side effects like high blood pressure if consumed in high amounts. These side effects may be exacerbated by low levels of potassium ( 20 ).
For this reason, it’s best to limit your intake to just 1 cup (240 ml) per day. Be sure to talk to your healthcare provider if you have any underlying health conditions ( 21 ).
Furthermore, as is the case with other herbal teas, pregnant women should not drink licorice tea before consulting their healthcare provider, as it may pose a risk to their pregnancy ( 7 ).
Licorice tea may relieve nausea by reducing symptoms of indigestion and healing stomach ulcers. However, more research on its safety is needed due to its potential side effects.

The bottom line
Sipping on a hot cup of  tea  can be a great way to relieve your nausea.
Certain teas, such as ginger, chamomile, and peppermint, may be especially beneficial. Some may even  soothe other digestive issues  like stomach pain, bloating, and discomfort.
Most of these teas are easy to make at home using store-bought tea bags or fresh or dried herbs.
