Title: What Is Ayahuasca? Experience, Benefits, and Side Effects

Ayahuasca is a type of brew made from ingredients with hallucinogenic properties. Though some claim that it can benefit brain health and well-being, it is also associated with several potential risks.
Ayahuasca, also known as the tea, the vine, and la purga, is a brew made from the leaves of the Psychotria viridis shrub along with the stalks of the Banisteriopsis caapi vine. Other plants and ingredients may be added as well.
This drink was used for spiritual and religious purposes by ancient Amazonian tribes and is still considered sacred by some religious communities in Brazil and North America, including the Santo Daime.
While it’s illegal in the United States, certain groups have exemptions for ceremonial use.

What are the effects?
The main ingredients of Ayahuasca, Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis, both have hallucinogenic properties.
Psychotria viridis contains N, N-dimethyltryptamine ( DMT ), a psychedelic substance that occurs naturally in the plant.
DMT is a powerful hallucinogenic chemical. However, it has low bioavailability, as it gets rapidly broken down by enzymes called monoamine oxidases (MAOs) in your  liver  and gastrointestinal tract.
To produce a hallucinogenic effect, DMT must be combined with something containing  MAO inhibitors  (MAOIs). Banisteriopsis caapi contains potent MAOIs called β-carbolines, which also have psychoactive effects of their own.
When combined, these two plants form a powerful psychedelic brew that affects the central nervous system, leading to an altered state of consciousness that can include hallucinations, out-of-body experiences, and euphoria.

How is Ayahuasca used?
Though Ayahuasca was traditionally used for religious and spiritual purposes by specific populations, it has become popular worldwide among those who seek a way to open their minds, heal from past traumas, or simply experience an Ayahuasca journey.
It’s strongly recommended that Ayahuasca only be taken when supervised by an experienced shaman, as those who take it need to be looked after carefully, as an Ayahuasca trip leads to an altered state of consciousness that lasts for many hours.
Many people travel to countries like Peru, Costa Rica, and Brazil, where multi-day Ayahuasca retreats are offered. They’re led by experienced shamans, who prepare the brew and monitor participants for safety.
Before partaking in an Ayahuasca ceremony, facilitators recommended that participants abstain from cigarettes, drugs,  alcohol , sex, and caffeine to purify their bodies.
It’s also often suggested to follow various diets, such as vegetarianism or  veganism , for 2 to 4 weeks before the experience. This is claimed to free the body of toxins.
Ayahuasca ceremonies are usually held at night and last until the effects of Ayahuasca have worn off. After the space is prepared and blessed by the shaman leading the ceremony, Ayahuasca is offered to participants, sometimes split into several doses.
After consuming the Ayahuasca, most people start to feel its effects within  20 to 60 minutes . The effects are dose-dependent, and the experience lasts  2 to 6 hours .
Those who take Ayahuasca can experience symptoms like  vomiting , diarrhea, feelings of euphoria, strong visual and auditory hallucinations, mind-altering psychedelic effects, fear, and paranoia.
It should be noted that some adverse effects, such as vomiting and diarrhea, are considered normal parts of the cleansing experience.
People react to Ayahuasca differently. Some experience euphoria and a feeling of enlightenment, while others go through severe  anxiety  and panic. It’s not uncommon for those taking Ayahuasca to experience both positive and negative effects from the brew.
The shaman and others who are experienced in Ayahuasca offer spiritual guidance to participants throughout the Ayahuasca experience and monitor participants for safety. Some retreats have medical staff on hand as well, in case of emergencies.
These ceremonies are sometimes conducted consecutively, with participants consuming Ayahuasca a few nights in a row. Every time you take Ayahuasca, it results in a different experience.

Potential benefits of Ayahuasca
Many people who have taken Ayahuasca claim that the experience led to positive, long term, life-altering changes. This may be due to the effects of Ayahuasca on the neurological system.
Recent research has shown that Ayahuasca may have certain health benefits.
The main active ingredients in Ayahuasca — DMT and β-carbolines — may have some qualities that make them beneficial for your brain.
DMT  activates  the sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R), a protein that blocks neurodegeneration and regulates the production of antioxidant compounds that help  protect your brain  cells.
Harimine, the main β-carboline in Ayahuasca, may also have  memory-boosting , based on test-tube and animal  studies .
Additionally,  a test-tube study  suggests that exposure to harmine increased the growth of human neural progenitor cells by over 70% in 4 days. These cells generate the growth of new neural cells in your brain.
Taking Ayahuasca may increase the  mindfulness  capacity of your brain and improve your overall psychological well-being.
A  small 2018  study involving 20 participants found that consuming Ayahuasca once weekly for 4 weeks was as effective as an 8-week mindfulness program at increasing acceptance, a component of mindfulness that plays a fundamental role in psychological health.
A  2018 study  involving 57 people demonstrated that ratings of depression and stress significantly decreased immediately after they consumed Ayahuasca. These effects were still significant 4 weeks following the Ayahuasca consumption.
Some research suggests that Ayahuasca may benefit those with depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use disorders.
A  2018 study  of 29 people with treatment-resistant depression found that a single dose of Ayahuasca led to significant improvements in depression severity compared with a placebo.
Additionally, a  2016 review  of six studies suggested Ayahuasca may be beneficial for those with depression, anxiety, mood disorders, and drug dependence.
Several older studies have focused on the effects of Ayahuasca on substance use disorders.
In one  2013 study , 12 people with severe psychological and behavioral issues related to substance misuse participated in a 4-day treatment program that included 2 Ayahuasca ceremonies.
At a 6-month follow-up, they demonstrated significant improvements in mindfulness, hopefulness, empowerment, and overall quality of life. Plus, self-reported use of tobacco, cocaine, and alcohol significantly declined.
Researchers  hypothesize  that Ayahuasca may help those with PTSD as well, though more research in this area is needed.
While Ayahuasca may have some potential benefits, it’s worth noting that many of the studies involving Ayahuasca have been extremely small or limited to animal and test tube studies.

Considerations and potential side effects
While taking part in an Ayahuasca ceremony may seem alluring, consuming this psychedelic brew can lead to serious, even life threatening, side effects.
For starters, the expected side effects of ayahuasca can be extremely uncomfortable. These include:
vomiting
diarrhea
paranoia
panic
What’s more, ayahuasca can interact dangerously with many medications, including antidepressants, psychiatric medications, drugs used to control Parkinson’s disease, cough medicines,  weight loss  medications, and others.
Those with a history of psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, should avoid Ayahuasca, as taking it could  worsen  their psychiatric symptoms and result in mania.
Additionally, taking Ayahuasca can  increase  your heart rate and blood pressure, which may result in dangerous side effects if you have a  heart condition .
There have been several reported deaths due to Ayahuasca consumption, but they may be due to the addition of other ingredients or dosing issues. Death has  never been reported  in a clinical trial on Ayahuasca.
Aside from these dangers, participating in an Ayahuasca ceremony means putting your life in the shaman’s hands, as they’re in charge of the ingredients added to the brew, as well as determining proper dosing and monitoring you for potentially life threatening side effects.
There have been reports of Ayahuasca retreats being offered by untrained individuals, who are not well-versed in the preparation, dosing, or side effects of Ayahuasca, putting participants in danger.
Moreover, though there have been promising findings related to the health benefits of Ayahuasca, these benefits were mostly related to clinical studies in which the preparation and dosing of the concoction were carefully controlled.
Additionally, if you participate in an Ayahuasca ceremony in another country, it may be more challenging to seek medical attention in case of an emergency.

The bottom line
Ayahuasca is made from parts of the Psychotria viridis shrub and Banisteriopsis caapi vine. It has powerful hallucinogenic properties and may cause both positive and negative health effects.
Much more research is needed to determine whether it can be used as an alternative treatment for certain health conditions.
If you’re interested in participating in an Ayahuasca experience, be sure to do your research and know that safety is not guaranteed, even if the Ayahuasca is prepared and delivered by an experienced shaman.
