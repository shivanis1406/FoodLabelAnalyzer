Title: What Is Collinsonia Root, and Is It Effective?

Collinsonia root, also known as stone root or knob root, originates from a perennial herb native to the eastern parts of North America.
It’s touted as an effective herbal remedy for a variety of ailments, including hemorrhoids, digestive conditions, and upper respiratory tract problems ( 1 ).
Despite its use in traditional Native American medicine, insufficient scientific information is available.
This article reviews the available science behind collinsonia root, plus its purported health benefits.

What is collinsonia root?
Collinsonia root is the root of the  Collinsonia canadensis  plant, a perennial herb with a lemon-like scent that comes from the same family as  mint  ( 1 ,  2 ).
Although you may reportedly use all parts of the plant for herbal remedies, the root is most commonly utilized and believed to offer the most powerful benefits ( 1 ).
It’s dark brown and has a knotty texture, very hard exterior, and pungent odor that’s said to disappear upon drying ( 1 ,  2 ).
Collinsonia root is most often praised for its sedative and muscle-relaxant effects. It’s generally promoted as an effective natural treatment for pain or various digestive, urinary, or respiratory problems ( 1 ).
Although it can be sourced in its whole form and fresh or dried, it’s commonly purchased ground, encapsulated, or as a tea,  tincture , or liquid extract.
Collinsonia root is a dark, knotty root sourced from the  Collinsonia canadensis  plant. Available in various forms, it’s usually used as a natural remedy against pain and digestive, urinary, or respiratory issues.

Possible benefits of collinsonia root
Collinsonia root is said to offer a variety of health benefits. For instance, it’s thought to contain saponins and flavonoids, two compounds that may help treat hemorrhoids ( 3 ,  4 ).
Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in your lower rectum. Older medical reports suggest that collinsonia root suppositories may improve blood flow between your gut and liver, thus alleviating hemorrhoids ( 1 ,  2 ).
In addition, recent research suggests that the anti-inflammatory compounds in collinsonia root may be useful in the management of Alzheimer’s disease ( 5 ).
More specifically, collinsonia root contains polyphenols, thymol, and carvacrol, all of which may help prevent the breakdown of a key enzyme involved in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease ( 5 ).
Moreover, older case reports suggest that this root may reduce anal inflammation, spasms, and prolapses, as well as relieve abdominal or pelvic symptoms caused by these conditions ( 2 ).
Collinsonia root is also reported to increase urine flow, reduce spasms, and relax your ureters and urethra. This is believed to help you pass small  kidney stones  and relieve the associated pain and irritation ( 1 ).
Certain reports also claim that this root alleviates menstrual and lower back pain, spine problems, stomach acidity,  headaches , colic, cramps, indigestion, cough, and asthma ( 1 ,  2 ).
However, most case studies and preliminary reports are over 100 years old and lack the scientific rigor of contemporary studies. Furthermore, most purported benefits have very limited evidence behind them.
As such, more research is needed before strong conclusions can be made.
Collinsonia root is said to offer a variety of benefits, but there’s currently little scientific evidence behind them. Therefore, further studies are necessary.

Effective dosage
Due to a lack of recent scientific studies on collinsonia root, little data exists on its effective dosages.
Appropriate dosages likely depend on factors like your age, particular ailments, and overall health.
Very old case reports note 1 cup (240 mL) of infusion, 10–60 grains of powdered root, 1–3.5 mL of root extract, or up to 7 mL of tincture as the most common dosages. Yet, more studies are needed to determine which forms or dosages — if any — are effective ( 1 ).
Due to a lack of research, the most effective amount or form of collinsonia root is unknown.

Possible side effects
Based on old reports, collinsonia root appears generally safe in moderation. Small doses purportedly produce a warm sensation in your stomach or bowels, while larger doses may cause excessive sweating,  nausea , or repeated vomiting ( 1 ).
That said, specific doses aren’t well defined in these studies.
There’s currently little information regarding the safety of collinsonia root for vulnerable populations, such as infants, children, and  those who are pregnant  or breastfeeding. Therefore, it’s likely best that these populations avoid this compound.
Furthermore, due to its possible diuretic effects, collinsonia root may lead to dehydration or interact with certain medications. If you’re taking any medication, talk with your healthcare provider before taking this supplement ( 1 ).
Collinsonia root is generally considered safe. Still, infants, children, those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and people taking certain medications should avoid it.

The bottom line
Collinsonia root is an herbal remedy touted for a variety of health benefits, including  hemorrhoid  and kidney stone relief.
Although it has long been used in Native American medicine, very little scientific evidence supports its purported effects.
Until more research is conducted, infants, children, and those who are pregnant or breastfeeding should steer clear of it. If you’re interested in taking it, speak with your healthcare provider first.
