Title: 13 Scrumptious Whole30 Lunch Ideas

Whole30 is a popular 30-day program that cuts out added sugar, artificial sweeteners, alcohol, grains, most legumes, dairy, and food additives, like carrageenan.
It’s meant to act as a “reset” for your body by eliminating foods that may negatively affect health. It can also help people identify foods that may be causing digestive issues, such as bloating and diarrhea ( 1 ).
Following this program can be a rewarding experience, but it can also be quite challenging to keep coming up with Whole30-approved meals.
Lunchtime may be particularly difficult for those following Whole30, especially during days when you’re short on time and need something quick and easy to prepare.
Fortunately, there are plenty of delicious Whole30-approved recipes, plus premade and on-the-go options, that make a perfect choice for lunch.

However, you may be able to find options at Chipotle and Five Guys. Whole30 has approved some menu items at these popular lunch spots.
Or you can make your own Whole30-approved lunch at grocery stores that offer salad bars and hot food options, like Whole Foods.

Some hot bar options like roast chicken, roasted potatoes, and grilled vegetables can be Whole30-friendly as well. However, keep in mind that some establishments use canola oil to cook their foods, which is not Whole30 approved.
Five Guys is a fast food restaurant that offers Whole30-approved menu options.

How to meal prep while following Whole30
It’s a good idea to prepare at least some of your lunches at home, even though it’s possible to find Whole30-compliant options on the go and stock up on premade Whole30-approved meals.
By cooking at home, you know exactly what you’re eating and can make a variety of meals based on your preferences.
You’ll also save money by cooking your meals from scratch as opposed to choosing premade options.
For example, a frittata containing sweet potato,  spinach , and cauliflower could cost about $13 for the ingredients, according to our estimates using grocery prices found online. This recipe makes at least four servings, so each serving would cost about $3.25 or less.
Meal prepping can make it much easier to stick to Whole30 because you’ll have your lunches for the week ahead ready to go, which is particularly helpful if you have a busy schedule.
To meal prep successfully, you’ll need to stock your kitchen with Whole30-approved ingredients. Start by printing out this  Whole30-compliant grocery list . Take it to the store to stay organized while you’re shopping.
After you’re stocked up on groceries, plan a menu and set aside some cooking time once or twice a week, depending on how many meals you want to prepare.
If you’re new to meal prepping, start with making just a few meals per week to make your life a little easier when following Whole30.
