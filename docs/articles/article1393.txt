Title: 22 Healthy Foods That Don’t Spoil Easily



One problem with whole, natural foods is that they tend to spoil easily.
Therefore, eating healthy is associated with frequent trips to the grocery store.
It can also be a challenge when traveling without access to a refrigerator.
Still, many healthy foods can be stored long term without spoiling, as long as you have the right temperature and moisture conditions.
Here are 22 healthy foods that don’t spoil easily.

1. Nuts
With so many options to choose from, nuts are a great source of  protein , fat, and fiber that offer a lot of variety.
Most types of nuts last for about a year — even longer if frozen.

2. Canned meats and seafood
Canned meats and seafood can last for 2–5 years in many cases.
They’re an excellent source of protein and, in the case of canned fish,  omega-3  fatty acids.

3. Dried grains
Grains  can typically be stored for years, as long as they’re kept dry and sealed tightly.
If you need to follow a  gluten-free  diet, consider rice, buckwheat, and gluten-free oats.

4. Dark chocolate
Dark chocolate  that’s stored in a cool, dry place can last 4–6 months past the “best by” date on its label.
It’s an excellent source of fiber, magnesium, and many other important nutrients.

5. Canned fruits and veggies
Canned  fruits  and vegetables that have been fermented or pickled are sold in airtight containers.
Because they’re usually packaged in an acidic solution, they can last for years.
When buying canned fruits, be sure to choose a variety that doesn’t contain a lot of added sugar.

6. Dried fruit
Dried fruit  is loaded with various nutrients, including fiber. However, it should only be consumed in moderation due to its high sugar and calorie contents.
The dehydration process prevents the fruit from molding easily.

7. Canned coconut milk
Coconut milk is high in  saturated fat , but this type of fat tends to be stable and doesn’t go rancid easily.
When canned coconut milk is sealed properly, it will resist spoiling for over a year.

8. Dried beans
Beans are one of the easiest sources of protein to  store long term . They have a naturally low moisture content and can last for years.
Additionally, beans are among the most nutritious foods you can eat. They’re loaded with protein, fiber, and various important minerals, such as magnesium.

9. Jerky
Just like dried beans, jerky can be a great choice if you need  high-protein  options.
Pretty much any meat can be dried or dehydrated and stored for up to a year or more, as long as it’s stored in airtight packaging.

10. Protein powders
Protein powders , including whey protein or  vegan options , are easy-to-store protein sources that can last up to 5 years.

11. Dehydrated milk
Similar to protein powder, dehydrated milk powder stores easily and lasts even longer, or up to 10 years.

12. Honey
Honey  is a natural antibiotic due to its high sugar and surprisingly low moisture contents.
Therefore, properly stored honey can last for years or even much longer. In fact, some people claim it  never goes bad .
If you want to use a sweetener, honey is healthier than refined sugar. However, it should only be consumed in moderation.

13. Hard cheese encased in wax
When hard cheese is sealed in a waxy outer coating, it can last up to 25 years before beginning to spoil.

14. Ghee
Ghee  is clarified butter from which all the non-fat solids have been removed.
Because it consists largely of saturated fats, it can last a very long time at room temperature if it’s well sealed.

15. Coconut oil
Similar to ghee, coconut oil is high in saturated fat and can last for years on a shelf at room temperature.
It’s also handy to keep around for a  variety of health reasons .

16. Extra virgin olive oil
Just like coconut oil, olive oil can keep for a year or more if kept in a dark, cool location. It also has many impressive  health benefits .

17. Canned olives
Olives are a healthy source of fat and can last for over a year if canned properly.

18. Seeds
Many kinds of  seeds  provide protein, fat, and a lot of fiber. Try flax,  chia , sunflower, and pumpkin seeds for some variety.

19. Vinegar
Because vinegar is a mild acid, it can theoretically last indefinitely, as long as it remains sealed.
The same goes for  apple cider vinegar , as long as it’s kept in a cool, dry place.

20. Red wine
In most cases, wines taste best after aging for several years. In the case of  red wine , it can also have some impressive health benefits when consumed in moderation.
Shelf life may vary depending on how the wine is produced. Most commercially bottled wines are on a shelf for 1–3 years, but fine wine can often last for decades.

21. Salt
You’ve likely never seen mold grow on salt. Pure  salt  is a very inhospitable environment for bacteria and will never spoil.

22. Dried herbs and spices
Just like other plants that have had their moisture content removed, dried  herbs and spices  are fantastic foods to carry or store for long periods.
As long as they’re kept dry, they can often last for years.

The bottom line
The best foods to store for long periods are those that contain little or no moisture and are not temperature sensitive.
Foods that have a higher moisture content can be stored long term in many cases but require special procedures to keep them from spoiling.
