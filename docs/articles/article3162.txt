Title: 22 Foods That Are Very Low in Calories

Low calorie foods can be paired with calorie and nutrient-rich foods as part of a healthy weight-loss plan. Some surprising swaps can taste great and improve your overall health.
A healthy diet should contain calorie-dense foods, as well as those that are lower in calories.
For example, foods high in healthy fats, such as eggs, nuts, seeds, and avocados, are much higher in calories than foods like fruits and vegetables but still very nutritious.
Pairing calorie-dense foods like the ones listed above with lower calorie foods, especially fruits and vegetables, can make meals more filling and satisfying.
Plus, swapping out some high calorie foods with lower calorie foods can help promote healthy weight loss and may improve other aspects of health as well.
If you usually have eggs and a donut every morning, for example, replacing the donut with an apple or some sautéed vegetables not only reduces the calorie content but also packs in many more nutrients and protective plant compounds.
Fortunately, many low calorie foods can be paired with more filling foods to make a complete meal.
Here are 22 foods that are very low in calories.

Fruit
Apples are highly nutritious and the  most popular  fruit in the United States.
One cup (109 grams)  of apple slices with the skin provides 62 calories and almost 3 grams of dietary fiber.
Apples are not only low in calories but also a  good source of nutrients , such as vitamin C, Vitamin E, and zinc.

Onions  are low calorie vegetables that have been linked to a number of health benefits.
For example, research shows that following a diet high in vegetables in the allium family, such as onions and  garlic , may  reduce the risk  of certain health conditions like heart and kidney disease.
Even though the taste differs depending on the type, all onions have very few calories — a medium-sized, cooked onion (148 grams) has approximately  70 calories .

Water-rich foods
As its name suggests,  watermelon  is a very hydrating fruit. It tastes delicious on its own or paired with fresh mint and  feta cheese .
Watermelon is a good source of many nutrients, including vitamin C. There are  46 calories  in 1 cup (154 grams) of watermelon balls.

There are only  17 calories  in 1 cup (120 grams) of celery.
Cucumbers  are a refreshing vegetable commonly found in salads. They’re also used to flavor water along with fruits and herbs, and they can make a low calorie base for high protein dishes like chicken or tuna salad.
Since cucumbers are mostly water, they’re very low in calories — a half-cup (52 grams) has only  8 calories .
Iceberg lettuce  is known for its high water content. It’s commonly used in salads and on top of burgers or sandwiches.
Even though most people think it’s not as nutritious as  other types of lettuce , iceberg lettuce is a good source of some nutrients, including vitamin K, provitamin A, and folate.
One cup (57 grams) of iceberg lettuce has only  8 calories .

The bottom line
Many delicious foods are low in calories. Most of them are fruits and vegetables that also contain nutrients that benefit your health.
However, just because a food is lower in calories doesn’t mean it makes a better choice than higher calorie foods.  Your body needs adequate calories  on a daily basis to function optimally and help you feel your best.
It’s not a good idea to choose foods based simply on their calorie content. Instead, think about  choosing foods based on their nutrient density , or the amount of nutrients a food delivers in proportion to the calories it provides.
Eating a variety of lower calorie foods like fruits and vegetables alongside other foods that contain higher amounts of protein and fats (and thus calories) is a smart way to support optimal health.
Try this today : Being preoccupied with counting calories or restricting yourself to only low calorie foods isn’t healthy and can take a toll on your mental health.
If you think you may be overly concerned with calories and weight gain or are confused about how to maintain a healthful, guilt-free eating pattern, consider speaking with a qualified healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian or a therapist, for support.
