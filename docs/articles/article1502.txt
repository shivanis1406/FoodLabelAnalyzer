If you’re trying to lose weight or achieve another nutrition or fitness goal, a weight loss app may help. Research finds that consistently tracking calories and exercise is an effective strategy for weight management.
These weight loss apps download directly to your phone, offering a quick and easy way to log meals, workouts, and more.
Tracking behavior in this way can be enlightening, says Dr.  Janelle Duah , an obesity specialist at Yale Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, and an assistant professor of general medicine at Yale University Medical School.  “These features can open [peoples’] eyes to making healthier food choices, help them to recognize maladaptive patterns in their dietary habits, assist in them becoming aware of great choices they can be more consistent with, or even realize issues with inactivity or sedentary habits that need to be changed for overall health.”
According to health experts and users, here are the seven best weight loss apps.

What we like about it:  Noom  makes the nuts and bolts of weight loss (calories in/calories out) both educational and fun. It uses quizzes, humor, and very human language — some say it’s like talking with a nonjudgmental friend. But along the way, you can learn real and useful information about habit formation, how metabolism works, and what it actually takes to lose weight sensibly and keep it off.
It’s also backed by research.  One study  of more than 500 adults found that food and exercise logging, along with coaching through Noom, was more effective for weight loss over 6 months than food logging or personalized coaching alone.
A newer feature, Success Kit, provides support resources like grocery planning, healthy food swaps, workouts, and meditations.
How it works:  Using information you provide through a series of prompts, Noom generates a customized plan that includes a timeline for your weight loss goals, a suggested daily calorie range, and behavioral encouragements, such as helping you to understand the “why” behind your goal.
In addition to meal tracking (and tracking other things, like water consumption and activity), it offers nutritional guidance by sorting foods into colored categories (green, yellow, orange), and offers daily reading with quizzes. You can also get ideas for food substitutions and recipes.

Plus, you’ll have a health coach who can provide accountability and help you set realistic weekly goals to keep you on track.
Noom subscription costs range from $70 per month to $209 per year, with costs dropping for longer subscriptions.
Additionally, Noom offers a weight loss medication service, Noom Med, which costs $49 more per month, not including the cost of medication.
Considerations:  As a calorie-counting tool, Noom may not be the right fit for everyone. In some people, calorie counting can  increase the risk  of disordered eating. Plus, as our tester noted, the app may set your calorie goals too low (though you can adjust them).
Additionally, Noom’s color coding system may discourage consumption of higher calorie foods that are nonetheless nutritionally dense.


Healthline contributor and registered dietitian  Rachael Ajmera  shared her experience with Noom. She commented on how easy the app is to use and appreciated the level of support offered.
She also liked the daily lessons, noting, “I felt the daily lessons were simple and straightforward yet informative. Being able to select the amount of time you want to spend on these daily lessons is also very useful, especially for those who want to spend only a few minutes per day on the app.”
However, she wasn’t as impressed with the food tracking tool and the color-coding system. “When it came to logging my foods each day, I felt the food tracker tool was somewhat cumbersome and confusing. … Certain foods were categorized as green in one entry but yellow or orange (previously red) in others.”

Best for health coaching
Subscription cost   $24.99 per month
Supported devices   Apple, Android
iPhone rating   4.4
Android rating   4.4
Requires a monthly membership or subscription   yes

What we like about it:  Wellos is a relatively new app that prioritizes fostering a healthy relationship with food and overall wellness. The app particularly stands out for its helpful videos and one-on-one support from certified health coaches, many of whom have additional certifications.

Another notable feature is the ability to turn off  calorie tracking , which may be helpful for individuals who find that calorie counting damages their relationship with food.

How it works:  After choosing either the Weight Health or the Total Wellness journey, you’ll gain access to educational content and food and activity tracking.

The app’s learning content is delivered in bite-sized lessons, which are organized into phases within each journey. New users have access to foundational lessons during a 14-day trial, after which they can explore a full library of content, including videos and interactive elements.

Thousands of recipes are available with a subscription, including the ability to filter by cuisine, dish type, cooking appliances, diets, and more.

Considerations:  The app is only available in the United States, and its activity tracking and meal planning features aren’t currently as robust as what’s offered by some other apps, though this may change in the future. It’s also worth noting that the app is owned by RVO Health.

Best for community
Subscription cost   approximately $15–$65 per month
iPhone rating   4.8
Android rating   4.5
Requires a monthly membership or subscription   yes

What we like about it:  WeightWatchers places a big emphasis on community and social networking, plus 24/7 live coaching for accountability and support. This may help some people feel less alone in their weight loss journey.
“A platform where application users can ‘follow’ other users who were in similar situations as themselves, thus reducing feelings of isolation and overwhelm that people can often experience, can also be helpful,” Duah said.
Plus, no foods are off limits with  WeightWatchers , which uses a  points system  that’s based on nutrient content and calories. There’s also an extensive collection of recipes that you can search based on meal type and dietary requirements.
How it works:  Based on the results of your online quiz, you’ll get a daily PersonalPoints allotment and a customized list of zero-point foods.
Then you’re ready to start tracking points, logging workouts, and monitoring weight trends all in the app.

WeightWatchers offers three plans, all of which provide access to the company’s app. Depending on which plan you choose, WeightWatchers costs $10 to $55 per month, though the company frequently offers monthly discounts to new customers.
More recently, WeightWatchers launched WeightWatchers Clinic, which is a membership program that combines WeightWatchers’ signature Points program with prescription  weight loss medications.
The cost for WeightWatchers Clinic includes a $49 initial consultation fee, followed by $84 per month, plus the cost of medication.

Best for logging meals
Subscription cost   free, optional subscription for $9.99 per month or $39.99 per year
Requires a monthly membership or subscription   no
iPhone rating   4.8
Android rating   4.4

What we like about it:  The app is super user-friendly and has a huge database of more than 33 million foods, restaurant items, and brands. The Snap It feature makes logging a breeze by allowing you to simply take pictures of your meals.
There’s also a convenient barcode scanner and recipe builder, and it’ll save foods that you enter frequently to make logging even more efficient.
Taking pictures  of meals may help people keep track of portion sizes more accurately and observe trends in their dietary intake, both of which help promote weight loss, though overall, the  research is mixed .
We love the focus on  nonscale victories , such as lowering your  cholesterol levels  and feeling more energized, too.
How it works:  Lose It! generates your personalized weight loss plan through an analysis of your weight, age, and health goals. Then, you simply start logging and, if you’d like, take part in the challenges and forums within the app.
Using the app is free, but additional features are unlocked with a premium subscription for $39 annually.
Consideration:  Lose It! relies on food logging as a means of calorie counting, which has the potential to lead to a disordered relationship with food and body image in some people.

Best for intermittent fasting
Subscription cost   $9.99 month or $69.99 annual
iPhone rating   4.8
Android rating   4.6
Requires monthly membership or subscription   yes
What we like about it:  For anyone exploring  intermittent fasting  as a weight management strategy, Zero has all the bells and whistles you need to jump in, from educational resources to a customizable fasting timer, tracking capabilities, and statistics to monitor your progress.
How it works:  After signing up, users can get started with various  fasting methods  like 16:8, 5:2, or personalized schedules.
The premium app unlocks additional features such as expert guidance and advanced statistics for a more tailored fasting experience.
There is a free version of the app, but you can upgrade for additional features for $9.99 per month or $69.99 annually.
Consideration:  If you’re looking for nutritional guidance, this may not be the right app choice for you. Also keep in mind that intermittent fasting isn’t appropriate for everyone, including people who are pregnant and people with  type 1  diabetes on insulin.

Best for intuitive eating
Subscription cost   $6.99 per month or $49.99 per year
Requires a monthly membership or subscription   yes
iPhone rating   3.5
Android rating   N/A

What we like about it:  Maybe you’re tired of focusing so much on pounds or inches, and you just want to feel you have a healthier relationship with food.  Way  is a unique app that takes an antidiet approach to health through  mindful eating .
According to obesity specialist Dr.  Janelle Duah , for some people, apps that require tracking food, counting calories, and monitoring physical activity can have negative effects on their relationship with food and exercise.
Way’s emphasis on  intuitive eating  might be a fresh alternative.
It’s also worth noting that  some research  has found that actively dieting might actually make it more difficult to lose weight due to changes in the body’s metabolism, hunger, and fullness cues.
How it works:  When you first sign up, the app will ask you questions designed to help you reflect on how eating foods makes you feel. The goal is to foster a healthy relationship with those foods.
There are more than 60 different activities in the app that are broken down into three pathways:
The Emotional Eats Pathway:  This pathway reflects on how our emotions can affect our eating habits in a nonjudgmental way.
The Body Feels Pathway:  It observes body image as well as physical health overall.
The Mindful Shifts Pathway:  It asks questions about how we talk about ourselves when it comes to our lifestyle habits.



Overall, the reviews on the app are positive, with some calling it a safe space and a refreshing change to the traditional health apps out there. However, some have written reviews that mention the format of the app can be a bit buggy at times.
Way offers a free 14-day trial followed by a monthly cost of $6.99.
Consideration:  Way is not designed for weight loss but to help people have a better relationship with food and their bodies.

Best for grocery shopping
Subscription cost   free, optional in-app purchases costing $9.99–$89.99
Requires a monthly membership or subscription   no
iPhone rating   4.6
Android rating   4.2

What we like about it:  If you’re looking to make healthy choices on your next grocery run, this may be your answer. Fooducate’s easy-to-use scanner allows you to scan more than 250,000 product barcodes and receive detailed information about the food, flagging ingredients to look out for and even a list of healthier alternatives to purchase.
How it works:  All you need to do is download the app and allow it access to your phone’s camera. Then you can start scanning your products.
If your product contains less healthy ingredients, such as  trans fats  and  high fructose corn syrup , it will flag them for you and help you choose another product.
For example, if you scan a specific type of  yogurt  that contains a high amount of  added sugar , the app will show you lower sugar options to look for instead.

It’s free to download, but certain features, such as  micronutrient  tracking and potential food allergy warnings, require a premium app subscription ($6.99 per month).
Consideration:  Assigning grades to foods may lead to a disordered relationship with food in some people.

Comparing weight loss apps

How we chose the best weight loss apps
Vetting:  All the apps on our list have been vetted to ensure that they meet Healthline’s  medical and business standards .
Ratings:  We chose apps with mostly positive ratings to find the best weight loss apps for both iPhone and Android users.
Features:  We recognize that weight loss is a highly personalized process. The weight loss apps included on our list have a range of features to suit a variety of needs, such as community challenges, food tracking, and personal coaching.
Weight loss approach:  It’s important to have realistic expectations and maintain (or foster) a  healthy relationship with food  and your body. We chose apps that support realistic weight loss goals and encourage a whole-body approach.
Expert recommended:  All the apps below have been recommended by nutrition experts. We’ve also included expert insights on the effectiveness of weight loss apps from Dr. Janelle Duah of Yale University.
Cost:  We’ve included both free and paid weight loss apps to meet various budgets.

How to choose the best weight loss app
When deciding which weight loss app is right for you, there are a few factors to keep in mind, such as:
Budget:  Many weight loss apps have a free version as well as the option to access premium features for an additional cost. Others require a subscription or a one-time purchase for use.
Special features:  Adherence is the most important thing when it comes to successful weight loss, so consider what features will help you stick with it. While most research supports  food logging  as the most effective tool, you may find other features, such as one-on-one coaching, meal planning, and recipes, helpful as well, depending on your needs and preferences. Some apps can also sync to a wearable device, such as a  fitness watch , to make activity tracking seamless and convenient.
Weight and wellness goals:  Certain apps may be better suited for certain goals. For example, if your goal is to lose weight by increasing your activity level, it’s helpful to choose an app that offers recommended workouts and integrates with an activity tracker.
Your experience level:  If you’re new to exercising and healthy eating, you’ll want an app that includes plenty of beginner-level resources or even one-on-one coaching.

Are weight loss apps effective?
A  2023 review  found that weight loss apps are just as effective as traditional programs in helping individuals lose weight. This might be partly due to the types of resources many weight loss apps offer, including goal tracking, social support, and educational content.
That said, the review also found that using weight loss apps was just as effective as logging food with a simple pen and paper. So it may be the logging — rather than the actual apps — that makes the biggest difference.
Many weight loss apps, like Noom, WeightWatchers, and Wellos, offer additional features like behavior modification techniques, community support, and personalized coaching. However,  research  on the effectiveness of these features is limited.
Ultimately,  success with a weight loss app  depends on the user’s engagement, consistency, and commitment to making sustainable lifestyle changes. It’s also worth noting that individual preferences play a role as well.

Limitations of weight loss apps
While weight loss apps may be an effective tool for some, they aren’t foolproof and may not be accessible for everyone. “Using the apps takes a considerable amount of technological savvy, so may be hard for older or less tech-experienced people to gain benefit from consistent use,” said Duah.
Subscription costs can also be a barrier for some people to use weight loss apps, especially over longer periods of time.
Ultimately, Duah said, the person who will most benefit from a weight loss app “will be technologically capable, can afford to use it consistently, and is invested in their own weight management, engaged in the application which caters to their specific needs, and has dietary, psychological, and physical support when needed.”

Losing 20 pounds  in a month is a goal that’s not recommended due to health concerns.
Rapid weight loss  can lead to a range of issues, including muscle loss and nutritional deficiencies, and can negatively affect your overall health. It’s also unsustainable and can set you up for potential weight regain.
A healthier and more sustainable approach to weight loss involves setting realistic goals, focusing on gradual, steady weight loss – typically 0.5 to 2 pounds per week, as recommended by health professionals. This can be achieved through a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and lifestyle changes that promote overall well-being.
It’s always best to consult with a healthcare professional like a dietitian for personalized advice and safe weight management strategies.

The best weight loss program is one that aligns with your personal health goals, preferences, and lifestyle.
For example, Wellos may be the best option for someone looking for 1:1 coaching, an interactive curriculum, and dietary tracking. In contrast, WeightWatchers may be an ideal program for someone looking for a community-oriented approach with its vast support network.
Ultimately, the effectiveness of a weight loss program depends on  consistent engagement  with it and the ability to incorporate its principles into your daily life.

Both MyFitnessPal and LoseIt! are popular weight loss apps that can be effective tools on your health journey. Both apps have large food databases, however, users can enter their own food into the database in MyFitnessPal, which opens the door for a lot of incorrect entries. For that reason, LoseIt! gets our vote for the better option.

MyFitnessPal can definitely work. The app has a large food database to help you track your meals and support your weight loss goals. However, as with any of the weight loss apps on our list, it has to be a program that feels sustainable and you can stick with in order for it to work.

Bottom line
If you’re looking to lose weight, an app can help support your diet and weight loss goals, offering tools in the palm of your hand. On the flip side, weight loss apps can also be time consuming, expensive, and problematic for your mental well-being.
Many apps offer a free version or free trial, so you might try experimenting with a few to see which one, if any, works best for you.
