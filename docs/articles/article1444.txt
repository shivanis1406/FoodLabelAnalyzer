Title: 7 Healthy Substitutes for Lard

Lard is a type of semisolid fat that’s widely used in baking and cooking to give foods a rich flavor and creamy texture.
However, it’s also high in saturated fat and made from pork, a meat that people may choose not to consume for religious or dietary reasons ( 1 ).
Fortunately, you can find plenty of healthy alternatives to lard that can be used in just about any recipe.
Here are 7 simple substitutes for lard.

1. Butter
Butter may be the simplest substitute for lard.
With some minor modifications to your recipe, butter can help retain the taste and texture of your final product. This makes butter a great option for pie crusts, tortillas, tamale dough, and more.
Because butter contains slightly less fat than lard, you may need to use a bit more to achieve the same results.
For each cup (205 grams) of lard, you should use approximately 1 1/4 cups (284 grams) of  butter .
If you’re watching your weight, be sure to opt for unsalted varieties of butter whenever it’s possible in your recipe.
You can use 1 1/4 cup (284 grams) of butter for each cup (205 grams) of lard, which can help retain the taste and texture of many different recipes.

2. Coconut oil
Coconut oil is a tropical oil that has been linked to some  health benefits .
In fact, some research suggests that coconut oil may be especially beneficial for heart health, reducing levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol ( 2 ).
You can swap equal amounts of  coconut oil  for lard in many recipes, especially when baking, grilling, or pan-frying foods.
Note that unrefined coconut oil tends to have a strong coconut taste and aroma, so it may slightly change the flavor of certain dishes.
You can substitute an equal amount of coconut oil for lard in recipes, especially when baking, grilling, or pan-frying foods.

3. Vegetable oils
Vegetable oils  are often used in cooking and baking.
Cooks and pastry chefs often opt for these oils for their high smoke point, which is the temperature at which an oil starts to burn and smoke ( 3 ).
This also makes vegetable oils especially beneficial as a replacement for lard when using high heat cooking methods like frying, grilling, and sautéing.
Try using about 7/8 cup (191 mL) of vegetable oil for each cup (205 grams) of lard in your favorite recipes.
Keep in mind that baked goods like cookies and cakes may be denser and less tender if you use oil instead of lard. Additionally, for recipes like  tortillas , adding some water with the oil can help improve the texture.
For each cup (205 grams) of lard in a recipe, you can use 7/8 cup (191 mL) of vegetable oil. This works especially well for frying, grilling, and sautéing, as well as baking, although it may slightly alter the texture and consistency.

4. Olive oil
Rich in antioxidants and  monounsaturated fats , olive oil can give your recipes a heart-healthy twist when used in place of lard ( 4 ).
It can also be used instead of lard at a 1:1 ratio, making it one of the most simple substitutes available.
However, using this oil instead of lard alters the texture of certain dishes and may give foods a subtle olive-like flavor.
Olive oil  and its savory flavor may be better suited for grilling, frying, or sautéing rather than baked goods and sweets.
Olive oil can be used in place of lard at a 1:1 ratio and is a great option for recipes that are grilled, fried, or sautéed.

5. Avocado
Known for their mild flavor and creamy texture,  avocados  can boost the fat content and flavor of your favorite recipes.
They’re also rich in a variety of important nutrients, including potassium, folate, and vitamins C and K ( 5 ).
Avocados work particularly well for baked goods, including cakes, cookies,  muffins , or breads.
If your recipe calls for 1 cup (205 grams) of lard, you should typically use about 1/2 cup (115 grams) of mashed avocado, although you may need to adjust the ratio a bit as needed.
Remember that using avocado in place of other types of fat can change the color, texture, and taste of your final product, which may not be ideal for certain recipes like pie crusts or tortillas.
For each cup (205 grams) of lard found in baked goods like cookies, cakes, breads, and muffins, you can use about 1/2 cup (115 grams) of avocado.

6. Beef tallow
Beef tallow is a type of rendered fat that has been cooked down to remove any impurities.
It’s a good source of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and contains several  fat-soluble vitamins , including vitamins A, D, and E ( 6 ).
You can also use an equal amount of beef tallow in place of lard in many recipes without significantly changing the final product.
Beef tallow does tend to have a richer, meatier flavor than lard. As such, it may be a better choice for fried or grilled savory dishes rather than baked goods.
Beef tallow can be used in place of lard in equal amounts in many grilled or fried dishes.

7. Mashed banana
Mashed bananas are a great substitute for lard, helping you cut down on the calorie content of many recipes while squeezing in some extra nutrients.
In particular, this  fruit  is high in potassium, fiber, and vitamins B6 and C ( 7 ).
Try using 1/2 cup (113 grams) of mashed  bananas  for each cup (205 grams) of lard in baked goods like breads, cakes, and muffins.
However, keep in mind that mashed bananas won’t work well as a cooking oil or in savory dishes.
Additionally, you may need to adjust some of the other ingredients in your recipe to compensate for the natural sweetness of bananas.
You can use 1/2 cup (113 grams) of mashed banana for each cup (205 grams) of lard in baked goods like breads, cakes, and muffins.
