Title: Why Am I So Tired? 12 Reasons (Plus Solutions)

Not getting enough sleep is one reason why you may be tired. Other possible reasons include nutrient deficiencies, stress, an underlying health condition, and drug side effects. If you have chronic fatigue, see a doctor for a diagnosis.
If you’re feeling overly tired or have little energy, you’re not alone.
Fatigue may be caused by simple factors like a lack of sleep or coming down with a cold or the flu. However, it can also be caused by underlying health conditions.
In most cases, fatigue can be remedied by lifestyle or dietary modifications, correcting a nutrient deficiency, or treating an underlying medical condition. Still, to improve fatigue, you need to get to the bottom of what’s causing it.
Here are 12 potential reasons why you’re always tired.

Not getting enough high quality sleep
Getting enough sleep is essential for overall health. Unfortunately, many of us don’t get enough, which may lead to fatigue.
During sleep, your body performs a  number of critical processes , including releasing important growth hormones and repairing and regenerating cells. This is why most people wake up feeling refreshed, alert, and energized after a night of  high quality sleep .
Even though sleep time should be individualized adults should get at least  7 hours of sleep per night  for optimal health.
Insomnia is a term for any condition that causes difficulty falling or staying asleep. It can have several causes, including menopause, medical conditions, psychological stress, poor sleeping environments, and excessive mental stimulation.
If you’re experiencing insomnia,  treatments  like natural supplements, medications, and the management of underlying medical conditions may help. Visit your doctor to get the appropriate care and treatment.

Deficiencies
Nutrient deficiencies  may lead you to feel exhausted on a daily basis, even if you’re getting more than 7 hours of sleep.
Deficiencies in the  following nutrients  have been linked to fatigue:
iron
riboflavin (vitamin B2)
niacin  (vitamin B3)
pantothenic acid  (vitamin B5)
pyridoxine (vitamin B6)
folate  (vitamin B9)
vitamin B12
vitamin D
vitamin C
magnesium
If you are experiencing fatigue, discuss with your healthcare professional if it is necessary to test for deficiencies. Typically, fatigue related to a deficiency in one or more nutrients improves once your nutrient levels normalize.

Stress
Although some stress is normal, chronic stress can  lead to fatigue . In fact, chronic stress may lead to stress-related exhaustion disorder (ED), a medical condition characterized by psychological and physical symptoms of exhaustion.
Furthermore, chronic stress may cause structural and functional changes in your brain and lead to chronic inflammation, contributing to symptoms like fatigue.
A therapist may also help you develop strategies to reduce stress. Many health insurance plans cover mental health counseling, and virtual therapy is also an option.

Underlying medical conditions
If you’re experiencing unexplained, chronic fatigue, you should visit your doctor and discuss your symptoms.
They may recommend testing  to rule out  certain health conditions that cause fatigue, such as:
sleep apnea
hypothyroidism
cancer
chronic fatigue syndrome
multiple sclerosis
anxiety disorders
kidney disease
depression
diabetes
fibromyalgia
It’s important to know that it’s abnormal to feel exhausted constantly. If you experience frequent fatigue, there are likely one or more causes.
Getting proper treatment for an underlying medical condition can help you feel better and improve other areas of health as well.

Poor diet
Your diet significantly affects the way you feel.
To maintain energy and get the nutrients your body needs to perform critical processes, it’s important to consume a balanced diet high in  nutrient-dense foods .
When you don’t obtain enough calories and nutrients like protein, your body breaks down fat and muscle to meet energy demands. This leads to losing body fat and muscle mass, which  may trigger  fatigue.
Additionally, diets high in  ultra-processed foods  impair energy levels. For example, a diet high in added sugar may harm sleep and lead to chronically high blood sugar and insulin levels, resulting in fatigue.
Following a diet low in ultra-processed food and added sugar but rich in nutrient-dense foods like fruits, veggies, legumes, and  healthy protein sources  may help reduce fatigue and support healthy sleep while providing your body with optimal nutrition.

Consuming too much caffeine
Although caffeinated beverages like coffee and energy drinks feel like they boost energy, over-reliance on them may make you more tired the next day. That’s because too much caffeine can harm sleep, which may cause fatigue.
Research shows that feeling tired in the morning leads people to consume large amounts of caffeine, which impairs their sleep cycle. In turn, you may overuse coffee or other caffeinated drinks for energy, which continues the  cycle of poor sleep  followed by too much caffeine.
While coffee and caffeinated beverages like green tea may benefit health when consumed in moderation,  energy drinks  are extremely high in stimulants and added sugar. Thus, you should avoid them whenever possible.
If you’re currently experiencing sleep issues and frequently drink caffeinated beverages, try cutting back to see whether it helps improve your sleep and energy levels.

Inadequate hydration
Staying hydrated is important for maintaining energy levels. The many biochemical reactions that take place in your body every day result in a loss of water that needs to be replaced.
Dehydration occurs when you don’t drink enough liquid to replace the water lost in your urine, stools, sweat, and breath. Being dehydrated  leads to lower energy levels  and decreased concentration ability.
Although you may have heard that you should drink eight 8-ounce (240-mL)  glasses of water daily , hydration needs depend on several factors, including your weight, age, sex, and activity levels.
The key is drinking enough to maintain good hydration. Common  symptoms of dehydration  include thirst, fatigue,  dizziness , and  headaches .

Overweight or obesity
Maintaining a  healthy body weight  is essential to overall health.
Not only is obesity significantly linked to a greater risk of many chronic illnesses like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers, but it may also increase your risk of chronic fatigue.
Obesity greatly increases your risk of obstructive sleep apnea, which is a common cause of daytime fatigue. It’s also linked to increased daytime sleepiness regardless of sleep apnea, suggesting that obesity directly affects the sleep cycle.
Maintaining a healthy body weight may support good sleep and energy levels, while getting high quality sleep may help prevent weight gain and reduce fatigue.

Other causes of fatigue
Many other conditions may lead to tiredness. It’s important to understand that several factors may contribute to your exhaustion.
Here are a few other common reasons why you may feel tired:
Drug and alcohol dependence:  People who are dependent on drugs or  alcohol  are more likely to experience fatigue.
Shift work:  Shift work causes sleep disruption and may result in fatigue.
A sedentary lifestyle:  Leading a  sedentary lifestyle  may lead to tiredness during the day. Exercising in the day can decrease overall fatigue.
Certain medications:  Some drugs, including steroids, blood pressure medications, and antidepressants, are linked to side effects like insomnia and increased tiredness.
If you need help overcoming your addiction contact the  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline  at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).

The bottom line
Even though everyone has days when they feel exhausted, constantly feeling run down and tired isn’t normal.
Many possible factors cause chronic fatigue, such as underlying medical conditions, nutrient deficiencies, sleep disturbances, caffeine intake, and chronic stress.
If you’re experiencing unexplained fatigue, you must talk with your doctor to find the cause.
In many cases, your fatigue should improve once you identify the underlying cause(s) and make appropriate lifestyle and dietary adjustments — or get the right treatment for medical conditions.

You know your body best and know when something isn’t right. If you’re feeling chronically exhausted even when you get adequate rest, there may be a medical condition contributing to your fatigue.
Work with a doctor you trust to get the right testing to rule out common health conditions that may be contributing to your fatigue.
