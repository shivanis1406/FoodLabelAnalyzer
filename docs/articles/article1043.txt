Blood oranges are citrus fruits often known for their vibrant color and dark, crimson flesh.
They get their unique hue from certain compounds known as anthocyanins, including chrysanthemin ( 1 ).
Thanks to rich reserves of essential antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, this flavorful fruit has even been linked to several powerful health benefits.
Here are 7 potential benefits of blood oranges, along with a few tips on adding them to your diet.

2. May promote weight loss
Blood oranges may be a great addition to a healthy weight loss diet.
Not only are blood oranges low in calories, they’re also high in fiber, with 3 grams in each serving ( 2 ).
Fiber  passes through the digestive tract very slowly, helping you stay full longer by prolonging the digestion in your stomach ( 7 ).
Some research also suggests that adding more citrus fruits to your diet may be beneficial for weight loss, if that’s your goal.
A 24-year study including more than 133,000 adults associated eating more citrus fruits with increased weight loss ( 8 ).
Another review of 13 studies concluded that citrus fruits and their extracts may be effective in losing weight ( 9 ).
Blood oranges are low in calories and high in fiber, which can help increase feelings of fullness. Some research also shows that eating more citrus fruits may be beneficial for weight loss.

3. May support healthy pregnancy
Blood oranges contain several nutrients that are important for promoting proper growth and development during your  pregnancy .
Folate , for example, is necessary to prevent neural tube defects and other birth defects ( 10 ).
Vitamin C is also crucial during pregnancy. One study in 1,138 women reported that increased intake of vitamin C or fruits and vegetables mid-pregnancy was linked to improved fetal and infant growth up to 6 months of age ( 11 ).
Additionally, fiber may help prevent several issues during pregnancy, including diabetes, constipation, and preeclampsia ( 12 ,  13 ).
Interestingly enough, some studies have also found that eating more citrus fruits during pregnancy may also be beneficial for children later in life.
For instance, one study showed that children of mothers who ate more citrus fruits during pregnancy were less likely to experience hyperactivity and emotional and behavioral concerns during childhood ( 14 ).
Blood oranges contain several nutrients that are important during pregnancy. Eating more citrus fruits while pregnant may also be beneficial for children later in life.

4. May boost immune function
With a hearty dose of vitamin C packed into each serving, blood oranges may help ramp up  immune function , protecting you from illness and infection.
In fact, studies show that supplementing your diet with vitamin C may help reduce the duration of upper respiratory infections, diminish their severity, and even improve outcomes for severe infections ( 15 ,  16 ).
Plus, blood oranges contain a variety of antioxidants.  Antioxidants  are compounds that may help neutralize harmful free radicals to reduce inflammation and prevent cell damage in your body.
What’s more, antioxidants may also protect you against many chronic conditions, including type 2 diabetes, cancer, and heart disease ( 17 ,  18 ).
Blood oranges are high in vitamin C and antioxidants, both of which can support immune health.

5. May improve gut health
Blood oranges are a great source of fiber, boasting nearly 3 grams in a single serving ( 2 ).
Fiber can soften and add bulk to stool — this promotes your regularity and  prevents constipation  ( 7 ,  19 ).
Fiber may also be beneficial for the treatment of several other conditions, including hemorrhoids and diverticulitis ( 7 ,  20 ).
Adding more fiber into your diet can also help improve the health of the  gut microbiome , which is the community of beneficial bacteria found in your digestive tract ( 21 ,  22 ).
Research shows that the gut microbiome plays a key role in many aspects of health, including digestion, immune function, heart health, and more ( 23 ).
Blood oranges are a good source of fiber, which can promote regularity and enhance the health of the gut microbiome.

6. May have cancer-fighting properties
Blood oranges are rich in cancer-fighting antioxidants like chrysanthemin, the compound that gives the fruit its distinct color.
In one test-tube study, chrysanthemin prevented the growth and spread of prostate cancer cells ( 24 ).
Other antioxidants found in blood oranges have also been shown to have  anti-cancer effects , including caffeic, ferulic, and coumaric acids ( 25 ,  26 ,  27 ,  28 ,  29 ). It’s important to note, however, that these findings were in test tube studies of cell, and more studies including humans are needed.
Studies also show that eating more citrus fruits may be associated with a lower risk of several types of cancer, including lung, stomach, and oral cancers ( 30 ,  31 ,  32 ).
Still, more studies are needed to understand how blood oranges may affect cancer development in humans when eaten in typical amounts.
Some of the compounds found in blood oranges have been shown to decrease cancer cell growth in test tube studies. Eating more citrus fruits may also be linked to a lower risk of certain types of cancer.

7. Versatile and delicious
Blood oranges have a slightly sweet, tart, and tangy flavor that works well in a variety of recipes.
From cakes and panna cottas to  ice creams  and sorbets, blood oranges make a great addition to many desserts.
You can also use blood oranges to brighten up  salads  or add a tasty twist to cocktails, juices, and mixed drinks.
