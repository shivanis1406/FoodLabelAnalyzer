Many athletes and avid exercisers rely on electrolyte powders to replenish their electrolytes and hydration after workouts.
But with so many electrolyte powders on the market, it can be difficult to know which one is right for you.
After reviewing more than 30 products, Healthline writers and sports dietitians  Katey Davidson , MScFN, RD, CPT, and  Ellen Landes , MS, RDN, CPT, along with our medical vetting team, narrowed down the options to the eight best (plus a few honorable mentions).

Bare Performance Nutrition Electrolytes is our pick for the best overall electrolyte powder thanks to its Safe for Sport certification, relatively affordable price, and simple ingredients list.

This product focuses solely on replenishing electrolytes that are often lost through sweat, such as sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, and calcium, rather than adding a bunch of other nutrients and ingredients that you may or may not need.

Just keep in mind that it contains 500 milligrams (mg) of sodium, or 22% of the daily value (DV). While it’s important to get  enough sodium , 500 mg is probably too much unless you’re doing  high intensity exercise  or being exposed to high temperatures.

The powder is sugar-free and sweetened with stevia, which may be a good option for people who aren’t doing long-distance exercise, following the ketogenic diet, or trying to limit added sugars.

While it’s available in only three flavors, online reviews are almost entirely positive. Most reviewers say this product tastes great and isn’t too sweet.

Finally, a major benefit of Bare Performance Nutrition Electrolytes is that it’s certified by Informed Sport, which means it has been third-party tested to ensure it’s free of substances banned by most sport organizations.

Gnarly Hydrate came close to being the best overall product, thanks to its great electrolyte profile and NSF Safe for Sport certification.

According to Davidson, “From personal experience, I found Gnarly Nutrition to be one of the better-tasting electrolyte powders on the market. It’s not too sweet, salty, or artificial tasting, which is common for some electrolyte powders. Also, they have a few flavors to choose from.”
However, it does contain 4 grams (g) of  added sugar  per serving. While simple sugars are helpful for endurance athletes, others may prefer a product that is free of or lower in sugar.

The powder is available in three flavors and comes in both 40-serving bags and individual stick travel packs.

Nuun Sport Hydration tablets are an excellent choice if you prefer tablets over powders. In addition to being more compact, tablets are useful when you’re on the go because you can quickly pop one into your water bottle without needing to stop and measure out a scoop.

The tablets come in 14 flavors — 9 non-caffeinated and 5 caffeinated. The caffeinated tablets provide 40 mg of caffeine from organic  green tea extract .

Caffeine is a popular and approved  performance enhancer . It can help improve cognitive and physical performance during exercise. But it’s worth noting that  most benefits  of caffeine are found with doses higher than the dose in Nuun tablets.

Nuun Sport Hydration contains just 1 g of added sugar per serving and relies on stevia to enhance its flavor. Davidson noted, “I found Nuun tablets to be the least sweet of the powders I tried.”

If you’re a competitive athlete, you can rest assured: Nuun Sport Hydration tablets are Informed Sport certified.

Cure Hydrating Drink Mix is made of all-natural, organic ingredients, relying on coconut water powder as its primary source of electrolytes.

While it also contains pink Himalayan salt, the sodium levels are relatively modest, making it more suitable for everyday hydration or moderate exercise, rather than recovery from intense physical exertion.

Cure Hydrating Drink Mix doesn’t have any added sugar but is sweetened with stevia and monk fruit and comes in a variety of flavors, like Strawberry Kiwi, Lemon, Watermelon, and more. As with most products using stevia, it’s worth noting that it does contain the distinct stevia aftertaste, which some people may dislike.

If you’re looking for a low cost electrolyte powder, Zeal Naturals Enhanced Electrolytes Powder is a good option.
At just $0.35 per serving (depending on where you purchase it), it’s much more affordable than many other electrolyte powders, which usually cost $0.75 or more per serving.

In addition to electrolytes, the powder contains added  branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)  and  zinc  to further  support  workout recovery.

Zeal Naturals Enhanced Electrolytes Powder is available in a variety of flavors, making it easy to find one you like. While the powder is free of added sugar, it does contain stevia. Some online reviewers say this makes the powder too sweet.

Another potential downside is the lack of third-party testing for substances banned by many sporting organizations. As a result, this product isn’t a good option for competitive athletes.

If you prefer to avoid added sugars and artificial sweeteners, Skratch Everyday Drink Mix is worth considering.

The powder comes in two flavors, both of which are carb-free and provide just 10 calories per serving, plus some electrolytes.

Carbohydrates are important for fuel and hydration. While the powder can be a good option for everyday hydration, Skratch Everyday Drink Mix isn’t the best choice for athletes, unless you’re consuming carbs along with the drink.

If you’re looking to support your energy levels during a long run or another long-distance endurance workout, this product from Skratch Labs might be a good option. Unlike the other Skratch Labs mix, it contains added sugar.

In addition to a good mixture of electrolytes to help replenish what you’ll lose through sweat, the 19 g of added sugar provides  important fuel during prolonged exercise .

During long-distance endurance workouts, glycogen stores — your muscles’ main energy source — begin to deplete. Consuming simple sugars  sends energy  quickly to your working muscles to help keep you performing at your best.

The powder is available in six flavors, one of which is caffeinated.

Reviewers rave about the powder’s delicious flavor.

Just keep in mind that because it isn’t certified Safe for Sport by Informed Sport or NSF, it might not be a good option for competitive athletes.

If you’re looking for an electrolyte powder with an added energy boost, Tailwind Nutrition Endurance Fuel is worth considering.

The powder is available in four caffeinated flavors, each of which contains 35 mg of caffeine per serving. Caffeine is a well-known ergogenic aid, meaning it helps support athletic performance.

Specifically, caffeine has been  shown  to  enhance athletic performance  in most sports, including endurance and strength-based activities.

Further, this product contains 25 g of added sugar, which can support athletic performance during endurance events, such as marathons. This is similar to the Skratch Labs Hydration Sport Drink Mix, though that product doesn’t contain the added caffeine.

Just keep in mind it’s not certified Safe for Sport, so it might not be a good option for competitive athletes.

The powder is also available in four non-caffeinated varieties: Mandarin, Lemon, Berry, and Naked (unflavored).

Other electrolyte powders we considered
While they’re not the best fit for everyone, the following products may be good options for those with specific needs:
With 1,000 mg of sodium per serving, the  LMNT  powder is formulated for prolonged exercise in high heat and for those who are known to lose more sodium through sweat than others. It also offers a straightforward ingredient list, free from sugars and artificial flavors and is available in multiple flavors.
BODYARMOR Flash I.V.  may be a good option. Each bottle contains 530 mg of sodium per serving, along with potassium and magnesium.
Just keep in mind that it’s fortified with several vitamins, so it may not be appropriate if you’re taking other dietary supplements. It also contains 15 g of added sugar, which may be too much if you’re not engaging in strenuous or endurance exercise.
DripDrop  is a great choice, with a wide array of flavors, including sugar-sweetened and sugar-free options, many of which can be purchased in variety packs. The mix was originally designed for treating severe hydration and offers 9 g of carbs and 330 mg of sodium. However, it’s become popular with athletes as well.
The powder is also NSF Certified for Sport, making it a good option for competitive athletes. While most reviews on DripDrop are positive, some customers comment that it can be overly sweet.
In addition to electrolytes,  Thorne Catalyte  contains 500 mg of taurine, an amino acid that may help support athletic performance and recovery, though research is mixed. It also provides B vitamins, zinc, and vitamin C.
Thorne is known for producing high quality supplements, and Catalyte electrolyte powder is NSF Certified for Sport, which means it’s a suitable option for competitive athletes. While the powder gets good reviews on taste, some reviewers note the lack of flavor options as a downside.

What are electrolyte powders?
Electrolyte powders are most commonly associated with athletes and avid exercisers. These powders are designed to replenish lost  electrolytes  that can occur with sweating or during certain illnesses.
Sodium is the main electrolyte and mineral lost through sweat, so most electrolyte powders focus mainly on replenishing it. Sodium  also helps  support fluid retention, allowing you to stay more hydrated during physical activity.
Potassium, magnesium, calcium, and chloride are other electrolytes you’ll often see in electrolyte supplements since they’re also lost through sweat, though in smaller amounts.
Electrolyte powders may also contain other ingredients to support athletic performance, such as caffeine, amino acids, and simple sugars.
Additionally, depending on the product and its marketed use, electrolyte powders may be fortified with essential nutrients or contain proprietary blends with ingredients such as antioxidants, herbs,  adaptogens , or other potential health-promoting compounds.

Who are electrolyte powders for?
For the average person, electrolyte powders are often unnecessary, especially if you’re consuming a nutritionally adequate diet.
Instead, electrolyte powders are often recommended for athletes who do vigorous physical activity for long periods — typically 60 to 90 minutes or longer — and are at  risk  of dehydration and sodium loss due to excessive sweating.
An electrolyte powder may also benefit people who:
sweat excessively  (this may be described as salty sweat, which causes visible white sweat stains on clothing)
spend a lot of time in hot outdoor environments
have physically demanding jobs, such as roofing and landscaping
are experiencing ongoing vomiting, diarrhea, or both due to an illness
Because high alcohol intake can lead to fluid losses through vomiting, increased urination, and other factors, some people may find an electrolyte powder helpful if they’re experiencing a  hangover .
Ultimately, electrolyte powders are useful for anyone experiencing fluid loss and looking for a quick way to replenish lost electrolytes.

How do you use electrolyte powders?
Most electrolyte powders come in a container with a scoop or in single-use packets. In some cases, they’re also available in tablet form.
Though instructions vary, most electrolyte powders can be stirred into water and consumed immediately.
Depending on the intended use, the manufacturer may provide specific dosing instructions.

How to choose an electrolyte powder
Which electrolyte powder to purchase depends on your intended use, goals, and preferences. Additional factors to consider include:
Form:  Depending on your preferences and ease of use, you may wish to purchase an electrolyte powder in a container with a scoop, in single packets, or in tablet form.
Price:  When deciding whether an electrolyte powder fits your budget, be sure to consider the cost per serving. Additionally, some companies offer discounts if you buy in bulk or sign up for a subscription.
Third-party testing for sport:  If you’re an athlete competing in high level sports, you may want to make sure your electrolyte powder is certified Safe for Sport.  Informed Sport  and  NSF Certified for Sport  are third-party testing companies that ensure products are free of substances that are banned by major sporting organizations.
Sodium content:  Sodium is the main electrolyte lost through sweat, so you should aim to replace sodium during periods of excessive sweating.
Other electrolytes:  Potassium, calcium, and magnesium are additional electrolytes lost in smaller amounts through sweat. Therefore, powders containing small amounts of these nutrients may be beneficial.
Sugar content:  If you’re doing endurance training (such as long-distance running, cycling, or hiking), you may benefit from products that are high in simple carbs in the form of sugar to  fuel your exercise . However, for non-endurance training, you likely don’t need a powder with a large amount of sugar.
Other ingredients:  Depending on your preferences and exercise goals, you may wish to include or avoid certain ingredients, such as natural sweeteners (like  stevia or monk fruit ), artificial sweeteners (like sucralose), caffeine, B vitamins, amino acids, and artificial colors or flavors, just to name a few.

While there are many great electrolyte powders, the most effective electrolyte powder will contain a good mixture of sodium and potassium to help replenish lost electrolytes through sweat. Our top pick is  Bare Performance Nutrition Electrolytes .
Another factor to consider is the length of the activity. If you’re doing any long-distance endurance activity, then you may want to take an electrolyte powder that also has added carbohydrates in the form of sugar, since these will provide your muscles with quick energy to support your performance.
If you’re a competitive athlete, then it’s best to look for an electrolyte powder that is Informed Sport certified or NSF certified, meaning it is third-party tested and doesn’t contain any banned substances by various sports organizations.
Beyond this, the best electrolyte is one that you enjoy and fits your budget.

The bottom line
Electrolyte powders can be helpful during strenuous exercise or other times when you’re sweating a lot.
When selecting an electrolyte powder, be sure to consider the ingredients, nutritional profile, flavor options, cost, and third-party certifications to determine which product is best for you.
Keep in mind that you might not need to take an electrolyte powder every day or at all. It’s best to talk with a healthcare professional before adding an electrolyte powder to your wellness and  exercise routine .
