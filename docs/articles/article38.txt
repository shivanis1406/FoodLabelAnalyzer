Healthline’s picks of the best diets for athletes
The  Mediterranean diet  is modeled after the traditional diet of countries like Italy, Spain, and Greece.
It limits processed foods and encourages you to eat fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, along with heart-healthy fats like  olive oil , nuts, and seeds.
These foods are rich in many nutrients that are especially important for athletes, including iron, magnesium, and calcium ( 1 ).
What’s more, some studies have also found that following the Mediterranean diet may be linked to improvements in athletic performance and physical fitness ( 2 ,  3 ).
For more information about the Mediterranean diet, including meal plans and recipes, check out “The Mediterranean Diet Cookbook for Beginners.”

Also sometimes referred to as semi-vegetarianism, the  flexitarian diet  is focused on plant-based foods like fruits, veggies, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds.
However, unlike vegan or vegetarian diets, it also allows moderate amounts of animal products like meat, fish, and poultry.
According to one review, plant-based diets could help improve body composition, enhance blood flow, decrease inflammation, and increase storage of glycogen, which is a type of carbohydrate found in the muscles that can be used as a quick source of energy ( 4 ).
Because it’s less strict than typical vegetarian diets, it may also be easier to meet your protein needs to boost muscle growth when you pair it with resistance training ( 5 ).
It can also help reduce several risk factors of heart disease. This could be especially beneficial for men because they may be at a higher risk of developing heart problems ( 6 ,  7 ,  8 ).

The  Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet  is a heart-healthy eating plan originally developed by the National Institutes of Health.
The diet promotes nutrient-dense whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and low fat dairy.
Not only is the DASH diet well rounded and rich in important nutrients, but it may also be especially beneficial for female athletes, who are typically at a higher risk of developing bone disorders like  osteopenia  and osteoporosis ( 9 ).
In fact, the DASH diet encourages followers to eat foods high in calcium, such as low fat dairy, to promote bone health. Studies have shown the DASH diet may help increase bone density ( 10 ,  11 ).

The  paleo diet  is based on the presumed eating patterns of ancient hunter-gatherers during the Paleolithic era.
The diet is rich in animal proteins, fruits, veggies, and healthy fats but eliminates processed foods, grains, legumes, sugar, and most dairy products.
Because the diet is typically high in  protein , it may be a good option to help increase muscle growth when combined with strength training ( 12 ).
Multiple studies have even shown that eating high amounts of protein may reduce fat mass and improve body composition ( 13 ,  14 ,  15 ).
If you find that the paleo diet is too strict or difficult to follow, there are also several variations available, including modified versions of the paleo diet, which allow  gluten-free grains  and grass-fed butter.

Noom is a mobile app diet program that is designed to help you achieve long-lasting, sustainable weight loss by promoting behavioral changes.
When you sign up, it asks a series of questions to collect details about your current diet and lifestyle. This may make it a good option for athletes looking for a more personalized approach that takes their training into account.
Membership also includes access to your virtual coaching team, which provides extra social support and motivation.
Instead of omitting certain foods altogether, Noom encourages followers to eat nutrient-dense ingredients like fruits, veggies, whole grains, and lean proteins.
Because the program is completely virtual and requires only a smartphone, it could also be a great choice for athletes with a busy schedule.

The  Nordic diet  is an eating pattern based on the traditional diets of Nordic countries like Finland, Iceland, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.
It emphasizes local, sustainably sourced foods like fruits, veggies, whole grains, seafood, low fat dairy, and legumes and restricts foods that are processed, refined, or high in  added sugar .
Because the diet permits many foods that are rich in carbohydrates, it can provide plenty of long-lasting energy for endurance athletes ( 16 ).
In fact, experts often recommend high carbohydrate foods that are easy to digest, such as fruit or yogurt, for endurance athletes to help fuel the muscles during exercise ( 17 ).
Not only does the Nordic diet encourage these foods, but it also promotes foods rich in protein and healthy fats to help round out your diet.
To learn more about how to follow the Nordic diet, consider reading “The Nordic Diet: Using Local and Organic Food to Promote a Healthy Lifestyle.”

How to choose the best diet for athletics
With so many different diet plans and programs out there, finding an option that works for you can be challenging.
When you’re choosing a plan, consider whether you prefer a flexible program or a more structured program with specific guidelines on which foods are permitted.
It’s also important to find a plan that works with your food preferences and any other dietary restrictions that you may have.
Additionally, consider whether your diet is a good fit for your athletic goals.
For example, endurance athletes may benefit from consuming more carbohydrates, whereas eating more protein may help build muscle mass when coupled with resistance training ( 18 ).
Finally, be sure to avoid any overly restrictive programs. In addition to making it more challenging to meet your nutritional needs, they can also be more difficult to follow and unsustainable in the long run.

The bottom line
There are many diet plans and programs available for every type of athlete.
When selecting a plan that works for you, be sure to consider your goals, preferences, and dietary restrictions. Try to steer clear of diets that are overly restrictive or unsustainable.
