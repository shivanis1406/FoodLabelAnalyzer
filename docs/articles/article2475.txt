Title: 10 Natural Ways to Lower Your Cholesterol Levels

Limiting saturated fats in your diet, along with getting regular exercise and engaging in other healthy practices, may help lower the amount of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in your blood.
Lipoproteins carry cholesterol, fat, and fat-soluble vitamins in your blood.
There are two types:
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL):  High levels of  LDL , or “bad” cholesterol, may result in cholesterol deposits in blood vessel walls. This could lead to clogged arteries and an  increased risk  of heart attacks.
High-density lipoprotein (HDL):   HDL , or “good” cholesterol, helps carry cholesterol away from blood vessel walls. Due to this, it helps prevent the conditions mentioned above.
Your liver produces as much cholesterol as your body needs. Yet several factors may influence these levels, including:
your family history
whether you  smoke
a sedentary lifestyle
heavy alcohol consumption
This article discusses 10 ways to help improve your cholesterol levels.

Focus on monounsaturated fats
Some people recommend an overall  low fat diet  for weight loss, but research is mixed on its effectiveness in managing blood cholesterol, according to  experts .
In contrast, there’s  strong evidence  that a diet high in monounsaturated fats, such as the  Mediterranean diet , helps reduce levels of harmful LDL and increase levels of healthy HDL.
Here are a few great sources of  monounsaturated fats :
olive oil
nuts, such as  almonds ,  cashews , and  pecans
canola oil
avocados
nut butters
olives

Prioritize polyunsaturated fats, especially omega-3s
Research from 2018  shows that polyunsaturated fats reduce LDL cholesterol and decrease the risk of  heart disease .
Polyunsaturated fats may also reduce the risk of  metabolic syndrome  and  type 2 diabetes .
Omega-3 fatty acids  are an especially heart-healthy type of  polyunsaturated fat . They’re found in  fatty seafood  and fish oil supplements, such as:
salmon
mackerel
herring
deep sea tuna like bluefin or albacore
shellfish (to a lesser degree), including shrimp

Limit trans fats
Trans fats  are unsaturated fats that have been modified by a process called hydrogenation. This makes the  unsaturated fats  in vegetable oils more stable.
The body  handles trans fats differently  than other fats, and not in a good way. Trans fats increase LDL and total cholesterol while decreasing beneficial HDL.
Foods that commonly contain trans fats include:
margarine and shortening
pastries and other baked goods
some microwaveable popcorn
fried fast foods
some pizzas
nondairy coffee creamer

Eat soluble fiber
Soluble fiber  is a type of fiber that is abundant in plants and whole grains. Prioritizing whole grains can  help lower  LDL cholesterol levels and may have a protective effect against cardiovascular diseases.
Some of the  best sources of soluble fiber  include:
oat cereals
beans and lentils
Brussels sprouts
fruits
peas
flaxseeds

Exercise
Exercise  is a win-win for heart health. Not only does it improve physical fitness and help prevent  obesity , but it also reduces harmful LDL and increases beneficial HDL.
The  American Heart Association (AHA)  advises that 150 minutes of moderate  aerobic exercise  per week is enough to lower cholesterol levels.
Regular  strength training  alongside aerobic exercise can provide even more benefits.

Maintain a healthy-for-you weight
Having excess weight or obesity can  increase your risk  of developing high cholesterol levels. Losing weight, if you have excess weight, can help lower your cholesterol levels.
Overall, weight loss has a double benefit on cholesterol by decreasing harmful LDL and increasing beneficial HDL. Consider working with a doctor to determine a nutrient-dense diet and sustainable  weight management plan  that works for you.

Avoid smoking
Smoking  tobacco increases the risk of heart disease in several ways, including:
increasing LDL
decreasing HDL
increasing cholesterol buildup in arteries
affecting cholesterol transportation and absorption
Giving up smoking, if possible, can help reverse these harmful effects. A doctor can help you create a  plan to quit smoking  that’s best for you.

Consume alcohol in moderation
Alcohol’s role in providing heart-protective benefits is a controversial topic. According to a  2020 review of studies , some research indicates that when consumed in moderation, alcoholic drinks can increase good HDL cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease.
Yet the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  and  AHA  disagree. The AHA does not recommend drinking wine or any other alcoholic beverage specifically to lower your cholesterol or improve heart health. Both organizations say there’s no credible research linking alcohol and improved heart health.
If you drink, the CDC suggests you consume only two drinks per day for males or one drink per day for females on days that you drink.

Consider plant sterols and stanols
Multiple types of supplements show promise for managing cholesterol. Plant  stanols and sterols  are plant versions of cholesterol. Because they resemble cholesterol, they’re absorbed by your body like cholesterol.
According to a 2018 research review, clinical studies show that taking 1.5–3 grams of plant sterols or stanols daily can reduce LDL concentration by  7.5–12% .
Small amounts of plant stanols and sterols are naturally found in vegetable oils and are added to certain oils and butter substitutes.

Try supplements
Certain types of supplements may improve cholesterol and promote heart health:
Fish oil  is rich in the omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). However, some fish oil supplements  may increase  LDL despite reducing triglyceride levels.
Psyllium  is a form of soluble fiber available as a supplement and may help lower cholesterol levels.
Coenzyme Q10  is a food chemical that helps cells produce energy. It’s similar to a vitamin, except that the body can produce its own Q10, preventing deficiency. Research into the efficacy of coenzyme Q10 in lowering cholesterol is ongoing.
Always work with a medical professional before starting or changing supplement regimens.

Frequently asked questions
Several lifestyle changes may help you lower your cholesterol within 30 days, including:
limiting alcohol intake, if you drink
quitting smoking, if you smoke
exercising regularly
eating a balanced diet
You may also consider taking certain types of supplements. But speak with a healthcare professional before starting or changing your supplement regimen.
Although food companies often advertise products as being low in cholesterol,  research from 2018  shows that  dietary cholesterol  has only a small influence on the amount of cholesterol in your body.
That said, some foods high in soluble fibers, omega-3 fatty acids, or monounsaturated fats may help lower cholesterol, including:
fatty fish, like salmon, mackerel, and herring
oatmeal and oat cereals
some oils, like olive oil and canola oil
vegetables, like Brussels sprouts
nuts, such as almonds and walnuts
Typically, there are no symptoms of high cholesterol. However, signs or symptoms of high cholesterol may include:
high blood pressure
areas of swelling around knuckles, knees, or the back of the ankle (tendon  xanthomata )
small yellow bumps near the corner of your eyes ( xanthelasmas )
corneal arcus, a white ring around the iris of the eye
stroke or heart attack
Eggs contain cholesterol, but managing your cholesterol isn’t only about cholesterol in the food you eat. Eating foods with cholesterol may not raise your blood cholesterol levels.  Eggs may be part  of a healthy, balanced diet. However, if you are at risk for cardiovascular disease, you may want to limit the number of eggs you eat each week.

Takeaway
Cholesterol has important functions in the body but can cause clogged arteries and heart disease when it’s not well managed.
If your cholesterol is out of balance, lifestyle interventions are the first line of treatment.
Unsaturated fats, soluble fiber, and plant sterols or stanols can increase “good” HDL and decrease “bad” LDL. Exercise and weight loss can also help.
