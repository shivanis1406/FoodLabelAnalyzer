Title: 5 Interesting Types of Lettuce

Lettuce ( Lactuca sativa ) is a popular leafy vegetable in the daisy family.
It ranges in color from yellow to dark green but may also have reddish hues. While it’s grown worldwide, China produces the greatest volume — upwards of 66% of the global supply ( 1 ,  2 ).
Lettuce is not only a major ingredient in salads but also often added to various dishes, such as wraps, soups, and sandwiches.
Although romaine and iceberg are the most common types, many varieties exist — each with their own unique flavors and nutritional properties.
Here are 5 interesting types of lettuce.

1. Crisphead lettuce
Crisphead, also known as iceberg or head lettuce, is one of the most widely used lettuces.
While it looks similar to cabbage, it’s an entirely different species.
Contrary to popular belief, crisphead lettuce is quite nutritious. A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving provides ( 3 ):
Calories:  14
Protein:  1 gram
Fiber:  1 gram
Folate:  7% of the Daily Value (DV)
Iron:  2% of the DV
Manganese:  5.4% of the DV
Potassium:  3% of the DV
Vitamin A:  3% of the DV
Vitamin C:  3% of the DV
Vitamin K:  20% of the DV
The folate and  vitamin K  contents of crisphead lettuce are particularly noteworthy.
Folate is a B vitamin that can help prevent neural tube defects, which are one of the most common birth defects. It may also lower your risk of heart disease and certain cancers, including breast and pancreatic cancer ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
Meanwhile, vitamin K is important for blood clotting, bone formation, and heart health ( 8 ).
Crisphead lettuce is also a moderate source of phenolic compounds, which are antioxidants that help fight oxidative stress and  inflammation  in your body ( 9 ).
Crisphead lettuce has a crunchy texture and mild flavor that lends itself to salads and sandwiches. It pairs well with other vegetables and most salad dressings.
You can also use its sturdy leaves as a replacement for tortillas in wraps.
To keep crisphead lettuce fresh, refrigerate it in a sealable bag with a damp paper towel.
Crisphead lettuce is widely known as iceberg lettuce. It’s light, crunchy, and full of nutrients like folate and vitamin K.

2. Romaine lettuce
Romaine, also called cos, is another popular lettuce that’s common in Caesar salads.
It bears green, crunchy leaves with large veins. Premature leaves, which are sometimes red, are frequently added to spring mix — a combination of baby leaves from several leafy vegetables.
Romaine is higher in nutrients than crisphead. A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving provides ( 10 ):
Calories:  17
Protein:  1 gram
Fiber:  2 grams
Folate:  34% of the DV
Iron:  5% of the DV
Manganese:  7% of the DV
Potassium:  5% of the DV
Vitamin A:  48% of the DV
Vitamin C:  4% of the DV
Vitamin K:  85% of the DV
It’s not only an excellent source of folate and vitamin K but also  vitamin A . This nutrient acts as a potent antioxidant and is vital for skin, eye, and immune health ( 11 ,  12 ,  13 ).
Moreover, romaine is a good source of phenolic compounds, particularly caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid. These antioxidants are associated with a lower risk of heart disease, inflammation, and certain cancers ( 9 ,  14 ).
What’s more, red romaine boasts high levels of anthocyanins, which give certain vegetables and fruits a  reddish-purple color . These pigments are associated with a lower risk of heart disease and cognitive decline ( 9 ,  15 ,  16 ).
Romaine lettuce is most frequently used in Caesar salads and other salads.
It has a slightly sweeter, bolder flavor than crisphead, which adds a mild burst to salads and sandwiches.
Although romaine works well for soups and stir-fries, you should add it near the end of cooking to prevent it from getting too soggy.
Romaine’s long, crisp leaves are popular for Caesar salads. It’s high in folate, potassium, antioxidants, and vitamins A and K.

3. Butterhead lettuce
Butterhead lettuce gets its name from its characteristically soft, buttery leaves. It’s also known as cabbage lettuce due to its round shape. The most popular types of butterhead are Bibb and Boston lettuce.
Its leaves have a crumpled look that resembles flower petals. Butterhead lettuce is usually deep green, although red varieties exist.
It’s rich in nutrients, with 3.5 ounces (100 grams) offering ( 17 ):
Calories:  13
Protein:  1.5 grams
Fiber:  1 gram
Folate:  18% of the DV
Iron:  8% of the DV
Manganese:  8% of the DV
Potassium:  5% of the DV
Vitamin A:  18% of the DV
Vitamin C:  4% of the DV
Vitamin K:  85% of the DV
This lettuce is a good source of carotenoid antioxidants, such as beta carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin. These protect your eyes from macular degeneration, a condition that can result in partial vision loss ( 18 ).
Furthermore, butterhead contains  higher amounts of iron  than other lettuces. This nutrient is essential for creating red blood cells ( 9 ,  19 ).
Keep in mind that plants provide only non-heme iron, which is poorly absorbed. As vitamin C helps increase your absorption, consider eating butterhead lettuce with a  food high in this vitamin , such as red peppers ( 19 ).
Butterhead lettuce adds a mild, sweet flavor to dishes.
It pairs well with most dressings and can enhance the flavor and texture of your salad.
Furthermore, it works well in egg-salad or tuna sandwiches and serves as a great tortilla replacement for wraps.
Store butterhead lettuce in a sealable bag in the fridge for 2–3 days, keeping the leaves dry to prevent wilting.
Butterhead lettuce has soft leaves and looks similar to cabbage. It’s particularly high in iron and vitamins A and K.

4. Leaf lettuce
Leaf lettuce, also known as loose-leaf lettuce, varies in shape, color, and texture — though it’s usually crisp, ruffled, and dark green or red, with a flavor ranging from mild to sweet.
Unlike other lettuces, it doesn’t grow around a head. Instead, its leaves come together at a stem.
A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of either green or red leaf lettuce gives the following nutrients ( 20 ,  21 ):
Green leaf lettuce tends to have more vitamin C, while the red variety offers more vitamin K.
Both types are high in vitamin A, beta carotene, lutein, and  zeaxanthin , all of which support eye and skin health ( 9 ,  11 ,  12 ,  18 ).
However,  red leaf lettuce  contains much higher levels of phenolic compounds. In particular, its anthocyanins and quercetin act as potent antioxidants that protect your body from free radical damage ( 9 ,  22 ,  23 ).
Leaf lettuce’s crisp, mild flavor lends itself to salads and sandwiches.
Furthermore, it can be used in wraps and tacos.
To store leaf lettuce, pat it dry and keep it in a plastic bag or storage container. It can usually last 7–8 days in the fridge.
Leaf lettuce has crisp, ruffled leaves. Both green and red types are high in folate, manganese, and vitamins A and K. Yet, red leaf lettuce is higher in antioxidants.

5. Stem lettuce
Stem lettuce is popular in Chinese cuisine and is commonly called Chinese lettuce, stalk lettuce, or celtuce ( 2 ).
As its name indicates, stem lettuce has a long stalk with narrow leaves. Unlike other lettuces, its stem is normally eaten but its leaves discarded. That’s because the leaves are  very bitter  due to their high latex content.
A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving offers ( 24 ):
Calories:  18
Protein:  1 gram
Fiber:  2 grams
Folate:  12% of the DV
Iron:  3% of the DV
Manganese:  30% of the DV
Potassium:  7% of the DV
Vitamin A:  19% of the DV
Vitamin C:  22% of the DV
Stem lettuce is an excellent source of  manganese , which plays a key role in fat and carb metabolism. Moreover, it’s a part of an enzyme called superoxide dismutase, which helps decrease oxidative stress in your body ( 25 ,  26 ).
Furthermore, it’s high in vitamin C, which is important for  collagen synthesis  and immune health ( 12 ,  27 ,  28 ).
Stem lettuce isn’t widespread, but you might be able to find it at international grocery stores.
Since only its stalk is eaten, it’s used differently than most lettuces. It’s said to be crunchy with a slightly nutty taste.
When preparing it, peel the stalk to get rid of the tough outer layer. The inner layers are soft and have a consistency similar to that of cucumbers. You can add it raw to salads, cook it in stir-fries and soups, or spiralize it into crunchy  veggie noodles .
Store stem lettuce in the refrigerator in an airtight bag or container for 2–3 days.
Stem lettuce is popular in Chinese cuisine. Most people eat the stem and discard its bitter leaves.

The bottom line
Lettuce  is a nutritious vegetable that comes in many varieties.
It’s full of important nutrients, such as fiber, potassium, manganese, and vitamins A and C.
While widely used in  salads , sandwiches, and wraps, certain kinds can also be cooked.
