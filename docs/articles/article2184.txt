Title: Jackfruit Seeds: Nutrition, Benefits, Concerns, and Uses

Jackfruit is a fruit found in many parts of Asia.
It has been gaining popularity due to its delicious, sweet taste and various health benefits.
However, the flesh isn’t the only part of the fruit you can eat — a single jackfruit may contain 100–500 edible and nutritious seeds ( 1 ).
Despite their beneficial nutrients, the seeds are typically discarded.
This article details everything you need to know about jackfruit seeds, including their health benefits, potential concerns, and how to add them to your diet.

Jackfruit seeds are nutritious
Compared with other tropical fruit seeds,  jackfruit  seeds pack many important nutrients ( 2 ).
They contain high levels of starch, protein, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
A 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of jackfruit seeds contains ( 3 ):
Calories:  53
Carbs:  11 grams
Protein:  2 grams
Fat:  0 grams
Fiber:  0.5 grams
Riboflavin:  8% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI)
Thiamine:  7% of RDI
Magnesium:  5% of RDI
Phosphorus:  4% of RDI
These seeds also contain high concentrations of two  B vitamins  — thiamine and riboflavin. Both help provide your body with energy, as well as perform other important functions ( 4 ,  5 ).
Furthermore, jackfruit seeds offer fiber and resistant starch, both of which pass through your body undigested and act as food for your beneficial gut bacteria ( 6 ).
Fiber and resistant starch have been linked to many powerful health benefits, including hunger control, reduced blood sugar levels, and improved digestion and insulin sensitivity ( 7 ,  8 ,  9 ).
Jackfruit seeds are a good source of important nutrients, including resistant starch, protein, thiamine, riboflavin, and antioxidants.

They have several health benefits
Jackfruit seeds have been used in Traditional Chinese medicine as an aphrodisiac and treatment for  digestive issues , among other applications.
Modern research has found that they may have other helpful properties.
In traditional medicine, jackfruit seeds have sometimes been used to relieve diarrhea.
In fact, studies have shown that jackfruit seeds may have antibacterial effects ( 2 ).
One study found that the surface of jackfruit seeds is covered with small particles that act as antibacterial agents.
It tested these particles against common bacteria, such as  E. coli , and concluded that jackfruit seeds have the potential to be developed into therapeutic agents for preventing food-borne illness ( 10 ).
However, more studies are needed to investigate the effectiveness of jackfruit seeds for these uses.
Some studies suggest that jackfruit seeds may have several anticancer properties. This is believed to be due to their impressive levels of plant compounds and antioxidants.
They are rich in antioxidants, specifically flavonoids, saponins, and phenolics ( 11 ).
Studies have shown that these plant compounds may help  fight inflammation , enhance your immune system, and even repair DNA damage ( 12 ,  13 ).
A recent test-tube study found that jackfruit seed extract reduced the formation of cancerous blood vessels by 61% ( 14 ).
However, research is limited to test-tube and animal studies. More research is needed to investigate whether jackfruit seeds have anticancer effects in people.
Similarly to other seeds, jackfruit seeds contain both soluble and insoluble fiber.
Fiber  passes through your digestive tract undigested and helps normalize bowel movements by adding bulk to your stools, making them softer and increasing frequency.
What’s more, fiber is considered a prebiotic, which means it helps feed the beneficial bacteria in your gut ( 2 ,  3 ,  15 ).
These beneficial gut bacteria help support healthy digestion and immune function ( 16 ,  17 ).
Numerous studies have found that increasing fiber intake can help  relieve constipation  ( 18 ).
Furthermore, fiber may help protect against inflammatory bowel disease and relieve symptoms of hemorrhoids ( 19 ,  20 ,  21 ).
Research also suggests that jackfruit seeds may  improve your cholesterol  levels. This effect is most likely attributed to their high fiber and antioxidant contents ( 22 ).
Elevated levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol are associated with high blood pressure, diabetes, and an increased risk of heart disease ( 23 ,  24 ).
Contrarily, higher levels of HDL (good) cholesterol have been found to have heart-protective effects ( 25 ).
A study in rats found those that ate more jackfruit seeds had reduced levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and increased HDL (good) cholesterol, compared with rats that ate fewer jackfruit seeds ( 26 ).
Research in this area is limited to animal studies, so further studies in humans are needed.
Jackfruit seeds are associated with some health benefits. However, research supporting these claims is weak and limited to mostly test-tube and animal studies. More research in humans is needed.

Possible health concerns
Although jackfruit seeds are associated with various health benefits, there are some potential concerns.
Individuals who are taking medications that increase the risk of bleeding should be cautious of consuming jackfruit seeds.
In one study, jackfruit seed extract showed the ability to slow blood clotting and even prevent clots from forming in humans ( 27 ).
Therefore, jackfruit seeds may further increase the risk of bleeding when taken with these drugs. If you’re taking medications that may increase the risk of bleeding, you should avoid consuming jackfruit seeds ( 3 ).
The following medications are known to increase the risk of bleeding:
aspirin
blood thinners (anticoagulants)
antiplatelet drugs
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen or naproxen)
Raw jackfruit seeds contain powerful antinutrients called tannins and trypsin inhibitors. These can interfere with nutrient absorption and digestion ( 1 ,  3 ).
Tannins are a type of  polyphenol  that’s commonly found in many plant foods. They can bind to minerals, such as zinc and iron, and form an insoluble mass, reducing your ability to absorb these minerals ( 28 ,  29 ,  30 ).
Trypsin inhibitors are a type of protein found in various foods, including soybeans, papaya seeds, and jackfruit seeds. Similarly to tannins, they interfere with the digestion of proteins, making it difficult to digest food ( 31 ,  32 ).
For these reasons, jackfruit seeds should never be consumed raw.
The good news is that heat inactivates these  antinutrients . Therefore, cooking jackfruit seeds by roasting or boiling them will reduce their antinutritional effects ( 1 ).
Studies have found that the presence of tannins and trypsin inhibitors in jackfruit seeds may inhibit the absorption of protein, zinc, and iron. Jackfruit seeds may also increase bleeding when taken with certain drugs.

Easy to add to your diet
Jackfruit seeds can be enjoyed similarly to other seeds.
Here are some easy ways to add them to your diet:
Top salads with them.
Make homemade jackfruit-seed hummus.
Grind them into flour for use in baking or cooking.
Add them into smoothies.
Make homemade jackfruit-seed butter.
Eat them alone as a snack.
Jackfruit seeds should not be eaten raw due to their antinutrient content. Boiling or roasting are two of the most popular preparation methods.
You can boil jackfruit seeds in a large pot of water for 20–30 minutes. Once the seeds are tender, drain the pot and let them cool and dry.
You can also roast jackfruit seeds by preheating the oven to 400°F (205°C) and laying them flat on a pan. Bake the seeds for 20 minutes, or until they are brown and toasted.
You can use jackfruit seeds to add extra flavor and a crunchy texture to dishes. Due to their large size, they can be consumed in many different ways.
You can eat jackfruit seeds in numerous ways. However, always cook them before you eat them.

The bottom line
Jackfruit seeds are not only edible but also highly nutritious. They have been associated with a number of health benefits, including improved digestion and cholesterol levels.
That said, they may hinder nutrient absorption if eaten raw, as well as increase the risk of bleeding in people taking certain medications.
The next time you eat jackfruit, take full advantage of everything it has to offer by enjoying the seeds along with the delicious, sweet fruit.
