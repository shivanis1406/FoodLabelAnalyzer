However, despite its growing popularity, many people may wonder if this spicy snack is healthy and whether or not it can fit into a balanced diet.
This article looks at the nutritional content of wasabi peas, along with the potential benefits and downsides.

Wasabi peas contain a small amount of protein and  fiber  in each serving. They also provide important nutrients, including manganese, thiamin, copper, and vitamin K.
A 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of wasabi peas contains the following nutrients ( 1 ):
Calories:  121
Carbs:  17.5 grams
Sugar:  4 grams
Protein:  4 grams
Fat:  4 grams

Wasabi peas are particularly rich in manganese, an essential mineral that acts as an antioxidant to help prevent oxidative damage to the cells ( 2 ).
They also provide thiamin, a B vitamin that plays a key role in energy metabolism, growth, and development ( 3 ).
Additionally, they contain about 14% of the recommended DV for copper, which is important for producing connective tissue and certain neurotransmitters in the brain ( 4 ).
However, note that wasabi peas are relatively high in carbs, with nearly 18 grams in a single ounce ( 1 ).
Some commercial varieties may also be high in sodium or  added sugar , though this can vary depending on the specific brand and the amount of sugar and salt used to make the coating.

Health benefits of wasabi peas
Thanks to their nutrient profile, wasabi peas may be associated with several potential health benefits.
Wasabi peas contain a good chunk of fiber in each serving, packing 1 gram into a single ounce (28 grams) ( 1 ).
Fiber moves slowly through the digestive tract and adds bulk to the stool to promote regularity ( 5 ,  6 ).
Some research suggests that fiber can increase stool frequency and improve stool consistency in people with  constipation  ( 7 ).
Increasing your fiber intake may even protect against several other digestive issues, including hemorrhoids,  diverticulitis , and colorectal cancer ( 5 ).
Wasabi peas can bump up your fiber intake to help you meet your needs. According to the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans, daily fiber requirements range from 22-34 grams per day, depending on your age and assigned sex at birth ( 8 ).
Green peas are a great source of  antioxidants , which can help neutralize harmful compounds known as free radicals ( 9 ,  10 ).
In particular, green peas contain specific antioxidant compounds such as ( 11 ,  12 ):
ellagic acid
beta-sitosterol
p-coumaric acid
naringenin
quercetin
luteolin
apigenin
In addition to fighting  oxidative damage  caused by free radicals, antioxidants can decrease inflammation and protect against chronic conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease ( 13 ,  14 ).
Not only that, but some test-tube studies suggest that certain compounds found in peas may possess anticancer properties and could help slow the growth of cancer cells, though more research is needed ( 12 ).
Wasabi peas are a good source of protein and fiber, two nutrients that can help support healthy blood sugar levels.
In fact, fiber can slow the absorption of sugar in the bloodstream to prevent spikes and crashes in  blood sugar levels  after eating ( 15 ).
Meanwhile, protein can improve insulin sensitivity and reduce  insulin resistance , which may also be beneficial for promoting blood sugar control ( 16 ).
Furthermore, wasabi peas contain a good amount of manganese, which may be linked to a lower risk of diabetes and prediabetes ( 17 ,  18 ).
However, keep in mind that some commercial varieties may contain a high amount of added sugar and carbohydrates per serving, negating the beneficial effects of fiber and protein on blood sugar control ( 19 ).
Be sure to check the ingredients label carefully, or try making your own wasabi peas at home to keep your intake of added sugar in check and maximize the potential benefits.
Wasabi peas are rich in disease-fighting antioxidants and contain nutrients that could support digestive health and help stabilize blood sugar levels. However, some varieties may be high in added sugar and cause spikes in blood sugar.

Potential downsides of wasabi peas
Though wasabi peas can be a great addition to a  balanced diet  for most healthy adults, there are some possible downsides to consider.
For starters, wasabi peas are often spicy, which may trigger acid reflux or heartburn for some people ( 20 ).
Additionally, some people may be allergic to green peas and may need to avoid wasabi peas altogether ( 21 ,  22 ).
Plus, some commercial varieties use wheat flour. Therefore, those following a gluten-free diet should read the ingredients label carefully and opt for a certified gluten-free brand.
Keep in mind that peas also contain  antinutrients , which are compounds that can interfere with the absorption of certain nutrients in the body ( 23 ).
However, wasabi peas are cooked and processed before consumption, significantly reducing the number of antinutrients ( 23 ).
While all green peas are starchy, and therefore already a source of carbs, some commercial varieties of wasabi peas may be very high in carbs and added sugar depending on the type of coating used ( 24 ).
In addition to causing fluctuations in blood sugar levels, consuming high amounts of added sugar could contribute to several chronic conditions, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and liver problems ( 19 ,  25 ).
Certain brands may also be high in sodium, increasing blood pressure levels for some people ( 26 ).
Finally, note that wasabi peas are relatively high in calories, with around 121 calories in a single ounce (28 grams) ( 1 ).
For this reason, it’s important to moderate your intake, especially if you are trying to reach or maintain a moderate weight.
You may also want to check the ingredients label and opt for a brand that is lower in sodium, carbs, and added sugar, or try making your wasabi peas at home.
Some people may need to avoid wasabi peas or moderate their intake, including those who are allergic, are prone to acid reflux, have high blood pressure levels, or are trying to reach or maintain a moderate weight. Green peas also contain some antinutrients, though this amount is reduced by cooking.
