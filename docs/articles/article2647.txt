Title: 5 Latinx and Asian Ingredients This Multicultural Food Writer Uses to Eat Well

The first and only time I went to a dietitian, they gave me a pamphlet with healthy recipes, as you might expect.
Still, I wasn’t prepared for what I saw.
Dull-colored cantaloupe stuffed with cottage cheese, soggy iceberg lettuce salads, and bland rice substitutes greeted me as I peeled back the bundle of paper.
“Is this really it?” I asked.
Needless to say, I was disappointed. As a food writer and recipe developer—and person who enjoys eating—I crave flavor, color, texture, and diversity in my food.
The pamphlet had none of that.
I am half Asian and half Latinx. My cultural background has always informed what dishes I’m drawn to, whether it’s because I grew up with a specific ingredient or wanted to discover more about a recipe’s history.
Once I got a little older and became aware of the healthy food conversation, I soon realized the food I liked wasn’t a part of it.
Food deemed healthy always  came from a Euro-centric  lens and many, if not all, Asian and Latinx dishes were left out.


Fighting back against nutritional bias
According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Commission on Dietetic Registration,  80 percent  of roughly 119,000 registered dietitians in the U.S. are non-Hispanic white.
In  New York Times  article analyzing these findings, writer Priya Krishna notes that “many dieticians say the academy’s research, programs and articles ignore non-Western cuisines, or imply that they are unhealthy.”

Using Asian and Latinx ingredients to eat well in my personal life feels like a small way to fight against a lot of harmful thinking. I cook to nourish my body, but in return, it also allows me to relive my happy memories.
The red and green skin of  mangoes  transport me to my childhood where I’d run around mango trees with my brother.
The tangy taste of  kimchi  takes me back to nights out with friends around a hot Korean BBQ grill.
And whenever I peel green  plantains , the smell makes me feel like I’m home.

Here are some of the Asian and Latinx ingredients I cook with to eat well for both my body and mind. Each one brings a wealth of flavor, color, and nutrition to whatever dish they’re in.
No sad, soggy salads here!

Miso
I’m currently based in Tokyo, so there’s a huge variety of  miso  that’s easily accessible to me.
In the U.S., you can usually choose from white, yellow, or red miso at Asian grocery stores. The color range depends on how long the soybeans are fermented: white being the least fermented with subtle sweet notes to red being the most aged with a deep, robust flavor.
I love miso because of how extremely versatile it is. I’ve used it in everything from marinating chicken to mixing cookie dough.
It’s rich in umami, but also offers a range of health benefits.
Research from 2021  found that It contains a wide variety of nutritious fermented enzymes, amino acids, and beneficial microbes.
You can easily purchase miso at most grocery stores, but for the biggest selection, go to a Japanese market.
Use it for soups, salad dressings, marinades, baking,  and more .

Mango
Hands down, mangoes are my favorite fruit. I eat them mixed into salsa, blended with ice or sprinkled with Tajín, a Mexican seasoning made of chili, lime, and salt. There’s no one way to enjoy them.
Most grocery stores in the U.S. only carry Tommy Atkins mangoes (the big red and green ones), but there are over one thousand varieties with differing textures and sweetnesses.
Hawai’i’s Excel mangoes have very thin skin and an equally thin seed, which means a much bigger juicy fruit ratio. It’s even sometimes referred to as  Hawai’i’s gold .
Pakistan’s Anwar Ratol and Chaunsa mangoes have birthed an  underground WhatsApp market  because those varieties are so sought after.
Rich in  vitamin C  and  vitamin A , this beloved fruit offers several health benefits.
According to  2021 research , eating mangoes was associated with higher nutrient intake, diet quality, and weight-related health outcomes.
Mangoes are readily available at almost all supermarkets. Warmer climates tend to grow more mango varieties, so be sure to check out local farmers markets.
Use them for salsa,  salads (sweet or savory ), sliced over sticky rice, blended into mango lassi, or just raw with a little bit of Tajín. They’re also a key ingredient in my  adobo-seared fish with mango salsa recipe .

Canned beans
While I love the texture of dried beans, I often find myself forgetting to soak them ahead of time. That’s when  canned beans  come through.
Within moments, I can eat refried beans, black beans spiced with cumin, or  crisp chickpeas .
Beans are a huge part of Latinx culture and are something I always gravitate toward for a quick but satisfying meal.
They’re also affordable and have a long-shelf life, which is why I always keep a hefty supply stashed away in my pantry for when that bean craving hits.
Just one can of pinto beans has  19.4 grams of protein , nearly 30 percent of the  Recommended Dietary Allowance  of 64.8 grams or 0.36 grams of protein per pound (0.8 grams per kg) of body weight for a 180 pound person.
According to a  2021 systematic review and meta-analysis , common beans reduced LDL cholesterol by 19 percent, risk of cardiovascular disease by 11 percent, and coronary heart disease by 22 percent.
Some common types of beans mentioned in the study include:
navy beans
pinto beans
haricot beans
white beans
red kidney beans
The review also noted that beans are an ecologically sustainable protein source compared to animal-based ones.
Luckily, you’re likely to find canned beans at any grocery store. Use them dips, pair with rice, spoon over tortillas, make a grain bowl,  and more .

Kimchi
Kimchi  is arguably the most important cultural dish of Korea.
For over 3,000 years, huge heads of cabbage have been coated in mixtures of sugar, salt, onion, garlic, ginger, and gochugaru (Korean red pepper) and left to fermate until tangy.
Some of my favorite ways to eat it are in fried rice,  jjigae (Korean stew) , or simply straight from the jar.
During the fermentation process, powerful  probiotics  form that make kimchi a Korean superfood.
According to a  2018 review , kimchi has been found to have several health benefits, including:
stimulating immune function
reducing free radicals
reducing the risk of certain cancers
reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease
reducing the risk of metabolic syndrome
increasing intestinal microflora
increasing iron levels
You can commonly find kimchi at most health food stores. For the largest selection, visit a Korean grocery store, like  H-Mart .
There are countless types of kimchi, and each one is special. The most common variety is made with cabbage, which I like to mix into fried rice, eat in soups, or simply use as a side.
Not all kimchi found in a grocery store contains probiotics. Look for kimchi in the refrigerated foods section and read the packaging to be sure the product contains live, active cultures. Most canned kimchi products don’t contain live probiotic strains.

Plantains
Last but not least is the mighty  plantain . Throughout Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean, plantains have been a staple food for centuries.
Unlike sweet bananas, plantains are starchy and contain less sugar. I grew up enjoying them in both their green, unripened state and so ripe they turned black.
At both stages and in between, there are countless ways to prepare them.
Tostones and maduros were constant side dishes in my family home.
Tostones  are made when the plantains are green and unripe. It fully takes advantage of their stratchiness by double frying them and leaving every edge golden.
On the other hand,  maduros  are best made with plantains that are black and full of natural sugars. In a quick shallow fry, the sugary bits caramelize and the entire slice grows tender.
They’re a rich source of fiber and contain a variety of vitamins and minerals like magnesium and potassium, among many other benefits.
Research from 2019  noted that plantain flesh and peels are high in high several important nutrients, like:
potassium
calcium
magnesium
phosphorus
nitrogen
fiber
They also play an important role in food security and preventing malnutrition in tropical and sub-tropical areas, including Africa.
Plantains are readily available at many grocery stores throughout the U.S.
If you’re unable to find them in your usual spot, visit a grocery store in a Latinx neighborhood.
There are truly an infinite amount of ways to  enjoy plantains  at every stage of ripeness.
For green plantains, try making tostones. For nearly-black/all-black plantains, slice at an angle and fry to make maduros.

Takeaway
No single culture has a monopoly on healthy eating. It’s time we honor the rich culture, traditions, and cuisines that Black and brown cultures have to offer.
Doing so can be as simple as visiting a new grocery store with different types of food than you’re used to or digging up a recipe your ancestors used to make.
Healthy food doesn’t have to be boring, bland, or exclusively white.
