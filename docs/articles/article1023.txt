Title: Research-Backed Strategies for a Flatter Stomach

It’s difficult to target fat loss to a specific area, but you may be able to lose weight and gain muscle around your midsection with a nutrient-rich diet, targeted exercise, and some healthy lifestyle strategies.
Reducing excess abdominal fat isn’t as simple as some would have you believe. The flatness of your stomach area depends on many factors, including the time of day and what you’ve eaten recently.
Experts also debate whether targeted fat loss in a specific body area is possible. Fat cells are stored  throughout the body . They can be broken down and used as energy during exercise from any part of the body, not just the area that you’re engaging.
Here’s a closer look at strategies for general weight loss and reduced bloating.

Diet strategies for losing belly fat
You don’t need to incorporate these strategies all at once. Instead, look for shifts you can add slowly over time.
If you’re looking to lose weight, you may want to monitor your  calorie  intake.
However, restricting your calorie intake too much can be counterproductive and harmful to your health.
Eating too few calories can cause a  decrease in your metabolic rate , or the number of  calories you burn  on a daily basis. It can also cause a  significant reduction  in lean body mass, which can lower the number of calories that you burn at rest.
Studies  have shown a direct link between high intake of added sugar and increased waist size, especially in people who drink sugar-sweetened beverages.
Various foods contain added sugar, so it’s important to check the ingredient label carefully when shopping. The revised Nutrition Facts labels on packaged foods and drinks make it easier to see how much added sugar is in the product you’re considering.
Try to limit added sugar intake to  less than 10%  of total daily calories. On a 2,000-calorie diet, this translates to about 200 calories or 12 teaspoons (48 grams) per day.
Limiting your total  carb intake  may help reduce belly fat and  support weight loss .
However, you don’t have to cut out all carbs to reap the benefits, especially if a low carb diet isn’t ideal for you. Replacing refined carbs, which are heavily processed and low in important nutrients like fiber, with whole grains  can be beneficial .
Soluble fibers absorb large quantities of water and slow the passing of food through the digestive tract.
This can  increase  feelings of fullness, help  decrease  carb absorption, and  protect  against the accumulation of  visceral fat  around the organs.
Fruits, oats, barley, legumes, and certain vegetables, such as broccoli and carrots, are good sources of soluble fiber.
Learn about  other fiber-rich foods  to add to your diet.
Probiotics  are a type of beneficial bacteria that  may play a key role  in weight management.
Some strains of probiotics  have been shown to be particularly effective at helping  reduce belly fat  in people who are already living with obesity. These include:
Lactobacillus fermentum
Lactobacillus amylovorus
Lactobacillus gasseri
Some research  suggests that the gut microbiome may affect weight gain, and alterations in its composition could also be linked to a greater risk of obesity.
Taking probiotics may help increase beneficial gut flora, reducing the risk of weight gain.  Fermented foods  like yogurt, kefir, tempeh, kimchi, and pickles are good sources of probiotics.
It’s important to note that probiotics do not directly cause weight loss. They can be a helpful tool when used alongside a nutritious diet and exercise, but they may not have the same effect on everyone.
Always talk with a doctor or a  registered dietitian  before deciding to add probiotics to your diet.
Protein is an  important  nutrient when it comes to weight loss.  High protein diets  can reduce your appetite and increase feelings of fullness. Additionally, your body burns more calories digesting protein than fat or carbs.
Protein can also help  retain lean body mass  during weight loss, which can help maintain your metabolism to ease weight management.
How much protein  you need depends on many factors, such as your age, sex, and activity level.
Eggs  are high in protein and low in calories, with about  72 calories and 6 grams of protein  in one large egg.
Some research suggests that eggs can help support weight loss.
For example, one  2020 study  found that people who ate a breakfast containing eggs consumed fewer calories at lunch compared with those who ate a breakfast with cereal.
Fatty fish is a  nutrient-dense food  that’s rich in protein and  omega-3 fatty acids .  Studies  suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be tied to reduced belly fat.
It’s generally  recommended  to eat fatty  fish  once or twice per week.
While whole foods are generally the best way to get your vitamins and minerals, if you don’t like eating fatty fish, you can get long-chain fatty acids from  fish oil  or fish oil supplements.
Be aware that fish oil supplements only provide omega-3s, not protein. In addition, use caution when purchasing fish oil supplements, as supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
One more note of caution: Be sure to talk with a doctor or dietitian first if you’re considering taking any kind of supplements. Some of them can interact with medications or health conditions you may have.
Diets high in monounsaturated fatty acids  may help  reduce belly fat and help with weight management.
Monounsaturated fatty acids are a type of heart-healthy fat found in a variety of foods.
The  Mediterranean diet  is an example of a diet that’s high in monounsaturated fatty acids. This diet is  linked to  many health benefits, including a reduced risk of weight gain and decreased belly fat in children and adults.
Foods high in monounsaturated fatty acids include olive oil, avocados, nuts, and seeds.
Remember to swap unsaturated fats for monounsaturated fats to avoid adding calories if your goal is weight loss.

Exercise strategies for losing belly fat
Certain tweaks to your fitness habits can also promote weight loss.
Doing cardio, also called aerobic exercise, is an excellent way to  burn calories  and improve overall health. Examples of cardio include running, brisk walking, biking, and rowing.
The  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services  recommends adults get at least:
150 to 300 minutes per week of moderate intensity aerobic physical activity,  or
75 to 150 minutes per week of vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity,  or
an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous intensity aerobic activity (ideally, aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week)
Losing muscle mass is a common side effect of dieting. This can reduce the number of calories you burn on a daily basis.
Doing resistance exercises regularly  may preserve  lean body mass and help you maintain or improve your metabolism.
Moreover, resistance training may even be effective at  reducing total body fat and visceral fat .
If you’re able, exercising while standing up  may benefit your health  more than exercising while sitting or using weight machines.
By standing, you activate more muscles to maintain balance and hold up your weight. Therefore, you spend more energy working out.
Although this might seem like a minor alteration, for individuals who are able to, standing can be an easy way to strengthen the midsection and maximize your results.
HIIT is a type of exercise that involves doing intervals of very intense activity, such as sprinting, rowing, or jumping, with short breaks in between.
This method of exercising helps your body  burn more fat  and temporarily increases your metabolic rate, even after you’ve finished your workout. This is due to  excess post-exercise oxygen consumption .

Healthful lifestyle strategies for losing belly fat
Small changes to your daily habits may also help with weight loss.
You don’t need to exercise vigorously or spend hours in the gym to reap health benefits.
Regular, brisk walks have been shown to  effectively reduce  total body fat and the fat located around the midsection in people with obesity.
A  small 2019 study  found that people with obesity who walked 12,000 steps per day and took a  brisk walk  three times a week had reduced visceral fat and hip circumferences after 8 weeks.
Drinking more  water  may help support weight management and prevent bloating.
Increased water intake may  promote weight loss  by very  temporarily increasing  your metabolic rate, or the number of calories that you burn at rest.
Drinking water before meals may also help you feel fuller, helping reduce calorie intake.
Staying hydrated can also  help relieve constipation , which can contribute to bloating.
Mindful eating  is a technique that helps you recognize and cope with your emotions and physical sensations regarding food and hunger.
It involves:
eating without distractions
focusing on your physical hunger cues
eating only until you feel full
Most studies agree  that mindful eating helps promote weight management by changing your eating behaviors and reducing stress-related behaviors, such as emotional eating or overeating.
Chronic stress  may contribute  to overeating and emotional eating, which can lead to weight gain.
Additionally, stress  triggers  the body to produce cortisol, a hormone that can increase appetite and food cravings.
It’s not realistic to completely eliminate stress, but incorporating stress-relieving activities into your daily routine, like yoga or meditation, can help.

When you’re trying to lose weight, monitoring your diet by keeping a  food diary  can be helpful. Food diaries can give you insight into your personal eating patterns, portion sizes, and nutrition intake.
You don’t have to do this all the time, but it may be good to keep track of your intake for several days in a row every few weeks. This will make you more aware of your calorie intake and allow you to adjust your eating patterns if needed.
Alcohol  contains 7 calories for each gram.
Ounce for ounce, beer contains a  similar number of calories  as a sugary soft drink, while  red wine  contains nearly  twice  that amount.
If you regularly drink alcohol, cutting back or eliminating it from your diet can be an easy way to reduce calories.
Getting enough  quality sleep  is important for weight management.
A  2021 study  found that better sleep health was associated with greater weight loss and fat loss during a 12-month weight loss intervention.
Most adults should aim for  at least 7 hours  of sleep per night to support overall health and maintain a moderate weight.
You can easily add extra activities into your day by increasing the amount of  non-exercise activity  you do. This includes standing, fidgeting, or just generally moving around.
These activities  may help  you burn additional calories per day, depending on factors like your body size and activity level.
Easy ways to add extra activity to your daily routine include walking around while talking on the phone, standing up regularly, working at a  standing desk , or taking the stairs instead of the elevator whenever possible.

The bottom line
It’s not possible to “target” fat loss in just your abdominal area, but many strategies can help support overall fat loss and weight loss effectively.
Just keep in mind that weight loss won’t necessarily make your abdomen flat. Some people might always carry some extra weight in this area due to genetics and other factors. If you want to learn to accept your body as it is,  body neutrality  may be a helpful framework.
A negative body image can mean being overly focused on comparing your size, shape, or appearance to unrealistic ideals. It can lead to unhealthy self-talk, low self-esteem, and disordered eating patterns.
