Title: 11 Probiotic Foods That Are Super Healthy

Adding probiotics to your diet may offer many health benefits. Yogurt is one of the best sources of probiotics. Other sources of probiotics include sauerkraut, miso, and tempeh.
Probiotics are live microorganisms that have health benefits when consumed. These beneficial bacteria provide all sorts of powerful  benefits  for your body and brain. They may:
improve digestive health
reduce depression
promote heart health
boost immunity
Some evidence suggests they may even give you  better-looking skin .
Consuming probiotics in  supplement  form is one popular way to get them, but you can also get them from fermented foods.
This article reviews 11 probiotic foods that are super healthy.

1. Yogurt
Yogurt  is one of the best sources of probiotics. It’s made from milk fermented by probiotics,  mainly  lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
Health benefits associated with eating yogurt  include :
improved bone, heart, and gastrointestinal health
reduced risk of diabetes
reduced risk of breast and colon cancer
improved weight management
Additionally, yogurt may be suitable for people with  lactose intolerance . This is because the bacteria turn some of the lactose into lactic acid, which is also what gives yogurt its sour taste.
However, not all yogurt contains live probiotics, and processing can sometimes kill the live bacteria. For this reason, make sure to choose yogurt with active or live cultures.
Also, be on the lookout for high amounts of  added sugar , even if the product is labeled “low fat” or “fat-free.”
Probiotic yogurt is associated with a number of health benefits and may be suitable for people with lactose intolerance. Make sure to choose yogurt that has active or live cultures.

2. Kefir
Kefir  is a fermented probiotic milk drink. It’s made by adding kefir grains to cow’s or goat’s milk.
Kefir grains are not cereal grains but rather cultures of lactic acid bacteria and yeast that look a bit like cauliflower.
The word “kefir” is thought to come from the Turkish word “ keyif ,” which means feeling good after eating.
Indeed, kefir has been linked to various  health benefits . It may improve bone health, help with digestive problems, and protect against infections. Kefir may also be a good option for people with lactose intolerance.
Kefir contains several major strains of friendly bacteria and yeast, making it a more diverse and potent probiotic source  compared to yogurt .
Kefir is a fermented milk drink. It’s a better source of probiotics than yogurt, and people with lactose intolerance can often drink kefir with no problems.

3. Sauerkraut
Sauerkraut  is finely shredded cabbage that has been fermented by lactic acid bacteria. It’s a traditional food popular in many countries, especially Eastern Europe.
Sauerkraut has a sour, salty taste. People often use it on top of sausages or as a side dish. You can store it for months in an airtight container.
In addition to its probiotic qualities, sauerkraut is  rich in fiber  as well as vitamins C and K. It’s also high in sodium and contains iron and  potassium .
Sauerkraut also contains the antioxidants  lutein and zeaxanthin , which are important for  eye health .
Make sure to choose unpasteurized sauerkraut.  Pasteurization  kills the live and active bacteria.
Sauerkraut is finely cut, fermented cabbage. It’s rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Make sure to choose unpasteurized brands that contain live bacteria.

4. Tempeh
Tempeh  is a fermented soybean product that forms a firm patty. Originally from Indonesia, tempeh has become popular worldwide as a high protein meat substitute. People describe its flavor as nutty, earthy, or similar to that of a mushroom.
The fermentation process has some surprising effects on its nutritional profile.
Soybeans are typically high in  phytic acid , a plant compound that impairs the absorption of minerals like iron and zinc.
However, fermentation  lowers the amount of phytic acid , which may increase the amount of minerals your body can absorb from tempeh.
Fermentation also produces some  vitamin B12 , a nutrient that soybeans  do not contain . You usually get vitamin B12 from animal products, so tempeh is a great substitute for vegetarians.
Tempeh is a fermented soybean product that serves as a popular, high protein substitute for meat. It contains a decent amount of vitamin B12, a nutrient found mainly in animal products.

5. Kimchi
Kimchi is a fermented, spicy Korean side dish. Cabbage is usually the main ingredient, but other vegetables can also be used.
Kimchi is flavored with a mix of seasonings, such as red chili pepper flakes,  garlic ,  ginger ,  scallion , and salt.
It contains the bacteria Lactobacillus kimchii and other lactic acid bacteria that  may benefit digestive health .
Kimchi made from cabbage is high in some vitamins and minerals, including  vitamin K , riboflavin ( vitamin B2 ), and iron.

6. Miso
Miso  is a Japanese seasoning. It’s traditionally made by fermenting soybeans with salt and a fungus called koji.
Miso can also be made by mixing soybeans with other ingredients, such as barley, rice, and rye. People most often use this paste in miso soup, a popular breakfast food in Japan.
Miso is typically salty. It’s available in many varieties, including white, yellow, red, and brown.
Miso is a good source of protein and  fiber . It’s also high in various vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds, including vitamin K,  manganese , and  copper .
Some research  suggests that miso may also protect against cancer, obesity, and high blood pressure. It may also help regulate your cholesterol.

7. Kombucha
Kombucha  is a fermented black or  green tea  drink popular in many parts of the world, especially in Asia.
Some research  suggests that kombucha may reduce the risk of cancer, diabetes, and other diseases.
But  other researchers  warn that there isn’t enough high quality evidence to confirm these benefits and that clinical studies on humans are needed.
Still, because kombucha is fermented with bacteria and yeast, it likely does have health benefits related to its probiotic properties.
Kombucha is a fermented tea drink. Some people claim it has a wide range of health benefits, but more research is needed.

8. Pickles
Pickles  (also known as gherkins) are cucumbers preserved in a solution of salt and water.
They’re left to ferment for some time, using their own naturally present lactic acid bacteria, which makes them sour.
Pickled  cucumbers  are a great source of healthy probiotic bacteria, which may improve digestive health. They are also low in calories and a good source of vitamin K, an essential nutrient for blood clotting.
Keep in mind that pickles also tend to be high in  sodium .
It’s important to note that pickles made with vinegar do not contain live probiotics.

Traditional buttermilk is simply the leftover liquid from making  butter . Only this version contains probiotics, which some call “Grandma’s probiotic.”
Traditional buttermilk is mainly consumed in India, Nepal, and Pakistan.
Cultured buttermilk, commonly found in American supermarkets, generally does not have any probiotic benefits.
Buttermilk is low in fat and calories but contains several essential vitamins and minerals, such as:
vitamin B12
riboflavin

11. Some types of cheese
Although most types of cheese are fermented, it doesn’t mean that all of them contain probiotics. That’s why it’s important to look for the words “live cultures” or “active cultures” on the  food labels .
Semi-hard cheeses  such as cheddar, mozzarella, or gouda, as well as cottage cheese, may contain higher levels of probiotics than other types of cheese that are aged for longer periods of time. Cheesemakers are exploring  new methods  to protect probiotic bacteria through the aging process.
Cheese is highly nutritious and an excellent source of protein. It’s also rich in important vitamins and minerals,  including :
vitamins  A ,  B6 , B12,  D , and K
calcium
iodine
magnesium
potassium
phosphorus
selenium
zinc
Moderate consumption of  dairy products  such as cheese may even lower your risk of heart disease and osteoporosis.
