Title: Health Benefits of Ashwagandha, Based on Research

Potential benefits of ashwagandha include better athletic performance and sleep. Some research suggests this herb may help people with conditions like anxiety and infertility, but stronger studies are needed.
Ashwagandha is one of the most important herbs in Ayurveda, which is a traditional form of alternative medicine based on Indian principles of natural healing.
People  have used  ashwagandha for thousands of years to relieve stress, increase energy levels, and improve concentration.
“Ashwagandha” is Sanskrit for “smell of the horse,” which  refers to  both the herb’s scent and its potential ability to increase strength.
Its botanical name is  Withania somnifera , and it’s also known by several other names, including “Indian ginseng” and “winter cherry.”
The ashwagandha plant is a small shrub with yellow flowers that’s native to India and Southeast Asia. People use extracts or powder from the plant’s root or leaves  to treat  a variety of conditions, including anxiety and  fertility  issues.
Here are 8 potential benefits of ashwagandha, based on research.

1. May help reduce stress and anxiety
Ashwagandha is perhaps best known for its ability  to reduce stress . It’s classified as an  adaptogen , a substance that helps the body cope with stress.
Ashwagandha  may help  control mediators of stress, including heat shock proteins (Hsp70), cortisol, and stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK-1).
It also reduces the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a system in your body that regulates the stress response.
Research  suggests Ashwagandha supplements may  help relieve stress  and  anxiety .
In a  small study  with 58 participants, those who took 250 or 600 mg of ashwagandha extract for 8 weeks had significantly reduced perceived stress and levels of  the stress hormone cortisol  compared with those who took a placebo.
Those who took the ashwagandha supplements also saw improvements in sleep quality compared with the placebo group.
Another  study  in 60 people found that those who took 240 mg of ashwagandha extract per day for 60 days had significant reductions in anxiety compared with those who received a placebo treatment.
Thus, early research suggests ashwagandha may be a helpful supplement for stress and anxiety.
However, a  2021 review  of studies concluded that there’s not enough evidence to form a consensus on the most appropriate dosage and form of ashwagandha for treating stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety.
Ashwagandha may be effective for reducing stress and anxiety symptoms. However, more research is needed to form a consensus on appropriate forms and dosing to address stress and stress-related disorders.

2. May benefit athletic performance
Research has shown that ashwagandha may have beneficial effects on athletic performance and may be a worthwhile supplement for athletes.
One  analysis of research  included 12 studies in people who took ashwagandha doses between 120 mg and 1,250 mg per day. The results suggest the herb may enhance physical performance, including strength and oxygen use during exercise.
Another  analysis  that looked at five studies found that taking ashwagandha significantly enhanced maximum oxygen consumption (VO 2  max) in healthy adults and athletes.
VO 2  max is the maximum amount of oxygen a person can use during intense activity. It’s a measurement of heart and lung fitness.
Having optimal VO 2  max is important for athletes and nonathletes alike. Low VO 2  max is associated with increased mortality risk, while higher VO 2  max is associated with  a lower risk  of  heart disease .
Additionally, ashwagandha may help increase muscle strength.
In a  2015 study , male participants who took 600 mg of ashwagandha per day and participated in resistance training for 8 weeks had significantly greater gains in muscle strength and size compared with a placebo group.
Ashwagandha may help improve measures of physical performance in athletes and healthy adults, including VO 2  max and strength.

3. May reduce symptoms of some mental health conditions
Some evidence suggests that ashwagandha may help reduce symptoms of other  mental health conditions , including  depression , in certain populations.
In one  study , researchers looked at the effects of ashwagandha in 66 people with  schizophrenia  who were experiencing depression and anxiety.
They found that participants who took 1,000 mg of ashwagandha extract daily for 12 weeks had greater reductions in depression and anxiety than those who took a placebo.
Limited  research from 2013  also suggests that ashwagandha may help improve cognitive impairment in people with  bipolar disorder .
A  2021 review  concluded that ashwaghanda may help manage depression, anxiety,  insomnia , and other mental health-related and neurological issues.
However, more research is needed into all these uses.
The limited research available suggests that ashwagandha may help reduce symptoms of depression and benefit people with some mental health conditions. However, more research is needed.

4. May help boost testosterone and increase fertility in men
Ashwagandha supplements have been shown in some studies to benefit  male fertility  and  increase testosterone  levels.
In  one study , 43 males aged 40–70 with overweight and mild fatigue took tablets containing ashwagandha extract or a placebo daily for 8 weeks.
The treatment was associated with an 18% greater increase in DHEA-S, a sex hormone involved in testosterone production. Participants who took the herb also had a 14.7% greater increase in testosterone than those who took the placebo.
Additionally, a  review of four studies  found that ashwagandha treatment significantly increased sperm concentration, semen volume, and  sperm motility  in males with  low sperm count .
It also increased sperm concentration and motility in males with  normal sperm count .
However, more studies are needed.
Ashwagandha may help increase testosterone levels and may have some potential benefits for male fertility. However, more research is needed.

5. May reduce blood sugar levels
Limited evidence suggests that ashwagandha may have some benefits for people with diabetes or  high blood sugar  levels.
A  review of 24 studies , including 5 clinical studies in people with  diabetes , found that treatment with ashwagandha significantly  reduced blood sugar , hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), insulin, blood lipids, and  oxidative stress  markers.
The  reason may be  that certain compounds within ashwagandha — including one called withaferin A (WA) — have powerful antidiabetic activity and may help stimulate cells to take in  glucose  from the bloodstream.
However, research is limited at this time, and more well-designed studies are needed.
Limited evidence suggests that ashwagandha may reduce blood sugar levels through its effects on insulin secretion and cells’ ability to absorb glucose from the bloodstream.

6. May reduce inflammation
Ashwagandha contains compounds, including WA, that may  help reduce inflammation  in the body.
Animal studies  have shown that WA may also help reduce levels of inflammatory proteins such as interleukin-10 (IL-10), and there’s some evidence ashwagandha may help  reduce inflammatory markers  in humans too.
In a  2021 study , researchers gave people with COVID-19 an Ayurvedic drug containing 0.5 grams of ashwagandha and  other herbs  twice per day for 7 days. This reduced participants’ levels of inflammatory markers CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α compared with a placebo.
The treatment formulation also contained:
1 gram of  giloy ghanvati  ( Tinospora cordifolia )
2 grams of swasari ras (a traditional herbo-mineral formulation)
0.5 grams of  tulsi  ghanvati ( Ocimum sanctum )
However, research on ashwagandha’s potential effects on inflammation remain limited.
Ashwagandha may help reduce inflammatory markers in the body. However, more research is needed.

7. May improve brain function, including memory
Taking ashwagandha may benefit cognitive function.
One  review  of five clinical studies found early evidence that ashwagandha could improve cognitive functioning in certain populations, including older adults with  mild cognitive impairment  and people with schizophrenia.
Cognitive functions it may benefit included:
executive functioning
attention
reaction time
performance on cognitive tasks
A  study  in 50 adults showed that taking 600 mg of ashwagandha extract per day for 8 weeks led to significant improvements in the following measures compared with taking a placebo:
immediate and general memory
attention
information-processing speed
The researchers noted that compounds found in ashwagandha, including WA, have antioxidant effects in the brain, which may benefit cognitive health.
However, more research is needed before experts can draw strong conclusions.
Ashwagandha supplements may improve memory, reaction time, and the ability to perform tasks in certain populations. However, more research is needed.

8. May help improve sleep
Many people take ashwagandha to  promote restful sleep , and some evidence suggests it may help with  sleep issues .
For example,  a study  in 50 adults ages 65–80 found that taking 600 mg of ashwagandha root per day for 12 weeks significantly  improved sleep quality  and mental alertness upon waking compared with a placebo treatment.
Additionally,  one review  of five high quality studies found that ashwagandha appeared to:
have a small but significant positive effect on overall sleep quality
reduce anxiety levels
help people feel more alert when they woke up
The results were more pronounced in people with  insomnia  and in those who took more than 600 mg daily for 8 weeks or longer.
Recent evidence suggests that ashwagandha may be an effective natural remedy to improve sleep and may especially help people with insomnia.
