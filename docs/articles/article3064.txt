Title: The 15 Best Cholesterol-Lowering Snacks

High cholesterol levels may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and stroke ( 1 ).
You can lower your cholesterol levels by choosing meals and snacks that ( 2 ):
contain healthier unsaturated fats instead of saturated or trans fats
are rich in soluble fiber, such as whole grains and beans
contain lots of vegetables and fruits
are made with fish that contain omega-3 fats
are lower in salt, cholesterol, and alcohol
If you have high cholesterol, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends limiting your intake of saturated fats from foods like meat and dairy to 6% or less of your daily calories. That’s about 11–13 grams of saturated fat per day if you eat about 2,000 calories ( 3 ).
Sometimes it may be difficult to choose nutritious snacks, and it’s easy to default to highly processed foods such as cookies, chips, and candy bars. These ultra-processed snacks are often high in salt and saturated fat, which may raise cholesterol levels ( 2 ).
There’s a better way to snack! Here are 15 nutrient-dense, high fiber snacks that may help lower your cholesterol.

Healthline’s picks of the best homemade low cholesterol snacks
If you’re looking to bolster your grocery list with some foods to help manage your cholesterol levels, these tasty homemade snack suggestions may inspire you.
Each snack features fiber and heart-healthy unsaturated fats from whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts, and whole grains. Plus, they’re all low in saturated fat.
Avocado  is a rich source of unsaturated fat, which has been shown to help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol ( 4 ).
What’s more, half an avocado contains about 5 grams of fiber ( 5 ).
Pair it with whole grain toast and a tablespoon of hummus for even more fiber.
To make avocado toast, simply toast one slice of your favorite  whole grain  bread and top it with 1/4 of an avocado, thinly sliced, and a tablespoon of hummus. To add flavor, use a squeeze of lemon juice and a sprinkle of fresh herbs.
This snack contains approximately ( 5 ,  6 ):

Total fat:  9 grams
Saturated fat:  1.5 grams
Carbohydrates:  19 grams
Fiber:  7 grams
Protein:  5 grams
Cholesterol:  0 mg
Tuna is a source of  omega-3 fatty acids , a type of unsaturated fat that has cholesterol-lowering effects ( 7 ,  8 ).
You can whip up a quick tuna salad with  canned tuna  and any of your favorite mix-ins, such as mayonnaise, onion, carrot, and celery. Then, you can use nori sheets — a type of thin, edible seaweed — or lettuce leaves to make snack-size tuna sandwich wraps.
For 3 ounces of tuna with 2 teaspoons of mayonnaise and 2 nori sheets, this dish contains roughly ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ):
Calories:  153
Total fat:  8 grams

Salmon  is another great source of omega-3 fats. Much like tuna, it can be used to make a delicious, nutrient-dense snack.
To make the salad, mix canned salmon with mayonnaise, curry powder, chopped grapes, and  cashews . Next, spoon the salmon salad into a few celery sticks to create a simple, flavorful snack.
For 3 ounces of salmon with 2 teaspoons of mayonnaise and 2 celery stalks, this dish contains roughly: ( 12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ):

Oat-based energy bites are a popular choice for on-the-go snacking because they’re easy to pack and  full of protein . And there’s a bonus: Oats contain a type of soluble fiber called beta-glucan, which is known for its cholesterol-lowering effects ( 16 ).
You can make your own using rolled oats, nut butter, ground flaxseed, chia seeds,  dark chocolate , dried fruit, and honey.
A helpful ratio is 1 cup of oats to 1/2 cup of nut butter to 2 tablespoons of honey. Stir those together, and then add 1/4 cup of optional mix-ins, such as nuts, seeds, or dried fruit.
Use a spoon to scoop 1-tablespoon portions and roll them into balls with your hands. Refrigerate or freeze them until you’re heading out the door.
Two energy bites contain approximately ( 17 ,  18 ,  19 ):
Calories:  278
Total fat:  14 grams

Carbohydrates:  30 grams
Fiber:  4 grams
Protein:  10 grams
Cholesterol:  0 mg
Guacamole is another simple, flavorful way to enjoy avocado’s potential cholesterol-lowering benefits.
You can make a basic guacamole by mixing half a ripe avocado with fresh lime juice, chopped onion, diced tomato, minced  garlic , and fresh cilantro — or you can buy premade guac.
Serve it with your favorite sliced veggies for dipping. Carrots, mini bell peppers, and  asparagus  are all great options.
A quarter-cup of guacamole with a cup of sliced vegetables offers roughly ( 5 ,  20 ):

Chickpeas, also called garbanzo beans, are versatile, tasty legumes loaded with fiber and plant protein. When roasted, they become a great crunchy, heart-healthy snack option.
Simply toss cooked  chickpeas  with a bit of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and then spread them evenly on a parchment paper-lined sheet pan. Roast them at 400°F (200°C) for about 30 minutes, or until crispy.
For added flavor, you can season them with dried spices such as curry powder,  paprika , lemon zest, or black pepper.
Half a cup of roasted chickpeas made with 1 teaspoon of olive oil provides ( 21 ):

Carbohydrates:  27 grams
Fiber:  5 grams

Edamame  are immature soybeans that make a convenient, heart-healthy snack requiring very little preparation. They’re high in protein and fiber.
You can simply steam frozen edamame until they’re cooked through and then sprinkle them with a pinch of coarse salt — just be careful not to  overdo it on the salt .
One cup (160 grams) of cooked edamame (in the pods, not shelled) offers ( 22 ):

Trail mix is a great way to incorporate healthy fats and fiber into your diet. Plus, it’s fully customizable.
Mix 2 tablespoons of your favorite nuts or seeds (such as walnuts,  pumpkin seeds , pecans, and almonds) with 2 tablespoons of dried fruit (such as raisins or dried apricots) to make a delicious, filling snack mix.
If you don’t want to make your own, look for premade trail mix that doesn’t contain too much added sugar, as  excess sugar intake  may be bad for cardiovascular health ( 23 ).
The AHA recommends limiting daily added sugar intake to 25 grams (6 teaspoons) per day for women and 36 grams (9 teaspoons) per day for men ( 24 ).
A quarter-cup of trail mix (2 tablespoons of nuts mixed with 2 tablespoons of dried fruit) provides roughly:

Total fat:  7 grams
Saturated fat:  0.5 grams
Carbohydrates:  19 grams
Fiber:  3 g
Protein:  4 grams
Cholesterol:  0 mg
Apple slices and nut butter are a classic pairing, and it’s easy to see why.
Apples  provide fiber and a variety of important nutrients, such as vitamin C and potassium. Nut and seed butters such as almond, peanut, and sunflower butter provide additional fiber, a little protein, and lots of heart-healthy fats.
One large apple with 1 tablespoon of  peanut butter  provides ( 25 ,  26 ):

Popcorn can be a healthy whole grain snack, as it contains a variety of nutrients, including fiber, B vitamins, iron, potassium, and magnesium.

What causes high cholesterol?
Cholesterol is a waxy substance that your body naturally produces. Your body may make excess cholesterol if your diet is high in saturated and trans fat.
Smoking, a lack of physical activity, and overweight or obesity can also increase cholesterol levels ( 27 ).
Some people who have a healthy diet and get frequent exercise may still have high cholesterol because it’s a genetic condition. This is called familial hypercholesterolemia. This condition cannot be treated with diet or lifestyle changes alone and usually requires cholesterol-lowering medication ( 27 ,  28 ).

Foods to limit
For cholesterol management and heart disease prevention, the foods that you eat every day — known as your overall dietary pattern — matter more than any individual food.
You might consider following a heart-healthy eating plan such as the  Mediterranean diet  or the  DASH diet . These plans emphasize vegetables, fruit, whole grains, legumes, nuts, fish, and olive oil but are low in sweets, salt, and red meat ( 29,   30 ).
If you are managing your cholesterol levels, it’s important to minimize your intake of animal-based foods that are high in saturated fat, including fatty meats (like beef, pork, and lamb), processed meats (like bacon and deli meats), and butter.
While eggs were once considered a concern, more recent studies have found that eating an egg daily has no adverse effects on cholesterol levels ( 31 ).

When to see a doctor
High cholesterol does not have any symptoms. The only way to know whether you have high cholesterol is to visit a healthcare professional for a blood test ( 32 ).
You can get a test called a certain lipid profile, which checks your levels for total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol, and triglycerides. It’s important to get this test, since uncontrolled high cholesterol is a risk factor for heart disease ( 1 ,  32 ).

Frequently asked questions about low cholesterol snacks
Skip snacks that contain main ingredients high in saturated fat, such as butter, meat, lard, or shortening.
Trans fats also raise cholesterol levels, but these are less of a concern nowadays, since the FDA banned them in 2018. However,  some foods may still contain traces of trans fat , so it’s important to avoid snacks that are made with partially hydrogenated oils ( 33 ).
The snacks on this list are rich in fiber, protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals and were specifically chosen for their health benefits.
Like any other snack, they contain calories that contribute to an overall eating pattern. Of course, it’s possible to overeat, even if you’re eating nutritious snacks. You can work with a dietitian to figure out how to fit these nourishing snacks into your overall diet.
Cholesterol-lowering snacks are rich in fiber, which helps lower cholesterol levels. They are also low in saturated fat and contain healthy unsaturated fats instead. This helps reduce heart disease risk. They are filled with nutrient-dense ingredients, such as vegetables, whole grains, and beans, which protect heart health in general ( 34 ,  35 ).

The bottom line
A number of snacks may help you  keep your cholesterol levels in check .
When looking for cholesterol-friendly options, choose those that boast  plenty of fiber  and heart-healthy unsaturated fats from whole foods like nuts, seeds, whole grains, vegetables, and fruits.
Several less processed packaged snacks make good choices as well.
