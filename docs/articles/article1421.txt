Title: Turmeric and Curcumin Side Effects

Consuming turmeric supplements in high amounts may cause symptoms, including an upset stomach. It may also not be safe to take alongside certain medications.
Turmeric is a yellow-orange spice originating in southern Asia. It is a popular ingredient in many Indian and Middle Eastern dishes.
It is often consumed for its health benefits. Supplements containing turmeric or curcumin — its main active ingredient — are becoming increasingly common.
However, some people are concerned about the possible side effects of high dose turmeric and curcumin supplements. Learn more about what the evidence says.

What is turmeric?
Turmeric, also known by the scientific name  Curcuma longa , is an ancient Indian spice, medicinal herb, and food dye in the  ginger  family.
Turmeric has many health benefits and may help with several conditions, such as arthritis, digestive disorders, respiratory infections, allergies, and depression.
The root stalks are rich in plant compounds called  curcuminoids . These curcuminoids are the main active compounds in turmeric. They are responsible for turmeric’s orange-yellow color and most of its health benefits.
While turmeric can be consumed raw or in powder form, it is also widely available in the form of dietary supplements.
Some cheap turmeric powders may also contain additives that are not listed on the labels. This is called turmeric adulteration, and it is discussed in more detail below.

Adverse effects of turmeric
Turmeric is generally  considered safe  and without any serious side effects. However, some people may experience side effects when they take them in large doses as supplements.
This includes:
Not all commercial turmeric powders are pure:  This means that  cheaper and potentially toxic  ingredients have been added and are not listed on the label.
May contain fillers:   Studies  have revealed that commercial turmeric powders may contain fillers such as  cassava  starch or barley and wheat or rye flour. This can cause adverse symptoms in people with  gluten intolerance  or celiac disease.
May contain questionable food colorants : Some turmeric powders may also contain questionable food colorants, which are added to improve color when the powder is diluted with flour.
May be high in lead:  Some turmeric powders  may be high in lead , a heavy metal that is especially toxic to the nervous system.
Dietary turmeric  does not  significantly influence how your body processes medications. However, turmeric’s supplemental effects may increase or interfere with the actions of some of the medications you are taking.
This includes:
Anticoagulation effect:  This means it  can interfere  with blood clotting. Taking curcumin with anticoagulant drugs or blood thinners such as aspirin,  clopidogrel  (Plavix), or  warfarin  (Jantoven) can increase their effects and may lead to excessive bleeding.
Lower blood sugar levels:  Turmeric can also  lower  blood sugar and may enhance the effects of antidiabetic drugs or insulin.
If you’re considering taking a new supplement, always talk with a doctor first. They can identify any possible interactions with medications you’re already taking.

Adverse effects of curcumin
Curcumin supplements are  considered safe , and no adverse side effects have been reported at low doses.
A  2021 review  also found that taking doses of around 1,000 mg of curcumin per day did not lead to any apparent adverse effects.
Yet, a small proportion of people may experience some  mild side effects  at higher doses. These may include:
Digestive issues:  People may experience mild digestive issues such diarrhea
Headache:  Doses of 500 mg or higher may cause headache and nausea in a small number of people.
Skin rash:  Some people have reported a skin rash after taking curcumin, but this seems to be very rare.
However, there is currently no evidence that lower amounts of curcumin cause serious side effects in humans when taken over short periods, though human studies on the long-term effects are lacking.
While curcumin has a very good safety profile, some  research suggests  it may affect how your body processes certain medications, including:
antibiotics
anticoagulants
antidepressants
antihistamines
cardiovascular drugs
chemotherapeutic agents
That said, research on possible drug interactions with curcumin is limited and doesn’t provide enough evidence to say with certainty whether taking curcumin supplements interacts with other medications you may be taking.
If you are taking other medications, talk with a healthcare professional before taking curcumin supplements.

How much is too much?
There are no official recommendations for the intake of turmeric, and the maximum tolerable intake level has not been identified.
However, as a general rule, you should not exceed the dosage recommendations you find on supplement labels.
On the other hand, there are some official guidelines for the intake of curcumin.
The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) set the acceptable dietary intake as  1.4 mg  per pound (3 mg/kg) of body weight per day.
For example, for a 178-pound (81-kg) person, this would translate into 249 mg per day.
As always, talk with a doctor before deciding how much of a supplement you should start taking a day.

What are the benefits of turmeric?
Turmeric is used as a spice and food dye, adding both flavor and color to food. It has also been consumed for its health benefits. Almost all of these have been attributed to curcumin, its main active ingredient.
Curcumin supplements offer the following benefits, to name a few:
Reduced inflammation:  Chronic  inflammation  is associated with many diseases. Studies show that curcumin supplements  may reduce  levels of inflammatory markers and help treat or reduce symptoms of inflammatory health conditions, like inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, psoriasis, depression, and atherosclerosis.
Improved antioxidant status :  Curcumin and other curcuminoids are powerful  antioxidants  that may improve your antioxidant status. Antioxidants  protect against  cellular damage from free radicals that are associated with health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.
Improved blood vessel function :  Studies suggest that curcumin supplements may promote the dilation (widening) of blood vessels, increasing blood flow and  reducing  blood pressure.
Reduced heart attack risk :  They may also  lower the risk  of heart attacks, possibly through their anti-inflammatory effects by improving cholesterol levels.
Support neurological health :  Curcumin supplements  may improve  symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and dementia.

How to ensure turmeric quality
Some turmeric powders contain cheap fillers not mentioned on the  labels .
These adulterated powders are difficult to identify without a chemical analysis. Your best bet is to choose turmeric that has been certified by a reputable agency.
For instance, you could look for turmeric that has been certified organic by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
If you are taking turmeric or curcumin supplements, select supplements that have a quality certification by a third party. Several companies provide quality certifications for supplement manufacturers.
These include:
NSF International
Informed Choice
US Pharmacopeial Convention (USP)
Look for their seal on the packaging of products, or go to their websites to see what supplements they’ve certified.

Certain drugs cannot be taken with turmeric, such as anticoagulants (blood thinners), antacids, and diabetes medications.
Animal studies show that turmeric may help with sleep as it  increases  the non-rapid eye movement phase of the sleep cycle, which can lead to better-quality sleep.

The bottom line
Turmeric and curcumin supplements do not seem to have any serious side effects.
However, some people may be prone to mild discomfort, such as headaches or diarrhea, at high doses.
Keep in mind that low quality turmeric may be adulterated with cheap fillers, such as wheat starch, which will cause adverse symptoms in people with gluten intolerance.
Curcumin supplements may also interact with other medications you are taking. It is important to speak with a doctor before taking curcumin supplements, especially if you are currently taking other medications, like blood thinners or insulin.
Try this today : Turmeric root is much sweeter than turmeric powder.
