Title: How to Eat Low-Carb as a Vegetarian or Vegan



Cutting back on carbs is not very complicated.
Just replace the sugars and starches in your diet with vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, nuts and fats.
Seems pretty straightforward,  unless  you don’t eat meat.
Conventional low-carb diets rely heavily on  meat , which makes them unsuitable for vegetarians.
However, this does not need to be the case.
Everyone can follow a  low-carb diet , even vegetarians and vegans.
This article shows you how to do it.

Why Low-Carb?
In the past 12 years, at least  23 studies  have shown that low-carb diets can help you lose weight (without calorie counting).
One of the main reasons is that these diets can significantly reduce appetite, making you eat fewer calories without having to  consciously  try to eat less ( 1 ,  2 ).
Low-carb diets also improve health in other ways.
They are very effective at reducing  harmful belly fat , and tend to reduce triglycerides and raise HDL (the “good”) cholesterol significantly. They also tend to lower blood pressure and blood sugar levels ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
Although low-carb diets are not necessary for everyone, they can have important  health benefits  for people people with obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and certain neurological disorders.
A low-carb vegan diet can be very healthy as well. Studies on eco-atkins (vegan, 26% of calories as carbs) have shown that such a diet is much healthier than a regular low-fat diet, as well as a low-fat vegetarian diet ( 8 ,  9 ).

Different Types of Vegetarians
There are several different  types  of vegetarians. None of them eat meat or fish.
The two most common types are lacto-ovo vegetarians and vegans.
Lacto-ovo vegetarians (or simply “vegetarians”) eat  dairy products  and eggs, but vegans do not eat any animal-derived foods.

Dairy Products and Eggs Are Low in Carbs
Eggs and dairy products, without added sugar, are low in carbs, but high in both protein and fat. For vegetarians (not vegans), they are perfect for a low-carb diet.
Eggs:  Contain only trace amounts of carbs. Choose pastured, omega-3-enriched or free-range eggs if you can.
Yogurt, Greek yogurt and kefir : Choose unsweetened, full-fat versions. Find ones with live cultures for an additional  probiotic  benefit.
Grass-fed butter:  Butter from  grass-fed  cows is healthy, and fine in moderation on a low-carb diet.
Cheese:  Highly  nutrient-dense  and tasty, and can be used in all sorts of recipes.
These foods are also rich in vitamin B12, which is not found in plant foods. Vegetarians can get all the B12 they need from these foods, while vegans  need to supplement .

Low-Carb Friendly Plant Foods (For Both Vegetarians and Vegans)
There is actually a massive variety of  low-carb foods  from plants.
Many of these foods are also high in protein and fat.
Vegetables:  Many vegetables are low in carbs. This includes  tomatoes ,  onions , cauliflower, eggplant, bell peppers,  broccoli  and Brussels sprouts.
Fruits:  Berries like  strawberries  and blueberries can be eaten on a low-carb diet. Depending on how many carbs you want to eat, other fruits may be acceptable as well.
Fatty fruits:   Avocados  and olives are incredibly healthy. They are low in carbs but high in fat.
Nuts and seeds:  Nuts and seeds are low in carbs, but high in protein and fat. This includes almonds, walnuts, macadamia nuts,  peanuts  and pumpkin seeds.
Soy:  Foods like tofu and tempeh are high in protein and fat, but low in carbs. This makes them acceptable on a low-carb vegetarian/vegan diet.
Legumes:  Some legumes, including green beans, chick peas and others.
Healthy fats:   Extra virgin olive oil , avocado oil and  coconut oil .
Chia seeds:  Most of the carbs in  chia seeds  are fiber, so almost all of the usable calories in them come from protein and fat.
Dark chocolate:  If you choose  dark chocolate  with a high (70-85%+) cocoa content, then it will be low in carbs but high in fat.

How Many Carbs Should You Eat?
There is no fixed definition of exactly what “low carb” means.
It is important to experiment and figure out a way to match your carb intake to your own goals and preferences.
That being said, these  guidelines  are reasonable:
100-150 grams per day:  This is a decent maintenance range, and is good for people who exercise a lot.
50-100 grams per day:  This should lead to automatic weight loss, and is a good maintenance range for people who don’t exercise that much.
20-50 grams per day:  With a carb intake this low, you should  lose weight quickly  without experiencing much hunger. This carb range should put you into ketosis.
Vegetarians could easily go into the lowest range, but such a diet would be impractical for vegans. The 100-150 gram range would be more suitable for vegans.
It is recommended to use a nutrition tracker (like  Cron-o-meter ) for at least a few days/weeks while you are fine-tuning your carbohydrate intake and making sure to get enough protein and fat.
