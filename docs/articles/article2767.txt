Title: 10 Home Remedies to Get Rid of Dandruff Naturally

Tea tree oil, crushed aspirins, baking soda, and aloe vera are some of the many natural remedies you may try for dandruff. If they don’t work after 2 weeks, consider consulting a healthcare professional.
Dandruff is characterized by itchy, white flakes of skin on your scalp that may be uncomfortable.
Nearly  50%  of the global population will experience  dandruff  at least once in their life.
It may be caused by multiple factors, including:
dry skin
seborrheic dermatitis
sensitivity to hair products
the growth of a  Malassezia  yeast , which is a type of fungus
Though there are plenty of over-the-counter (OTC) products designed to treat dandruff, these 10 simple home remedies may be just as effective.

1. Tea tree oil
Historically,  tea tree oil  has been used to help treat skin conditions like  acne  and  psoriasis .
It may also have  antimicrobial  and  antifungal  properties, which could help alleviate symptoms of dandruff.
One  older review  suggests that tea tree oil is effective at fighting  Malazessia , which may cause both seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff.
Another  study  found that applying placental tissue soaked in tea tree oil to the skin was more effective than a prescription antifungal treatment for healing lesions caused by this fungus.
Despite these studies, more high quality research is needed to fully claim tea tree oil’s benefits.
Tea tree oil may also cause irritation in those with sensitive skin. Therefore, it’s best to dilute it by adding a few drops to a carrier oil such as jojoba or coconut oil before applying it directly to your skin.

2. Coconut oil
Renowned for its  multiple health benefits , coconut oil may be used as a natural remedy for dandruff.
Research  suggests  that it may improve skin hydration, prevent dryness, and decrease inflammation when applied as a moisturizer.
One older, 8-week study found that applying coconut oil to the skin reduced symptoms of  atopic dermatitis  by  68% .
In a 16-week study of 140 women, applying coconut oil to the scalp may have helped improve  the scalp microbiome  and certain markers of dandruff. However, further research is needed.
Coconut oil and its compounds have also been shown to have  antimicrobial properties  in some test-tube studies. That said, researchers have not yet examined the effects of the specific strain of fungus that causes dandruff.

3. Aloe vera
Aloe vera  is a succulent that’s often added to skin ointments, cosmetics, and lotions.
When applied to the skin, it may help treat  skin conditions  like burns, psoriasis, and cold sores.
An older review suggests that aloe vera’s antibacterial and antifungal properties may help  protect  against dandruff.
Similarly, test-tube studies suggest that aloe vera may be effective against several  species of fungi  and may help control  certain fungal infections .
Other test-tube studies suggest that aloe vera may  reduce inflammation , which could relieve dandruff symptoms.
Despite these promising results, additional studies are needed.

4. Minimize stress levels
Stress is believed to affect  many aspects  of health and wellness, influencing everything from chronic conditions to mental health.
While stress itself doesn’t cause dandruff, it may  worsen symptoms  such as dryness and itching.
One older  analysis  suggests that long-term high stress levels may also alter or suppress your immune system’s activity. This may impair your body’s ability to fight off fungal infections and skin conditions that contribute to dandruff.
In another older study of 166 people with seborrheic dermatitis, approximately  28%  reported that stress was a trigger for dermatitis symptoms.
Many different types of techniques may help you  keep stress levels under control , such as meditation, yoga, and  deep breathing .

5. Apple cider vinegar
Apple cider vinegar has been associated with a  variety of health benefits  and may be used as a natural remedy for dandruff.
The vinegar’s acidity is believed to help stimulate the shedding of dead skin cells on your scalp. Apple cider vinegar is also said to balance the pH of your skin to reduce fungal growth and thus fight dandruff.
However, no studies support these claims. Many of the supposed benefits of apple cider vinegar for dandruff are based on anecdotal evidence.
One small study of 22 people found that applying diluted apple cider vinegar to the skin topically didn’t improve eczema or skin barrier integrity. It even  worsened skin irritation .
That said, older  test-tube studies  suggest that apple cider vinegar and its compounds may prevent the growth of certain types of fungus.
If you’d like to try using apple cider vinegar, add a few tablespoons to your shampoo or combine it with just a few drops of  essential oils  and spray directly onto your hair.

6. Aspirin
Salicylic acid  is one of the primary compounds found in aspirin that’s responsible for its anti-inflammatory properties.
This acid is also an ingredient in many  anti-dandruff shampoos . It may help to get rid of scaly skin and  loosen flakes  so they can be removed.
In an older 4-week study, 19 people with dandruff used two shampoos containing either piroctone olamine and salicylic acid or  zinc pyrithione . Both shampoos decreased dandruff, but the one containing salicylic acid was  more effective  in reducing the severity of scaling.
Another small study showed that a shampoo containing salicylic acid significantly improved irritation and itching in  10 people  with scalp inflammation.
For an easy dandruff remedy, try crushing two aspirin tablets and adding the powder to your shampoo before washing your hair.

7. Omega-3s
Omega-3 fatty acids  play an important role in your body.
Not only do they make up the cell membranes that surround your cells, but they’re also crucial for the  function  of your heart, immune system, and lungs.
Omega-3s are also important for your skin health since they help manage oil production and hydration, promote wound healing, and prevent premature aging. A deficiency may cause a scaly, itchy, or rough rash to appear.
Although more research is needed, omega-3 fatty acids may also help  reduce inflammation , which may, in turn, relieve irritation and dandruff symptoms.
Foods that are  rich in omega-3  fatty acids include:
fish like salmon, trout, and mackerel
seeds like chia and flaxseed
nuts such as walnuts
You could also take a  fish oil supplement  to help increase your intake.

8. Probiotics
Probiotics  are beneficial bacteria that have been linked to  numerous health benefits , including allergy protection, lower cholesterol levels, and increased weight loss.
These bacteria may also  enhance immune function , which might help your body fight the fungal infections that cause dandruff.
One study suggests that taking probiotics for  56 days  significantly reduced dandruff severity in 60 people.
Probiotics have also been shown to help treat and prevent skin conditions such as eczema and atopic dermatitis, especially in  infants and children .
Probiotic supplements  are widely available. They may also be found in  fermented foods , such as kombucha, kimchi, and sauerkraut.

9. Baking soda
Baking soda  is a quick, convenient, and readily available dandruff remedy.
It may act as a gentle  exfoliant  to help remove dead skin cells and reduce scaling and itchiness. It also has antifungal properties that may benefit dandruff treatment.
An older test-tube study measured the antifungal effects of baking soda on some of the most common strains of fungus that cause skin infections. It suggests that baking soda completely inhibited fungal growth in  79%  of specimens after 7 days.
Another older study looked at the effects of baking soda on 31 people with psoriasis. Treatment with baking soda baths significantly reduced both itchiness and irritation after just  3 weeks .
However, more research is needed, as one study found that baking soda had  no effect  on psoriasis, skin hydration, or skin redness.
For best results, apply baking soda directly to wet hair and massage it into your scalp. Let it sit for 1–2 minutes, and then continue shampooing your hair as usual.

10. Avoid certain foods
Some people may find that limiting the consumption of certain foods could help relieve inflammation, which might help improve scalp health. However, more research is needed on the relationship between diet and dandruff.
Dietary modifications may  prevent fungal infections  by controlling yeast growth and improving the  gut microbiome , which may aid in the treatment of dandruff.
Some foods that you may  want to limit  are:
refined carbs , like white bread, pasta, and crackers
red meat
processed foods
fried foods
sugary  foods and beverages
Additionally, certain foods may also trigger flare-ups of skin conditions such as eczema, which may contribute to dandruff.
While specific trigger foods vary from person to person, some of the  most common  are white flour, gluten-containing products, and nightshades such as eggplants, peppers, and tomatoes.

Additional treatments
Additional treatment methods may be necessary if home remedies don’t help treat your dandruff.
Many OTC  medicated shampoos  and scalp treatments contain antifungal or antibacterial ingredients designed to decrease dandruff.
If these products don’t work after 2–3 weeks, you may want to consult a doctor to determine whether other prescription shampoos or medications would be beneficial.
Healthcare professionals may prescribe topical antifungal medications,  corticosteroids , or immunomodulators to help treat dandruff and other skin conditions.

Frequently asked questions
The best approach to  manage dandruff  is to use specialized shampoo and scalp treatments.
Ingredients in dandruff shampoos that  help eliminate  dandruff include zinc, selenium, and ketoconazole. If the cause is a fungal infection, you may need specialized medicine.
Using things like baking soda, probiotics, or some oils like coconut oils can help reduce dandruff naturally. Sometimes changing your diet or reducing your stress levels may also help.
Some types of dandruff may come and go, but dandruff caused by a fungal infection will need medication to treat.

Takeaway
Dandruff can be an itchy, irritating problem to deal with. However a variety of natural remedies may help reduce symptoms and provide relief.
If these natural remedies don’t help treat your symptoms of dandruff, speak with a doctor to find out whether other treatment options may be necessary to provide long-lasting relief.
