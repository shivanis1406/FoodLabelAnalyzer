Title: 11 Health Benefits of Guarana

Guarana is a plant used medicinally by Amazonian tribes for centuries. It’s found in many energy and soft drinks and may have benefits such as helping reduce fatigue, boost brain health, and protect the heart.
Guarana is a Brazilian plant native to the Amazon basin. Also known as Paullinia cupana ,  it’s a climbing plant prized for its fruit.
A mature guarana fruit is about the size of a coffee berry. It resembles the human eye, with a red shell encasing a black seed covered by a white aril. Guarana extract stems from processing the seeds into a powder.
Amazonian tribes have used guarana for centuries for its therapeutic properties.
It contains an impressive range of stimulants, such as caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine. Guarana also boasts antioxidants, such as tannins, saponins, and catechins.
Currently, the beverage industry uses 70% of guarana produced in soft and energy drinks, while the remaining 30% is turns into powder.
Here are 11 benefits of guarana, all supported by science.

1. Rich in antioxidants
Guarana  contains  compounds with  antioxidant  properties. These include  caffeine , theobromine, tannins, saponins, and catechins.
Antioxidants are important because they neutralize potentially harmful molecules called  free radicals . These molecules  can interact  with parts of your cells and cause damage linked to aging,  heart disease ,  cancers , and other diseases.
Caco-2 cell and in vitro  research  published in 2022 showed that guarana’s antioxidant properties may defend against cholesterol concentration in the body and overall aid the clinical management of cardiovascular diseases.
Guarana contains caffeine, theobromine, tannins, saponins, catechins and other compounds that have antioxidant properties.

2. Can reduce fatigue and improve focus
Guarana is best known as an ingredient in popular energy drinks. It’s an excellent source of caffeine,  which helps  you maintain focus and mental energy.
Caffeine works by blocking the effects of adenosine, a compound that helps your brain relax. It binds to adenosine receptors,  preventing them  from being activated.
Guarana is rich in caffeine, which can reduce fatigue and improve focus. Caffeine blocks the effects of adenosine, a compound that makes you feel drowsy and helps your brain relax.

3. May help you learn better
A 2023  review of research  indicated that guarana given over a short period may have an impact on cognitive performance. However, researchers note that it’s unknown if that impact is due to substances in guarana, such as caffeine.
They recommend additional research that involves a more in-depth look at those specific substances, including using equal doses of each when evaluating their effect on cognitive performance.
Low doses of guarana may aid cognitive performance.

4. May promote weight loss
According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , an estimated 2 in 5 adults living in the United States has obesity.
Obesity is a growing concern and is linked to many chronic diseases, including  heart disease ,  type 2 diabetes,  and cancer.  Guarana may have properties that help promote  weight loss .
A  2019 study  involved feeding rats either a Western or low fat diet with or without guarana supplementation over 18 weeks.
Results showed eating patterns with guarana supplementation prevented biological effects such as weight gain,  insulin resistance , and adipokine dysregulation, which is a condition that leads to obesity and cardiovascular issues.
However, guarana’s effects on fat cell production as well as overall safety in humans remain unclear.
Guarana contains caffeine, which may aid weight loss by boosting metabolism. It has also been found to suppress genes that aid fat cell production and promote genes that slow it down. However, more human-based studies are necessary.

5. May relieve chronic diarrhea and treat constipation
People in various parts of the world use guarana as a natural stomach tonic to treat digestive problems like chronic diarrhea and constipation. It  may have  anti-diarrhea properties because it’s rich in tannins or plant-based antioxidants.
On the other hand, guarana is rich in caffeine, which may act as a  natural laxative .
Caffeine stimulates peristalsis, which  activates  contractions in your intestines and colon muscles. This may relieve constipation by pushing contents to the rectum.
Low doses of guarana do not provide much caffeine, so they are more likely to have an anti-diarrhea effect. High doses provide more caffeine and may have laxative effects.
The caffeine in guarana may relieve constipation by stimulating contractions in your intestines and colon that push contents toward the rectum.

6. May boost heart health
The CDC reports that heart disease is responsible for  1 in 5 deaths  in the United States. Guarana may reduce the risk of heart disease in two ways.
First, guarana’s antioxidants  may aid  blood flow and prevent blood clots.
Second, in vitro and in Caco-2 cellular  research  published in 2022 indicates that guarana may decrease LDL “bad” cholesterol oxidation. Oxidized LDL cholesterol can contribute to plaque buildup in your arteries.
Guarana may aid heart health by improving blood flow and preventing blood clots. Research also indicates that it may be helpful in decreasing the oxidation of LDL “bad” cholesterol.

7. May provide pain relief
Historically, Amazonian tribes used guarana as a pain reliever. Its pain-relieving properties are due to its high caffeine content.
Caffeine  plays a role  in pain management by binding and blocking adenosine receptors. Two of these receptors, A1 and A2a, stimulate feelings of pain.
When caffeine binds to these receptors, it can reduce sensations of pain.
This is one reason caffeine is  commonly found  in many over-the-counter pain relief medications. Studies have shown it can significantly enhance their effects.
The caffeine in guarana may provide pain relief by blocking adenosine receptors, which stimulate feelings of pain.

8. May improve skin appearance
Due to its strong antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, guarana is popular in the cosmetics industry as an ingredient in creams, lotions, soaps, and hair products.
Moreover, its caffeine content  may aid  blood flow to the skin. Caffeine is metabolized in the body into certain pharmacologic agents, such as theobromine. Theobromine expands blood vessels, increasing blood flow, which is important for the skin’s function. However, higher quality studies are still necessary to fully determine the effects of caffeine on the skin.
Guarana has antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, making it a common additive in cosmetic products. It may aid blood flow to your skin.

9. Has antibacterial properties
Guarana  contains many compounds  that may inhibit or kill harmful  bacteria . One bacteria type is  Escherichia coli (E. coli) , which lives in the intestines of humans and animals. Most E. coli bacteria are harmless, but some can cause diarrhea or illness.
Guarana contains compounds that may inhibit or kill harmful bacteria, such as E. coli.

10. May protect against age-related eye disorders
Vision changes often occur during the natural aging process. Sunlight, dietary issues, and certain lifestyle choices, such as smoking,  can negatively affect  your eyes over time and increase your risk of eye-related disorders.
Guarana contains compounds that fight oxidative stress, a  major risk factor  for age-related eye disorders like macular degeneration, cataracts, and glaucoma.
One  2017 study  found that people who regularly consumed guarana had better self-reported vision than those who consumed it sparingly.
That said, limited research exists on guarana and age-related eye disorders. More human-based studies are necessary.
Studies have found that guarana may defend against oxidative stress, which links to age-related eye disorders. However, there are limits to this area of research, so more human-based studies are necessary before providing recommendations.

11. Safe with few side effects
Guarana has an excellent safety profile and is widely available.
Research  shows that guarana has low toxicity in low to moderate doses.
In high doses, guarana may cause side effects similar to those of  excessive caffeine intake ,  including :
heart palpitations
insomnia
headaches
seizures
anxiety
nervousness
upset stomach
shakiness
It’s worth noting that caffeine  can be addictive , and in high doses, it can lead to dependency.
Pregnant people should avoid or limit guarana intake, as caffeine  can cross  the placenta. Too much caffeine may cause growth abnormalities in your child or increase the risk of miscarriage.
Guarana appears to be safe and is widely available. In high doses, it may have similar side effects to those of excessive caffeine intake.

Takeaway
Guarana is a popular ingredient in many energy and soft drinks. Amazonian tribes have used it for its therapeutic effects for centuries.
Guarana is commonly touted for its ability to reduce fatigue, boost energy, and aid learning and memory. It also links to better heart health, weight loss, pain relief, healthier skin, lower cancer risk, and a decreased risk of age-related eye diseases.
It’s widely available as a supplement and can be easily added to your diet. Whether you want to boost your energy levels or improve your overall health, guarana may be worth trying. When considering any type of supplementation, it’s important to talk with a healthcare professional to learn more about whether it’s a suitable and safe option for you.
