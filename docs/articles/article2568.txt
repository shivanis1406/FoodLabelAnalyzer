Title: 9 Teas to Soothe an Upset Stomach

Several varieties of tea, including ginger tea, have been shown to relieve an upset stomach by treating issues like nausea, diarrhea, bloating, or vomiting.
When your stomach is upset, sipping on a hot cup of tea is a simple way to ease your symptoms.
Still, the type of tea may make a big difference.
In fact, certain varieties have been shown to treat issues like nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.
Here are 9 teas to soothe an upset stomach.

1. Green tea
Green tea has been heavily researched for its many potential  health benefits .
It was historically used as a natural remedy for diarrhea and infection from  typhoid , a foodborne illness that causes nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
It may relieve other stomach issues as well.
For example,  one study  found that green tea extract significantly improved diarrhea and decreased the duration of hospitalization in children with viral gastroenteritis, or stomach flu.
In animal  studies , green tea and its components have also been shown to treat  stomach ulcers , which can cause issues like pain, gas, and indigestion.
Keep in mind that some people report  feeling nauseous  after drinking strongly brewed green tea on an empty stomach. To prevent this, stick to the recommended brewing time and drink your tea with a small snack.
Green tea may help heal stomach ulcers and treat issues like diarrhea when consumed in moderation

2. Ginger tea
Ginger tea is made by boiling ginger root in water.
This root may be incredibly beneficial for digestive issues like nausea and vomiting.
According to  one review ,  ginger  helped prevent morning sickness in pregnant people, as well as nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy.
Another review  noted that ginger can reduce gas, bloating, cramps, and indigestion while also supporting bowel regularity.
Although most of these studies looked at high dose ginger supplements,  ginger tea  may provide many of the same benefits.
To make it, grate a knob of peeled ginger and steep it in boiling water for 10–20 minutes. Strain and enjoy alone or with a bit of lemon, honey, or  cayenne pepper .
Ginger tea can help prevent a variety of digestive issues, including nausea, vomiting, gas, bloating, cramps, and indigestion.

3. Peppermint tea
Peppermint tea is a common choice when tummy troubles start to strike.
Animal studies  reveal that  peppermint oil  can relax intestinal muscles and help relieve pain.
Furthermore,  a review  of 14 studies in 1,927 people suggested that peppermint oil reduced the duration, frequency, and severity of stomach pain in children.
This oil has even been  shown to prevent  chemotherapy-related  nausea  and vomiting.
Some  studies  indicate that simply smelling peppermint oil helps prevent nausea and vomiting.
Although these studies focus on the oil rather than the tea itself,  peppermint tea  may provide similar benefits.
You can buy this tea at grocery stores or make your own by steeping crushed peppermint leaves in hot water for 7–12 minutes.
Peppermint tea may help treat stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. Peppermint oil is also very soothing.

4. Black tea
Black tea  boasts a set of health benefits similar to that of green tea, especially for soothing an upset stomach.
It may be especially effective at treating diarrhea.
In fact, in a  study  in 120 children, taking a black tea tablet helped improve the volume, frequency, and consistency of bowel movements.
Additionally, an older  27-day study  noted that giving black tea extract to piglets infected with  E. coli  — a type of bacteria that can cause digestive issues — reduced the prevalence of diarrhea by 20%.
However, more research in humans is needed.
Much like green tea, black tea may help reduce diarrhea when consumed in moderation.

5. Fennel tea
Fennel is a plant in the carrot family with a burst of licorice-like flavor.
Tea from this flowering plant is commonly used to treat a variety of ailments, including stomachaches,  constipation , gas, and diarrhea.
In a  2014 study  in 80 people, taking a fennel supplement for several days before and during menstruation decreased symptoms like nausea.
A  test-tube study  also found that fennel extract blocked the growth of several strains of bacteria, such as harmful  E. coli .
Another older study  in 159 people revealed that fennel tea promoted digestive regularity, as well as gut recovery after surgery.
Try making  fennel tea  at home by pouring 1 cup, or 237 milliliters (mL), of hot water over 1 teaspoon, or 2 grams (g), of dried  fennel seeds . You can otherwise steep the roots or leaves of the fennel plant in hot water for 5–10 minutes before straining.
Fennel tea has antibacterial properties and has been shown to decrease conditions like nausea. It may also relieve menstruation symptoms and promote bowel regularity.

6. Licorice tea
Licorice  is famous for its distinctly sweet, slightly bitter flavor.
Many forms of traditional medicine have utilized this  legume  to settle stomach upset.
Multiple older  studies  indicate that licorice helps heal stomach ulcers, which can trigger symptoms like stomach pain, nausea, and indigestion — a condition that causes stomach discomfort and  heartburn .
Notably, a  2012 month-long study  in 54 people showed that taking 75 milligrams (mg) of licorice extract twice daily significantly decreased indigestion.
Still, additional research is needed on licorice tea specifically.
This tea can be purchased at many supermarkets, as well as online. It’s often combined with other ingredients in  herbal tea blends .
Keep in mind that licorice root is linked to several side effects and can be dangerous in high amounts. Therefore, stick to 1 cup (237 mL) of licorice tea per day and consult a healthcare professional if you have any medical conditions.
Licorice tea may help heal stomach ulcers and decrease indigestion, though more research is needed. Make sure to consume no more than 1 cup (237 mL) per day.

7. Chamomile tea
Chamomile tea  is light, flavorful, and often considered one of the most soothing types of tea.
It’s often used to relax your digestive muscles and treat issues like gas, indigestion, motion sickness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
In a  study  in 65 people, taking 500 mg of chamomile extract twice daily reduced the frequency of vomiting caused by chemotherapy, compared with a control group.
Another  older study  in rats also found that chamomile extract prevented diarrhea.
While these studies tested high amounts of chamomile extract, the tea made from these daisy-like  flowers  may also relieve stomach problems.
To make it, steep a premade tea bag or 1 tablespoon (2 g) of dried chamomile leaves in 1 cup (237 mL) of hot water for 5 minutes.
Chamomile tea may help prevent vomiting and diarrhea, as well as several other digestive issues.

8. Holy basil tea
Also known as tulsi, holy basil is a  powerful herb  long revered for its medicinal properties.
Although not as common as other teas, it’s a great option to soothe an  upset stomach .
Multiple  animal studies  have determined that holy basil protects against stomach ulcers, which can cause a wide range of symptoms, including stomach pain, heartburn, and nausea.
In fact, in  one older animal study ,  holy basil  reduced the incidence of stomach ulcers and enhanced the healing of existing ulcers within 20 days of treatment.
Still, more studies are needed.
Holy basil tea bags can be found at many health stores, as well as online. You can also use dried holy basil powder to brew a fresh cup yourself.
Animal studies show that holy basil can help protect against stomach ulcers, reducing symptoms like stomach pain, heartburn, and nausea.

9. Spearmint tea
Like peppermint, spearmint may help relieve digestive distress.
It boasts a compound called  carvone , which helps reduce muscle contractions in your digestive tract.
In an older  8-week study , 32 people with  irritable bowel syndrome  (IBS) were given a product containing spearmint, coriander, and lemon balm alongside diarrhea or constipation medication.
Those taking the spearmint product reported significantly less stomach pain, discomfort, and bloating than those in the control group.
However, the supplement contained multiple ingredients, not just spearmint.
Also, a  2015 test-tube study  noted that this mint blocked the growth of several bacteria strains that may contribute to foodborne illness and tummy troubles.
Still, more human research is needed.
Spearmint tea  is easy to make at home. Simply bring 1 cup (237 mL) of water to a boil, remove it from heat, and add a handful of spearmint leaves. Steep for 5 minutes, then strain and serve.
Spearmint tea may help reduce stomach pain and bloating. It may also kill certain strains of bacteria that are responsible for food poisoning.

The bottom line
Research shows that tea provides many health-promoting properties.
In fact, many  types of tea  can help settle an upset stomach.
Whether you’re experiencing nausea, indigestion,  bloating , or cramps, brewing one of these delicious beverages is a simple way to get you back to feeling your best.
