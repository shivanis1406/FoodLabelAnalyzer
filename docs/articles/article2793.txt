Title: The 9 Best Foods and Drinks to Have Before Bed

If the thought of sleep gives you nightmares, look at what you’re eating. The best foods to eat before bed might be able to offer you a much better night.
Getting good sleep can help  reduce your chance  of developing certain chronic illnesses, keep your brain healthy, and boost your immune system.
For this reason, it’s generally recommended that you get between  7-8 hours  of uninterrupted sleep each night, though many people have a hard time getting enough.
There are many  strategies that help promote good sleep , including making changes to your diet, as some foods and drinks have sleep-promoting properties. It’s also helpful to have your meals at  consistent times  daily.
Here are the 9 best foods and drinks you can have before bed to enhance your quality of sleep.

1. Almonds
Almonds are an  excellent source  of many nutrients. Eating them regularly  may help reduce  the chance of diseases like type 2 diabetes and heart disease. This is  attributed  to their healthy monounsaturated fats, fiber, and antioxidants.
They may also help boost sleep quality. For one, thet contain  vitamin B  and  magnesium , which can help promote better sleep. Consuming adequate amounts of magnesium, in particular,  may help  improve sleep quality if you have have insomnia.
In addition, along with several other types of nuts, almonds are a  source  of the hormone melatonin, which regulates your internal clock and signals your body to prepare for sleep.
One study examining the effects of feeding rats 400 milligrams (mg) of almond extract found that the rats slept longer and  more deeply  than they did without consuming almond extract.
That said, more extensive human studies are needed to verify these findings.

2. Turkey
Turkey  is delicious, nutritious, and high in protein, which is  important  for keeping your muscles strong and regulating your appetite. It also contains other nutrients like riboflavin, phosphorus, and selenium.
It also contains the amino acid tryptophan, which  increases  the production of melatonin and can have an drowsiness affect.
The protein in turkey may also contribute to its ability to promote tiredness. There’s  evidence  that consuming moderate amounts of  protein before bed  is  associated  with better sleep quality, including less waking up throughout the night.
That said, more research is necessary to confirm turkey’s potential role in improving sleep.

3. Chamomile tea
Chamomile tea is a popular herbal tea that may offer a variety of health benefits.
It’s well known for its flavones.  Flavones  are a class of antioxidants that reduce the inflammation that often leads to chronic diseases, such as cancer and heart disease. In addition, chamomile tea has some unique properties that  may help improve  sleep quality.
Specifically, chamomile tea contains  apigenin.  This antioxidant binds to certain receptors in your brain that may promote sleepiness and reduce insomnia.
A  2017 study  on older adults found that those who consumed 400 milligrams (mg) of oral capsules of chamomile twice daily for 4 weeks slept better than those who didn’t.
That said, more current research on chamomile tea specifically and sleep may be needed.

4. Kiwi
Kiwis  are a low-calorie and very nutritious fruit, and eating them may benefit your digestive health, reduce inflammation, and lower your cholesterol. These effects are due to the  high amounts  of fiber and carotenoid antioxidants that they provide.
Kiwis may also be one of the best foods to eat before bed. The sleep-promoting effects of kiwis are sometimes attributed to serotonin. Serotonin is a brain chemical that helps regulate your sleep cycle. Eating a diet rich in fruit like kiwis  may help  promote better sleep.
It’s also been suggested that the anti-inflammatory antioxidants in kiwis, such as vitamin C,  may be  partly responsible for their sleep-promoting effects.
However, more scientific evidence is needed to determine the effects that kiwis may have in improving sleep.

5. Tart cherry juice
Tart cherry juice  provides modest amounts of a few important nutrients, such as magnesium phosphorus, and potassium. Additionally, it’s a  rich source  of antioxidants.
Tart cherry juice is also known to promote sleepiness due to its high amounts of melatonin, and it’s even  been studied  for its role in relieving insomnia. For these reasons, drinking tart cherry juice before bed may improve your sleep quality.
That said, more extensive research is necessary to confirm the role of tart cherry juice in improving sleep and preventing insomnia.

6. Fatty fish
Fatty fish , such as salmon, tuna, trout, and mackerel, are incredibly healthy. What makes them unique is their exceptional amounts of vitamin D.
For example, a 3-ounce (85-gram) serving of sockeye salmon contains 570 international units (IU) of vitamin D. That’s 71% of your DV. A similar serving of farmed rainbow trout contains 81% of your DV.
Additionally, fatty fish are high in healthy omega-3 fatty acids, specifically  eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) , which are known for reducing inflammation. In combination with the vitamin D in fatty fish, Omega-3 fatty acids  may help protect  against heart disease and boost brain health.

7. Walnuts
Walnuts  are a popular type of tree nut abundant in nutrients and a great source of healthy fats, including omega-3 fatty acids and linoleic acid.
Walnuts  have been studied  for their ability to reduce high cholesterol levels, which are a major risk factor for heart disease.
What’s more, some  researchers  claim that eating walnuts improves sleep quality, as they’re one of the best food sources of melatonin.
The fatty acid makeup of walnuts may also contribute to better sleep, according to a  study on mice . More human studies are needed to support the claims about walnuts improving sleep.

8. Passionflower tea
Passionflower tea is another herbal tea that’s been traditionally used to treat a number of health ailments.
It’s a  rich source  of flavonoid antioxidants, which are known for their role in reducing inflammation.
Additionally, passionflower tea  has been studied  for its potential to reduce the symptons of anxiety, depression, and other psychiatric disorers.
Specifically, the  results of a small study  suggest that passionflower increases the production of the brain chemical gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA works to inhibit other brain chemicals that induce stress, such as glutamate.
The calming properties of passionflower tea may promote sleepiness, so it may be beneficial to drink it before going to bed.

9. White rice
White rice is a grain that’s widely consumed as a staple food in many countries.
The major difference between white and brown rice is that white rice has had its bran and germ removed. This makes it lower in fiber, nutrients, and antioxidants.
Nevertheless, white rice still contains a decent amount of a few vitamins and minerals.
White rice  is high in carbs. Its carb content and lack of fiber contribute to its high glycemic index (GI).
It’s been suggested in  older research  that eating foods with a high GI, such as white rice, at least 1 hour before bed may help improve sleep quality. That said, this research was based on professional athletes who may need to consume more cabrs than the average person.
A  2020 review  suggests, however, that the evidence that high GI foods can help with sleep is mixed and more study is necessary.

Other foods and drinks that may promote sleep
Several other foods and drinks have sleep-promoting properties. For example, they may contain high amounts of nutrients such as tryptophan.
However, in some cases, there’s little research into their specific effects on sleep.
Dairy products:  Dairy products, such as a glass of milk, cottage cheese, and plain yogurt, are  known sources  of tryptophan. Milk has been shown to improve sleep in older adults, especially when paired with light exercise.
Bananas:  Banana are a modest source of magnesium. This  may help  you get a good night’s sleep.
Oatmeal:  Similar to rice, oatmeal is high in carbs with a bit more fiber and has been reported to induce drowsiness when consumed before bed. Additionally, oats are a  known source  of melatonin.

Frequently asked questions
While eating any of the foods suggested in this article may help improve your sleep quality, there is some debate whether eating them right before bed is ideal. There’s research suggesting that eating too close to bedtime can actually interfere with sleep, and that eating  4-6 hours  before going to bed is better.
Eggs  do contain a lot of protein, and protein  has been shown  to have a positive influence on sleep. For this reason having eggs for dinner may have positive influenc on your sleep.
Research  suggests that eating sugary foods might have a negative influence on sleep. Similarly, you should  try to avoid  eating spicy or processed foods. Also, it’s a good idea to avoid caffeine and alcohol close to bed time, as these can disrupt sleep.

The bottom line
Getting enough sleep is very important for your health.
Several foods and drinks may help. This is because they contain sleep-regulating hormones and brain chemicals, such as melatonin and serotonin.
Some foods and drinks contain high amounts of specific antioxidants and nutrients, such as magnesium and melatonin, that are known to enhance sleep by helping you fall asleep faster or stay asleep longer.
To reap the benefits of sleep-enhancing foods and drinks, it may be best to consume them 2–3 hours before bed. Eating immediately before going to sleep may cause digestive issues, such as acid reflux. In addition, eating on a regular schedule can help promot better digestion, which may support better sleep.
Overall, more research is necessary to conclude the specific role that foods and drinks have in promoting sleep, but their known effects are very promising. The  National Sleep Foundation  contains additional resources on diet and sleep.
