Title: 7 Impressive Benefits of Eucalyptus Leaves

Eucalyptus leaves may have therapeutic benefits, from reducing discomfort to freshening breath. You can drink eucalyptus tea but avoid eucalyptus oil as it can be harmful even in small amounts.
Eucalyptus is an evergreen tree that’s widely used for its medicinal properties. Although native to Australia, this popular tree now grows in many areas worldwide.
It has a gum-infused bark, long stems, and circular leaves that are hard to digest if eaten whole.
However, eucalyptus leaves can be made into a tea that’s safe for consumption and essential oil for topical use or inhalation.
Here are 7 impressive benefits of eucalyptus leaves.

1. High in antioxidants
Eucalyptus leaves are a great source of  antioxidants , which help protect your body from  oxidative stress  and free radical damage.
Some of the main antioxidants in eucalyptus  include :
catechin
quercetin
gallic acid
p-hydroxybenzoic acid
syringic acid
vanillic acid
rutin
luteolin
apigenin
Research suggests that diets rich in these compounds  may help  protect against:
certain  cancers
heart disease
mental health conditions
neurodegenerative conditions
Eucalyptus tea is a good source of these antioxidants and generally recognized as safe for adults. However, children are at  high risk  of eucalyptus toxicity and should get approval from a healthcare professional before drinking this tea.

2. May relieve cold symptoms
Eucalyptus is  widely used  as a natural cold remedy due to its anti-inflammatory and mucus-relieving properties. It’s often used to help relieve symptoms from conditions like:
common cold
nasal congestion
sinusitis
bronchitis
asthma
flu
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
The main ingredient responsible for these properties is eucalyptol, also known as cineole, which is a compound found in eucalyptus oil.
Eucalyptus is also a main ingredient in ointments like  Vicks VapoRub , which also contains camphor and menthol. This ointment is  primarily used  to relieve coughs, but it may  also help  with nasal congestion by decreasing inflammation and mucus buildup.
Eucalyptus oil may be inhaled through your nose or applied topically to relieve cold symptoms.
However, it’s important to avoid consuming the oil because it could have toxic effects.

3. May treat dry skin
Using eucalyptus may help improve  dry skin  by increasing its ceramide content.
Ceramides  are a type of fatty acid in your skin responsible for maintaining its barrier and retaining moisture. People who experience dry skin, dandruff, or skin disorders like dermatitis and psoriasis usually have lower ceramide levels.
A  2024 review  suggests topical eucalyptus leaf extract may help boost skin ceramide production, water-holding capacity, and skin barrier protection.
A  2018 study  in 34 people with  atopic dermatitis ,  seborrheic dermatitis , or  tinea capitis  also found that using a scalp lotion containing eucalyptus leaf extract and synthetic ceramide decreased scalp redness, itchiness, dryness, and scaliness.
Hence, many hair and skin products contain eucalyptus leaf extract.

4. May reduce pain
Inhaling eucalyptus essential oil may help decrease pain due to its anti-inflammatory and analgesic compounds.
A  2022 study  in 70 people with rheumatoid arthritis found that inhaling 1 milliliter (mL) of eucalyptus oil for 5 minutes, three times daily for 1 month, helped relieve pain alongside other conventional treatments.
However, a  2019 study  in 123 people with cancer found no improvements in perceived pain after inhaling three drops of eucalyptus oil for 3 minutes prior to a medical procedure, suggesting that more research is needed.

5. May promote relaxation
Eucalyptus is widely believed to  decrease symptoms of stress .
A small  2022 study  found that inhaling eucalyptus oil helped increase brain spectrums associated with relaxation and rest.
Similarly, a  2014 study  in 62 people found that inhaling eucalyptus oil helped reduce pre-surgery anxiety.
The stress-relieving properties of eucalyptus may be due to eucalyptol. This may decrease the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and increase the activity of your  parasympathetic nervous system , which promotes relaxation.

6. Can help keep your teeth healthy
Eucalyptus is one of the most commonly used essential oils for oral health because it may have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.
A  2022 review  found that eucalyptus may help fight against Streptococcus mutans, a bacteria associated with  cavities ,  tooth decay , and  enamel breakdown .
The authors also note that eucalyptus is used in some wound dressings to help relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and prevent infection.
A  2024 study  in 60 people found that eucalyptus-based dentifrice may help reduce gum bleeding and dental plaque, which may lead to cavities.

7. Can act as a natural insect repellent
Eucalyptus oil may be a natural insect repellent, mainly due to its eucalyptol content.
A  2021 study  found that a combination of eucalyptus and clove essential oils strongly prevented mosquitoes from landing on the skin.
According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , lemon eucalyptus oil ⁠— derived from the lemon eucalyptus tree ⁠— is an ingredient used in several approved and powerful insect repellants.
That said, the  CDC  warns against using pure eucalyptus essential oil on the skin because it hasn’t been tested for efficacy and possible side effects.
Eucalyptus products may be effective at repelling mosquitoes and other biting insects for up to  2 hours  after topical application.

How to use eucalyptus
Eucalyptus leaves can be found online and used in a variety of ways:
Tea:  Use tea bags made from ground eucalyptus leaves.
Aromatherapy:  Add a few drops of eucalyptus  essential oil  to a diffuser or steam bowl.
Whole leaves:  Hang the leaves in your shower or add them to your bath for a relaxing spa-like experience.
Bug repellent:  Purchase or make a bug repellent with lemon eucalyptus essential oil.
Topical:  To ease congestion, add a few drops of eucalyptus oil to a carrier oil, such as fractionated coconut oil, and apply it to your chest.
It’s important not to ingest eucalyptus oil, which can be toxic if consumed. Choose a tea that’s labeled “eucalyptus leaves tea,” and don’t add eucalyptus essential oil to your tea.
Many over-the-counter products also contain eucalyptus, such as mouthwash, vapor rub, and chewing gum.

Eucalyptus precautions
While eucalyptus leaves are generally recognized as safe, consuming eucalyptus oil can pose some serious health risks.
Some  possible side effects  of taking eucalyptus oil by mouth may include:
nausea
vomiting
diarrhea
abdominal pain
dizziness
muscle weakness
drowsiness
seizures
coma
Consuming  3.5 mL  of eucalyptus essential oil may also lead to toxicity and death.
Eucalyptus oil isn’t safe for children, and there’s not enough evidence to determine whether it’s safe for people who are pregnant or nursing.
Speak with a healthcare professional before using eucalyptus oil, especially if you have a skin condition or you take certain medications. Eucalyptus oil may interact with some drugs and reduce their efficacy or lead to side effects.

The bottom line
Eucalyptus leaves have many impressive benefits. They may help decrease pain, promote relaxation, and relieve cold symptoms.
Many over-the-counter products also use eucalyptus extract to freshen your breath, soothe irritated skin, and repel insects.
Eucalyptus tea is considered safe to drink, but ingesting eucalyptus oil can be toxic in relatively low doses. Always speak with a doctor before using eucalyptus oil if you’re taking any medications.
