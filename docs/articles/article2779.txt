Title: A Dietitian’s Picks of the 3 Best Choline Supplements

Choline is a water-soluble nutrient that your body needs to maintain typical functioning. While your liver can make small amounts of choline, you must get most of your choline from your diet ( 1 ).
Although many foods — including eggs, salmon, cauliflower, broccoli, and beef — contain choline, some people may not be able to fulfill their choline needs through diet alone ( 2 ).
This article lists the 3 best choline supplements, according to dietitians.

A quick look at our picks of the best choline supplements
Best overall:  Jarrow Formulas Citicoline (CDP Choline)
Best affordable:   NOW Supplements Choline & Inositol
Best with phosphatidylcholine:  Double Wood Supplements Phosphatidylcholine

What is choline?
Choline  is a water-soluble essential nutrient. It’s not considered a vitamin or a mineral but is often grouped with the B vitamins because it has some similarities to them.
This nutrient is involved in several essential bodily processes that affect the health and development of your heart, liver, brain, and nervous system. It also plays an essential role in muscle contractions ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ).

How much choline do you need?
There’s currently not enough evidence to establish a Recommended Dietary Allowance for choline.
Instead, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine has established Adequate Intake (AI) levels, which indicate the amount of choline that is assumed to be adequate for individual health ( 2 ).
Current AIs for choline in teens and adults are as follows:
Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has created a Daily Value (DV) for choline to be used on food and supplement packaging.
The current DV for choline is 550 milligrams (mg) for all people over age 4 ( 2 ).
However, keep in mind that the optimal amount of choline for you may vary depending on your current health needs. You can talk with a healthcare professional about how much choline you should be getting through diet or supplements.

Who should take a choline supplement?
Most healthy adults can meet their choline needs through diet alone. However, some people may have greater choline needs or be more likely to have a  deficiency in this nutrient .
While more research is needed, people who may benefit from a choline supplement include ( 3 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ):
those who are pregnant or nursing
endurance athletes
those who have certain genetic variations
It’s important to discuss supplements with a trusted healthcare professional before trying them. In addition to helping you decide whether a choline supplement may be right for you, they can recommend an appropriate dose.

Double Wood Supplements Phosphatidylcholine is a third-party tested supplement containing a form of choline that may be beneficial for supporting liver function.
Phosphatidylcholine  is a form of choline that is naturally found in foods such as  eggs , soybeans, nuts, fish, and meat.
While more human research is necessary, current studies suggest that phosphatidylcholine intake may play a role in preserving or improving the ability to think and reducing the risk of dementia ( 14 ,  15 ).
Additionally, limited research has found phosphatidylcholine supplements to be effective for improving measures of liver function in adults with  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)  ( 16 ,  17 ).
In addition to being third-party tested by Nutra Solutions and VITA-gen Laboratories, Double Wood Supplements products are manufactured in U.S.-based CGMP-compliant facilities.

A comparison of the best choline supplements
Here’s a quick look at how our top picks compare:

How to choose a choline supplement
When shopping for a choline supplement, it’s important to consider several factors:
Choline form:  Although more research is needed on this topic, some forms of choline may be better for certain uses than others. For example, CDP-choline may be more effective for supporting ability to think ( 8 ).
Dose:  The amount of choline that you should take in supplement form varies based on the type of choline in the supplement, as well as your age, current diet, and reason for taking the supplement.
Supplement type:  Some types of supplements are easier to swallow than others. Choose a product that you feel comfortable taking.
Quality and brand reputation:  Because the FDA does not regulate supplements in the same way as pharmaceuticals, it’s important to  choose a quality product that is produced by a reputable brand  and third-party tested to ensure purity and potency.

Safety and side effects
As with most supplements, it is important not to consume more than the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of choline.
Additionally, to reduce the risk of side effects, you should not consume more than the AI of choline unless a healthcare professional advises it.
The current ULs for choline are as follows ( 2 ):
People who exceed the UL for choline may experience the following symptoms ( 2 ):
vomiting
liver toxicity
low blood pressure
excessive sweating and salivation
fishy body odor
Before taking a choline supplement, talk with a healthcare professional to determine the right dose and product for your needs.

Frequently asked questions
Research on the differences among the forms of choline found in supplements is lacking. However, some studies suggest that certain forms may be easier to absorb or better for certain purposes.
For example, citicoline (CDP-choline) may be more effective for brain health because of its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, whereas phosphatidylcholine has been shown to be beneficial for supporting liver health in people with NAFLD ( 8 ,  18 ,  19 ).
People who may benefit from taking choline supplements include those who are pregnant or nursing and those who have a genetic variation that makes it harder to meet choline needs through diet alone.
People who have dietary restrictions or difficulties with nutrient absorption may benefit from taking a  multivitamin  that contains choline.
Always consult a healthcare professional before taking any new supplements. They can determine the appropriate product and dosage for you.
Choline supplements are safe to take daily, though they aren’t necessary for everyone.
If a healthcare professional has recommended that you take a choline supplement, make sure to consume only the recommended dose.
Yes. To avoid potentially dangerous side effects, adults should not consume more than 3,500 mg of choline from supplements per day ( 2 ).
Potential side effects of excess choline intake include liver toxicity, vomiting, low blood pressure, fishy body odor, and excess sweating and saliva production.
Choline is an essential nutrient for fetal brain development, and research suggests that increased choline intake during pregnancy may positively affect a child’s memory, thinking ability, behavior, and even chronic disease risk later in life ( 20 ).

The bottom line
Choline is an essential nutrient that affects liver, brain, and heart health. It also plays an essential role in fetal brain development ( 1 ).
Because  several foods  contain choline, many people can meet their choline needs through diet alone.
If you’re pregnant, nursing, or generally worried that you’re not getting enough choline in your diet, it’s important to talk with a healthcare professional about whether a choline supplement is right for you.
