Title: Can Pregnant Women Eat Blue Cheese?

Blue cheese — sometimes spelled “bleu cheese” — is known for its blueish hue and potent smell and flavor. You’ll regularly find this popular dairy product in salad dressings and sauces, or served alongside fruit and nuts or other cheeses.
Some of the most common varieties are Stilton, Roquefort, and Gorgonzola ( 1 ).
Still, because it’s a mold-ripened cheese often made with unpasteurized milk, you may wonder whether it’s safe to eat during pregnancy.
This article explains whether pregnant women can eat blue cheese.

Blue cheese may carry Listeria
The risks of eating blue cheese during pregnancy have nothing to do with the fact that this dairy product is manufactured using mold, as these specific molds are safe to consume.
Instead, because most blue cheese is made with unpasteurized milk, it carries a higher risk of contamination with  Listeria monocytogenes .
This bacterium can cause listeriosis, a  foodborne illness  that presents much like the flu or stomach bug ( 2 ).
Some of the most common listeriosis symptoms in pregnant women are fever, aches and pains, digestive upset, and headaches. More severe symptoms include stiff neck, confusion, convulsions, and loss of balance ( 3 ).
These may be a sign that  Listeria  has entered into the mother’s nervous system, where it can cause bacterial meningitis, or inflammation around the brain and spinal cord ( 4 ,  5 ).
Listeriosis symptoms are often  mild for pregnant women , and many may not even realize they have it. However,  Listeria  can cross the placenta and may be fatal to your unborn baby ( 3 ).
While listeriosis is fairly rare, pregnant women are up to 20 times likelier to get it than the general population ( 6 ).
Pasteurization, which uses mild heat to partially sterilized certain foods, kills  Listeria . However, relatively few blue cheeses are pasteurized, leaving it at a higher risk of bacterial contamination.
Keep in mind that cooking can kill  Listeria . As such, thoroughly cooked dishes, such as  pizza  with blue cheese, are likely safe to eat while pregnant.
One study using raw milk showed that temperatures of 131°F (55°C) significantly reduced the activity of  Listeria  ( 7 ).
Though less common, some blue cheeses are made with pasteurized milk. You can tell by looking at the product label.
If you’re pregnant, you should avoid any blue cheese that includes  raw milk . Unpasteurized dairy products are required by law to have a disclosure in most U.S. states.
Blue cheese dressings often combine blue cheese with mayonnaise, buttermilk, sour cream, vinegar, milk, and onion and garlic powder, though other variations exist.
The milk and blue cheese in this  dressing  may be at risk of  Listeria  contamination. Blue cheese dressing may or may not be made using pasteurized ingredients.
To be on the safe side, pregnant women may wish to avoid blue cheese dressing. If you decide to buy it, select a product that has been pasteurized.
As it’s often made with unpasteurized milk, blue cheese increases your risk of  Listeria  poisoning, which is extremely dangerous for unborn babies. If you’re pregnant, it’s best to avoid blue cheese products or only buy ones that use pasteurized milk.

What to do if you’ve eaten blue cheese while pregnant
Symptoms of  Listeria  poisoning typically appear within a few days of eating the contaminated food. However, some people may not experience symptoms for up to 30 days.
If you’re pregnant and have eaten blue cheese, don’t panic. Monitor your health and look for symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, or a fever above 100.5°F (38°C) ( 9 ).
Call your healthcare provider if you start to feel sick or think you may have  listeriosis symptoms .
A blood test can be performed to confirm the infection, and — if diagnosed early — sometimes antibiotics can be used for treatment ( 3 ).
If you’ve eaten blue cheese while pregnant, don’t panic. Monitor any symptoms and contact a health professional if you suspect you have listeriosis.

The bottom line
Blue cheese is a soft,  mold-ripened cheese  that many people enjoy on salads and in sauces.
It’s often made with unpasteurized milk, which puts it at high risk of causing listeriosis, a potentially dangerous infection for pregnant women.
Thus, pregnant women should avoid most blue cheese, as well as products that contain it.
Still, a few blue cheeses are made with pasteurized milk, and these are safe to consume.
If you have eaten unpasteurized blue cheese while pregnant, the best course of action is to monitor your symptoms and call your healthcare provider if you’re concerned.
