Eating low carb can be an adjustment and may limit your options for dining out or ordering in. Here are some ways to make low carb meal prep easy:
Plan your meals for the week.  Planning your meals in advance makes it easier to shop for groceries and to stick to your diet when things get busy or hectic.
Prep certain foods up front.  Likewise, prep as much as possible in advance. For instance, you can chop veggies, brown ground beef, and make  dressings  or marinades in advance. You can also prep all your meals for work during the weekend prior.
Keep plenty of low carb ingredients on hand.  This way, you can throw together a quick low carb meal. For instance, if you have frozen shrimp,  shirataki noodles , and a jar of Alfredo sauce, you can make a low carb shrimp Alfredo any time.
Some foods contain hidden carbs that may sabotage your low carb diet.
In particular, many  condiments  are loaded with sugar, even though they may not taste particularly sweet. You may want to avoid or limit the following:
ketchup
honey mustard
barbecue sauce
balsamic vinegar  and  balsamic vinaigrette
teriyaki sauce
hoisin sauce
sweet and sour sauce
fruit salsas  such as mango or peach salsa

Easy low carb breakfast recipes
This dish makes a great breakfast that you can enjoy every day. It’s rich in protein and vegetables to help keep you full for a long time.
1/2 tablespoon (30 mL) coconut oil
roughly 1 cup (70–150 grams) fresh or frozen vegetables of your choice (I like sliced  mushrooms )
2 eggs, beaten
salt and pepper
Add  coconut oil  to a skillet and turn the heat to medium.
Add vegetables and cook until mostly done or crisp on the bottom. If you use frozen veggies, they’ll need a few extra minutes.
Add eggs, salt, and pepper. Stir continuously so that the eggs  scramble  and don’t burn.
As soon as the eggs have set completely, remove the pan from heat and serve the eggs.
varies based on the veggies you include
Although bacon is highly processed and may not be appropriate for your everyday breakfast, it’s an excellent treat every once in a while.
2 slices  bacon
2  eggs
salt and pepper
Add bacon to a skillet and  fry  over medium heat until it reaches the crispness level you like.
Transfer bacon to a plate and crack both eggs into the pan, then add salt and  pepper . Cook the eggs in the bacon fat.
If you like runny yolks, don’t break the yolks. Instead, flip the eggs when the whites on the bottom have set, then remove them once the entire white has set. If you prefer the yolks fully cooked, it’s easiest to break them.
roughly 1 gram of carbs for two slices of  bacon  and two  eggs
Overnight oats are easy and flavorful but loaded with carbs. One alternative is chia pudding, which is much lower in carbs. Tiny, fiber-rich chia seeds absorb liquid and swell overnight to form a jelly-like texture.
2 tablespoons (24 grams) chia seeds
3/4 cup (180 mL) unsweetened milk of your choice
liquid  stevia drops  (or your preferred sweetener)
berries for topping (strawberries and  raspberries  are low in carbs)
In a lidded Mason jar, combine  chia seeds , milk, and liquid stevia drops. Put the lid on the jar and refrigerate overnight.
The next morning, top with  berries  and enjoy.
depends on the type of milk and berries used
roughly 10 grams of carbs and 9 grams of fiber per 2 tablespoons (24 grams) of  chia seeds

Easy low carb lunch recipes
It doesn’t get much easier than a bunless burger that you can dress however you’d like.

salt , pepper, and Worcestershire sauce

Add hamburger patty and season with salt, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce.
After a few minutes, flip the patty and season the other side. Cook fully, or until the juices run clear.
Dress the burger with your favorite low carb toppings and serve with a  side salad  to make it a complete meal.
A plain, cooked  hamburger patty  has 0 grams of carbs
Toppings and sides may add carbs

1/2 cup (48 grams) almond flour
1/2 cup (45 grams) grated  Parmesan cheese
