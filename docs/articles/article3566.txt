Title: The 10 Best Keto Smoothie Recipes

The ketogenic diet involves dramatically decreasing your intake of carbs and instead getting most of your calories from fat.
It can help children with epilepsy manage their seizures, and has also been linked to weight loss, better blood sugar control, and lower cholesterol levels ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
Since the keto diet limits carbs, smoothies that contain high-carb ingredients like fruits, yogurt, honey, and milk don’t usually fit into this style of eating. This can be an issue for those who rely on smoothies for a quick and healthy breakfast or snack.
Fortunately, there are still smoothies with low-carb and nutritious ingredients that you can enjoy while following the keto diet.
Here are the 10 best keto smoothie recipes that are low in carbs and high in fat.

1. Triple berry avocado breakfast smoothie
Berries, including strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries, are lower in carbs than most other fruits. They’re also rich in fiber, an indigestible carb that promotes digestive health ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ).
Since fiber doesn’t get broken down in your body, those who follow the keto diet often subtract the grams of fiber from the total grams of carbs to estimate how many  net carbs  are in a particular food ( 7 ,  8 ).
Berries are low in net carbs and thus suitable in small portions for the keto diet.
This triple berry keto smoothie has 9 grams of net carbs and is filling enough for breakfast or a snack. To make one serving, blend the following ingredients:
1 cup (240 ml) of water
1/2 cup (98 grams) of frozen  mixed berries  (strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries)
half of an avocado (100 grams)
2 cups (40 grams) of spinach
2 tablespoons (20 grams) of hemp seeds
