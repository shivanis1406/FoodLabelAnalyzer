Title: EGCG (Epigallocatechin Gallate): Benefits, Dosage, and Safety

Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a unique plant compound that may help to reduce inflammation, aid weight loss, and prevent conditions like heart disease.
Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a type of plant-based compound called catechins, which are a type of polyphenol. EGCG exists naturally in several plant-based foods but is also available as a dietary supplement, usually sold as an extract.
EGCG and other catechins have antioxidant effects that may protect against cellular damage caused by free radicals.
Free radicals are highly reactive particles formed in your body that can damage your cells when their numbers get too high. Eating foods high in antioxidants like catechins may help limit free radical damage.
Some  research  suggests EGCG’s properties may offer certain health benefits, like helping to lower high blood pressure and promoting weight loss. But, research is ongoing to learn the extent of these benefits and the risk of adverse side effects.
Keep reading to learn more about the benefits, sources, and potential side effects of EGCG.

What foods contain EGCG?
EGCG may be best known for its role as the major active compound in  green tea . In fact, researchers  typically credit  the numerous health benefits associated with  drinking green tea  to its EGCG content.
Though EGCG is abundant in green tea, it also exists in small amounts in other foods. According to a  2020 review , you can find catechins like EGCG in the following:
teas
cocoa products
pome fruits, like  apples  and  pears
prune juice
While a lot of research  focuses  on EGCG, as the most potent catechin in green tea, other types like epicatechin, epigallocatechin, and epicatechin 3-gallate may offer similar benefits. Plus, many of them are more widely available in the food supply.
Red wine , broad beans, and most fruit are a few examples of dietary sources that  contain  health-promoting catechins.

What are the health benefits of EGCG?
Test-tube, animal, and some human studies suggest that EGCG provides health benefits. For example, research in a  2020 article  suggests that catechins like EGCG may help to reduce  inflammation  and prevent certain chronic conditions, including:
high blood pressure
diabetes
some  cancers
Ultimately, more research is necessary to better understand how people can use EGCG as a preventive tool or treatment for disease, though current data is promising.
Much of EGCG’s claim to fame  comes from  its strong antioxidant capacity and potential to combat  oxidative stress  and inflammation.
Oxidative stress  occurs when  there are too many free radicals in your body.
Research  links  oxidative stress and inflammation to various chronic conditions, including cancer, diabetes, and heart disease.
EGCG’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties  may protect  your cells from damage due to oxidative stress and suppress the activity of pro-inflammatory chemicals, such as TNF-alpha.
Research in a  2022 review  suggests that EGCG may support heart health by reducing blood pressure, cholesterol, and the accumulation of plaque in blood vessels — all  major risk factors  for heart disease.
A  2022 animal study  found that EGCG lowered blood pressure in hypertensive mice over 14 days.
Research in a  2020 systematic review  of 3,321 people across 31 trials concluded that green tea typically helps to lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
A  2023 review  also highlights research suggesting that drinking more green tea may lower the risk of death from heart diseases.
Though these results are encouraging, more research is necessary to better understand how EGCG in green tea may reduce heart disease risk.
EGCG may also promote  weight loss . According to a  2021 systematic review , people experienced significant reductions in body mass index and waist circumference when taking green tea over 12 weeks.
The authors concluded that using green tea along with dietary adjustments and regular exercise may be beneficial for weight management in people with obesity.
Additional human studies in a  2017 systematic review  have collectively found that taking 100 to 460 milligrams (mg) of EGCG daily with 80 to 300 mg of  caffeine  for at least 12 weeks may lead to significant weight loss and reduction of body fat.
Still, more research is necessary to understand EGCG’s effects on weight loss.
Animal studies in a  2022 review  suggest EGCG may have the following effects:
improve brain function
prevent degenerative brain diseases
help with nerve cell regeneration
In a  2018 review , multiple observational studies in humans found a link between a higher intake of green tea and a reduced risk of age-related brain decline, as well as  Alzheimer’s disease  and  Parkinson’s disease . However, the available data is inconsistent.
According to a  2019 review , human, animal, and cell culture studies support green tea catechins’ potential neuroprotective qualities.
However, more research is necessary to understand if and how ECGC may effectively prevent and treat degenerative brain diseases in humans.

EGCG dosage
Various studies use different dosages when testing EGCG’s health effects.
A  2018 systematic review  suggests that a 240 milliliter (ml) serving of green tea may provide around 187 mg of EGCG. However, catechin levels may vary widely depending on the product and preparation.
Green tea and the EGCG it contains are common in Chinese traditional Medicine. One  2019 article  suggests EGCG may be safe in doses as high as 3 grams (g) per day.
However,  some reports suggest  that very high doses of EGCG may lead to liver toxicity in animals and humans. Higher doses  may be more easily achievable  when people consume green tea extract or EGCG supplements.
Most information on EGCG toxicity comes from animal studies. More clinical studies are necessary to understand safe dosages and toxicity levels in humans.

Possible side effects of EGCG
It’s important to note that EGCG is not 100% safe or risk-free. In fact, some research  associates  EGCG supplements with serious side effects, such as:
liver and kidney failure
dizziness
low blood sugar
anemia
EGCG can interfere with the metabolism of  folate  — a B vitamin essential for fetal growth and development. So, you should not take EGCG supplements if you are pregnant.
It remains unclear if EGCG supplements are safe for people who are breastfeeding, so it’s likely best to avoid it until more research is available.
EGCG may also interfere with the absorption of some prescription medications, including certain types of antipsychotic and  cholesterol-lowering  medications.
To ensure safety, always speak with your healthcare professional before starting a new dietary supplement.

The bottom line
EGCG is a powerful compound that may benefit health by reducing inflammation, aiding weight loss, and preventing certain chronic diseases.
It’s most abundant in green tea but also found in other plant foods.
When taken as a supplement, EGCG may lead to certain side effects, such as dizziness or liver failure. The safest route is to consult with a healthcare professional before adding EGCG to your routine to ensure this supplement is right for you.
