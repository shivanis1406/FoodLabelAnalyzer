Title: The 9 Best Nondairy Substitutes for Milk

You can find many great milk alternatives available, including these 9 options. Make sure to stick with unsweetened varieties and avoid added sugars. Also check that your nondairy milk is fortified with calcium and vitamin B12.
Cow’s milk is considered a staple in many people’s diets. It is consumed as a beverage, poured on cereal and added to smoothies, tea or coffee.
While it is a popular choice for many, some people can’t or choose not to drink milk due to personal preferences, dietary restrictions, allergies or intolerances.
Fortunately, if you’re looking to avoid cow’s milk, there are plenty of nondairy alternatives available. This article lists nine of the best substitutes for cow’s milk.

Why You Might Want a Substitute
Cow’s milk boasts an impressive nutrient profile. It’s rich in high-quality protein and important vitamins and minerals, including calcium, phosphorus and B vitamins.
In fact, 1 cup (240 ml) of whole milk provides 146 calories, 8 grams of fat, 8 grams of protein and 13 grams of carbohydrates ( 1 ).
However, cow’s milk is not a suitable option for everyone. There are several reasons you might be looking for an alternative, including:
Milk allergy:  2–3% of kids  under the age of three are allergic to cow’s milk. This can cause a range  of symptoms, including rashes, vomiting, diarrhea and severe anaphylaxis.  Around 80% of kids outgrow this allergy by age 16 ( 2 ,  3 ).
Lactose intolerance:  An estimated  75% of the world’s population is  intolerant to lactose,  the sugar found in  milk. This condition happens when people have a deficiency in lactase, the  enzyme that digests lactose ( 4 ).
Dietary restrictions:  Some people  choose to exclude animal products from their diets for ethical or health  reasons. For example, vegans exclude all products that come from animals,  including cow’s milk.
Potential health  risks:  Some people choose to avoid cow’s milk due to concerns over potential  contaminants, including antibiotics, pesticides and hormones ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
The good news is that there are many nondairy options available if you want or need to avoid cow’s milk. Read on for a few great recommendations.

1. Soy Milk
Soy milk is made with either soybeans or soy protein isolate, and often contains thickeners and vegetable oils to improve taste and consistency.
It typically has a mild and creamy flavor. However, the taste can vary between brands. It works best as a substitute for cow’s milk in savory dishes, with coffee or on top of cereal.
One cup (240 ml) of unsweetened soy milk contains 80–90 calories, 4–4.5 grams of fat, 7–9 grams of protein and 4 grams of carbohydrates ( 8 ,  9 ).
In terms of nutrition, soy milk is a close nondairy substitute for cow’s milk. It contains a similar amount of protein, but around half the number of calories, fats and carbohydrates.
It is also one of the few plant-based sources of high-quality “complete” protein, which provides all the essential amino acids. These are the amino acids that cannot be produced by the body and must be obtained from the diet ( 10 ).
On the other hand,  soy  has become one of the world’s most controversial foods, and people are often concerned over its effects in the body.
This is mostly because of the large amounts of isoflavones in soy. These can affect estrogen receptors in the body and affect the function of hormones ( 11 ,  12 ).
While this topic is widely debated, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that moderate amounts of soy or soy milk will cause harm in otherwise healthy adults ( 13 ,  14 ,  15 ).
Lastly, soy milk made from soybeans is not recommended for people with a FODMAP intolerance or who are in the elimination phase of the low-FODMAP diet.
FODMAPs are a type of short-chain carbohydrate naturally present in some foods. They can cause digestive issues such as gas and bloating.
However, soy milk made from soy protein isolate can be consumed as an alternative.
Summary  Soy milk is made from  whole soybeans or soy protein isolate. It has a creamy, mild taste and is the  most similar in nutrition to cow’s milk. Soy milk is often seen as  controversial, though drinking soy milk in moderation is unlikely to cause  harm.

2. Almond Milk
Almond milk is made with either whole almonds or almond butter and water.
It has a light texture and a slightly sweet and nutty flavor. It can be added to coffee and tea, mixed in smoothies and used as a substitute for cow’s milk in desserts and baked goods.
One cup (240 ml) of unsweetened  almond milk  contains 30–35 calories, 2.5 grams of fat, 1 gram of protein and 1–2 grams of carbohydrates ( 16 ,  17 ).
Compared to cow’s milk, it contains less than a quarter of the calories and less than half the fat. It is also significantly lower in protein and carbohydrates.
It is one of the lowest-calorie nondairy milks available and is a great option for those wanting or needing to lower the number of calories they’re consuming.
What’s more, almond milk is a natural source of vitamin E, a group of antioxidants that help protect the body from disease-causing substances known as free radicals.
On the other hand, almond milk is a much less concentrated source of the beneficial nutrients found in whole almonds, including protein, fiber and healthy fats.
This is because almond milk is made up of mostly water. In fact, many brands contain only 2% almonds. These are often blanched with the skin removed, which greatly reduces the fiber, protein, vitamin and mineral content.
To make the most of the nutrients and health benefits of almonds, choose brands of almond milk that contain a higher content of almonds, around 7–15%.
Almonds also contain phytic acid, a substance that binds to iron, zinc and calcium to reduce their absorption in the body. This may somewhat decrease your body’s absorption of these nutrients from almond milk ( 18 ,  19 ).
Summary  Almond milk has a light, sweet, nutty flavor and is low in  calories, fat and carbohydrates. On the downside, it is low in protein and  contains phytic acid, a substance that limits the absorption of iron, zinc and  calcium.

3. Coconut Milk
Coconut milk is made from water and the white flesh of brown coconuts.
It is sold in cartons alongside milk and is a more diluted version of the type of coconut milk commonly used in Southeast Asian and Indian cuisines, which is usually sold in cans.
Coconut milk  has a creamy texture and a sweet but subtle coconut flavor. One cup (240 ml) contains 45 calories, 4 grams of fat, no protein and almost no carbohydrates ( 20 ,  21 ).
Coconut milk contains one-third the calories of cow’s milk, half the fat and significantly less protein and carbohydrates.
In fact, coconut milk has the lowest protein and carbohydrate content of the nondairy milks. It may not be the best option for those with increased protein requirements, but it would suit those looking to reduce their carb intake.
What’s more, around 90% of the calories from coconut milk come from saturated fat, including a type of saturated fat known as  medium-chain triglycerides  (MCTs).
Some research suggests that MCTs may help reduce appetite, assist with weight loss and improve blood cholesterol levels more than other fats ( 22 ,  23 ,  24 ,  25 ).
On the other hand, a recent review of 21 studies found that coconut oil may raise levels of total and “bad” low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to a greater extent than unsaturated oils ( 26 ).
However, much of this research is based on poor-quality evidence and there is very little research on the effects of coconut milk specifically. At the end of the day, consuming a moderate amount of coconut milk as part of a healthy diet should not be a cause for concern.
Lastly, it is recommended that people with a FODMAP intolerance, or those who are completing the elimination phase of the FODMAP diet, limit coconut milk to a 1/2-cup (120-ml) portion at a time.
Summary  Coconut milk has a  creamy, milk-like consistency and a sweet, coconut taste. It contains no  protein, little to no carbohydrates and is high in medium-chain triglycerides  (MCTs), a type of saturated fat.

4. Oat Milk
In its simplest form, oat milk is made from a mixture of oats and water. Nevertheless, manufacturers often add extra ingredients such as  gums , oils and salt to produce a desirable taste and texture.
Oat milk is naturally sweet and mild in flavor. It can be used in cooking in the same way as cow’s milk, and tastes great with cereal or in smoothies.
One cup (240 ml) contains 140–170 calories, 4.5–5 grams of fat, 2.5–5 grams of protein and 19–29 grams of carbohydrates ( 27 ,  28 ).
Oat milk contains a similar number of calories to cow’s milk, up to double the number of carbohydrates and about half the amount of protein and fat.
Interestingly, oat milk is high in total fiber and beta-glucan, a type of soluble fiber that forms a thick gel as it passes through the gut.
The beta-glucan gel binds to cholesterol, reducing its absorption in the body. This helps lower cholesterol levels, particularly LDL cholesterol, the type associated with an increased risk of heart disease ( 29 ,  30 ,  31 ).
One study in men with high cholesterol found that consuming 25 ounces (750 ml) of  oat  milk daily for five weeks lowered total cholesterol by 3% and LDL cholesterol by 5% ( 32 ).
What’s more, research has shown that beta-glucan may help increase feelings of fullness and lower blood sugar levels after a meal ( 33 ,  34 ,  35 ).
Oat milk is also cheap and easy to make at home.
Summary  Oat milk has a mild,  sweet flavor. It is high in protein and fiber, but also high in calories and  carbohydrates. Oat milk contains beta-glucan, which can help lower cholesterol  and blood sugar levels.

5. Rice Milk
Rice milk is made from milled white or brown rice and water. As with other nondairy milks, it often contains thickeners to improve texture and taste.
Rice milk is the least allergenic of the nondairy milks. This makes it a safe option for those with  allergies  or intolerances to dairy, gluten, soy or nuts.
Rice milk is mild in taste and naturally sweet in flavor. It has a slightly watery consistency and is great to drink on its own as well as in smoothies, in desserts and with oatmeal.
One cup (240 ml) of rice milk contains 130–140 calories, 2–3 grams of fat, 1 gram of protein and 27–38 grams of carbohydrates (36,  37 ).
Rice milk contains a similar number of calories to cow’s milk, but almost double the carbohydrates. It also contains considerably less protein and fat.
Of all the nondairy milk alternatives on this list, rice milk contains the most carbohydrates — around three times as many as the others.
What’s more, rice milk has a high glycemic index (GI) of 79–92, which means it is absorbed quickly in the gut and rapidly raises blood sugar levels. For this reason, it may not be the best option for people with diabetes.
Due to its low protein content, rice milk may also not be the best option for growing children, athletes and the elderly. This is because these populations have higher protein requirements.
Rice milk has also been shown to contain high levels of inorganic  arsenic , a toxic chemical found naturally in the environment ( 38 ).
Long-term exposure to high levels of inorganic arsenic has been associated with an increased risk of various health problems, including certain cancers and heart disease ( 39 ,  40 ,  41 ).
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that people consume rice as part of a balanced diet that includes a variety of grains. Solely relying on rice and rice products is not advised, especially for infants, toddlers and pregnant women ( 42 ).
For most people, drinking rice milk should not be a cause for concern. However, if rice happens to make up a significant part of your diet, then it could be beneficial to diversify your diet by eating a variety of grains, including other nondairy milks.
Summary  Rice milk is the most hypoallergenic nondairy  milk. It is low in fat and protein yet high in carbohydrates. Rice milk  contains high levels of inorganic arsenic, which may cause some potential  health problems in those who consume rice as a main food source.

6. Cashew Milk
Cashew milk is made from a mixture of cashew nuts or cashew butter and water.
It is rich and creamy and has a sweet and subtle nutty flavor. It’s great for thickening smoothies, as a creamer in coffee and as a substitute for cow’s milk in desserts.
As with most nut-based milks, the nut pulp is strained from the milk. This means the fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals from the whole cashew are lost.
One cup (240 ml) of unsweetened cashew milk contains just 25–50 calories, 2–4 grams of fat, 0–1 gram of protein and 1–2 grams of carbohydrates ( 43 ,  44 ).
Cashew milk contains fewer than one third of the calories of cow’s milk, half the fat and significantly less protein and carbohydrates.
Due to its low protein content, cashew milk may not be the best option for people with increased protein requirements.
It could be worth switching to a higher-protein milk such as soy or oat if you have increased protein needs, or if you struggle to meet your daily protein requirements.
However, with only 25–50 calories per cup (240 ml), unsweetened cashew milk is a great, low-calorie option for those looking to  reduce their total daily calorie intake .
The low carbohydrate and sugar content also makes it a suitable option for people who need to monitor their carb intakes, such as people with diabetes.
Lastly, cashew milk is one of the easiest milks to make at home.
Summary  Cashew milk has a rich and creamy taste and is  low in calories, carbohydrates and sugar. On the downside, it contains very  little protein, and may not be the best option for those with higher protein  requirements.

7. Macadamia Milk
Macadamia milk is made mostly of water and about 3% macadamia nuts. It’s fairly new to the market, and most brands are made in Australia using Australian macadamias.
It has a richer, smoother and creamier flavor than most nondairy milks, and tastes great on its own or in coffee and smoothies.
One cup (240 ml) contains 50–55 calories, 4.5–5 grams of fat, 1–5 grams of protein and 1 gram of carbohydrates ( 45 ,  46 ).
Macadamia milk contains one third the calories and about half the fat of cow’s milk. It is also somewhat lower in protein and carbohydrates.
It is very low in calories, with only 50–55 calories per cup (240 ml). This makes it a great option for those trying to reduce their calorie intake.
The low carbohydrate content also makes it a suitable option for people with diabetes or those looking to reduce their carb intake.
What’s more, macadamia milk is a great source of healthy  monounsaturated fats , with 3.8 grams per cup (240 ml).
Increasing your intake of monounsaturated fats may help reduce blood cholesterol levels, blood pressure and the risk of heart disease, especially if it replaces some saturated fat or carbohydrates in your diet ( 47 ,  48 ,  49 ,  50 ).
Summary  Macadamia milk is a relatively new milk to the market. It’s made  from macadamia nuts and has a rich, creamy taste. Macadamia milk is high in  monounsaturated fats and low in calories and carbohydrates.

8. Hemp Milk
Hemp milk is made from the seeds of the  hemp  plant,  Cannabis sativa . This is the same species used to make the drug cannabis, also known as marijuana.
Unlike marijuana, hemp seeds contain only trace amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the chemical responsible for marijuana’s mind-altering effects ( 51 ).
Hemp milk has a slightly sweet, nutty taste and a thin, watery texture. It works best as a substitute for lighter milks such as skim milk.
One cup (240 ml) of unsweetened hemp milk contains 60–80 calories, 4.5–8 grams of fat, 2–3 grams of protein and 0–1 gram of carbohydrates ( 52 ,  53 ).
Hemp milk contains a similar amount of fat to cow’s milk, but around half the calories and protein. It also contains significantly fewer carbohydrates.
It is a good option for vegans and vegetarians, since one glass provides 2–3 grams of high quality, complete protein, with all the essential amino acids.
What’s more, hemp milk is a source of two essential fatty acids: the omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid and the omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid. Your body cannot make omega-3s and omega-6s, so you must obtain them from foods ( 54 ).
Lastly, unsweetened hemp milk is very low in carbohydrates, making it a great option for those who want to reduce their carb intake. If this is a priority for you, avoid sweetened varieties because they can contain up to 20 grams of carbs per cup (240 ml) ( 55 ).
Summary  Hemp milk has a thin, watery texture and a  sweet and nutty flavor. It is low in calories and contains little to no carbs.  Hemp milk is a great option for vegetarians and vegans because it is a source  of high-quality protein and two essential fatty acids.

9. Quinoa Milk
Quinoa milk is made from water and quinoa, an edible seed that is commonly prepared and consumed as a grain.
The whole  quinoa  grain is very nutritious, gluten-free and rich in high-quality protein.
While quinoa has become a very popular “superfood” over recent years, quinoa milk is fairly new to the market.
For this reason, it is slightly more expensive than other nondairy milks and can be a little harder to find on supermarket shelves.
Quinoa milk is slightly sweet and nutty and has a distinct quinoa flavor. It works best poured onto cereal and in warm porridge.
One cup (240 ml) contains 70 calories, 1 gram of fat, 2 grams of protein and 12 grams of carbohydrates ( 56 ).
Quinoa milk contains a similar number of carbohydrates to cow’s milk, but fewer than half the calories. It also contains significantly less fat and protein.
It is made up of mostly water and contains 5–10% quinoa. This means that most of the protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals from quinoa are diluted.
It has a fairly well-balanced nutrition profile compared to other nondairy milks. It is comparatively low in fat with moderate amounts of protein, calories and carbs.
Quinoa milk is a good plant-based source of complete protein for vegetarians and vegans. If it is available at your local supermarket, then it could be worth trying.
Summary  Quinoa milk has a distinct flavor and is  slightly sweet and nutty. It contains a moderate number of calories, protein  and carbs compared to other nondairy milks. It’s a good option for vegetarians  and vegans since it contains high-quality protein.

What to Consider When Substituting
With a wide range of nondairy milks available on supermarket shelves, it can be difficult to know which one is best for you.
Here are a few important things to consider:
Added sugar:  Sugar is often  added to enhance flavor and texture. Stick with unsweetened varieties over  flavored ones, and try to avoid brands that list sugar as one of the first  three ingredients.
Calcium content:  Cow’s milk is  rich in calcium, which is vital for healthy bones and preventing osteoporosis.  Most nondairy milks are fortified with it, so choose one that contains at  least 120 mg of calcium per 3.4 ounces (100 ml).
Vitamin B12:  Vitamin B12 is  naturally found in animal products and is essential for a healthy brain  and immune system. People who limit or avoid animal products from their  diets should choose milk that is fortified with B12.
Cost:  Nondairy milks  are often more expensive than cow’s milk. To cut costs, try making  plant-based milk at home. However, one downside of making your own milk is  that it will not be fortified with calcium and vitamin B12.
Additives:  Some nondairy  milks may contain additives such as carrageenan and vegetable gums to  achieve a thick and smooth texture. While these additives aren’t  necessarily unhealthy, some people prefer to avoid them.
Dietary needs:  Some people have  allergies or intolerances to certain ingredients used in plant-based  milks, such as gluten, nuts and soy. Be sure to check labels if you have  an allergy or intolerance.
Summary  There are a few things to  consider when choosing a cow’s milk alternative, including nutrient content,  added sugars and additives. Reading food labels will help you understand what’s  in the milk you are buying.

The Bottom Line
For many people, cow’s milk is a dietary staple.
However, there are a number of reasons you may need or choose to forgo cow’s milk, including allergies, ethical reasons and concerns over potential health risks.
Fortunately, there are many great alternatives available, including the nine in this list.
When making your choice, be sure to stick with unsweetened varieties and avoid added sugars. In addition, make sure your nondairy milk is fortified with calcium and vitamin B12.
There is no one milk that’s ideal for everyone. The taste, nutrition and cost of these alternatives can vary considerably, so it might take a while to find the one that’s best for you.
