Title: Does Matcha Contain Caffeine?

Matcha is a powdered green tea from the plant camellia sinensis. It typically contains more caffeine than other types of green tea. But too much caffeine may also have harmful effects.
Matcha is a powdered green tea from the plant  Camellia sinensis  and is mainly grown in Japan.
Due to the way it’s grown, matcha is very high in antioxidants — compounds that protect against cell damage in the body that may lead to disease ( 1 ,  2 ).
The caffeine content of matcha also tends to be higher than other varieties of green tea.
This article reviews how much caffeine is in matcha and how to make it.

What is caffeine?
Caffeine  is a substance naturally found in tea, coffee, and chocolate and acts as a stimulant in the body.
The stimulant properties of caffeine mean that it triggers activity in the central nervous system that translates to feeling energized and alert ( 3 ).
Many people drink beverages with caffeine, like matcha, to boost energy and focus.
Regular caffeine intake may also help reduce the risk of several diseases, such as the risk of stroke, heart disease, and some cancers. However, too much caffeine may also have harmful effects ( 4 ).
While there is no standardized recommendation for  caffeine intake , most experts suggest that adults should not consume more than 400 mg of caffeine per day to avoid potentially negative health effects ( 5 ).
But the amount of caffeine that’s tolerable and beneficial depends on the person. Keep that in mind when incorporating matcha into your diet.
Caffeine is a natural stimulant that helps boost energy levels and alertness. It is found in matcha and other teas, coffee, and chocolate.

How much caffeine is in matcha?
The caffeine content of matcha can vary based on the type of leaves, how much powder you use to make the tea, and brewing time ( 2 ,  6 ).
Generally, matcha contains 19–44 mg of caffeine per gram. A typical serving of matcha is between 2–4 grams (1/2–1 teaspoon), which would then contain anywhere between 38–176 mg of caffeine ( 2 ).
For reference, coffee beans have 10–12 mg of caffeine per gram. An 8-ounce (240 mL) cup containing 10 grams of coffee has roughly 100 mg of caffeine ( 2 ).
So, depending on how concentrated the  matcha tea  is, a serving of matcha tea could have a lower or higher caffeine content than a serving of coffee.
Matcha contains 19–44 mg of caffeine per gram or about 38-176 mg of caffeine per cup. The caffeine in a typical serving of matcha depends on how much powder is used, how fresh it is, and how it’s brewed.

Caffeine in matcha vs. regular green tea
Matcha is higher in caffeine than regular green tea.
One cup (240 mL) of green tea is estimated to contain about 30 mg of caffeine. A serving of matcha made with 2–4 grams (1/2–1 teaspoon) of powder could have a caffeine content between 38–176 mg of caffeine ( 2 ,  7 ).
However, studies suggest that the caffeine content of  green tea  varies depending on the type, freshness, and brewing time ( 8 ).
One study found that caffeine in green tea ranged from 10–23 mg of caffeine per gram of tea leaves or 20–90 mg of caffeine per cup ( 8 ).
With 19–44 mg of caffeine per gram, matcha is higher in caffeine than most regular green teas ( 2 ).
Matcha contains more caffeine per gram and in a typical serving than most green teas. A typical cup of matcha contains 38–176 mg of caffeine, while a regular cup of green tea may contain 20–90 mg of caffeine.

How to make matcha
To make a cup of matcha tea, you need matcha powder, a mug or cup, hot water, and a bamboo matcha whisk (chasen) or regular whisk. You may also want to use a small mesh sieve or tea strainer.
Once you have your tools, follow these steps:
Spoon 2-4 grams (1/2-1 teaspoon) matcha powder into a tea strainer or small mesh sieve over a mug or cup. Sift the matcha to prevent clumping.
Pour a small amount of hot water on top of the powder. Whisk the powder in the water until it gets foamy on top.
Add the rest of the hot water.
Enjoy!
You can make matcha at home by whisking matcha powder with hot water.

The bottom line
Matcha tea is a type of green tea that contains caffeine.
It is higher in caffeine than most regular green teas and may contain  more caffeine than coffee , depending on how much powder you use. However, matcha’s caffeine also varies depending on type, freshness, and brewing time.
You can drink matcha tea for a caffeine boost. It’s easy to make at home, or you can find it at some coffee shops and cafes.
