Title: Maca Root for Curves: Booty-Booster or Bust?

Maca is an ingredient that has been extensively studied for its potent health-promoting properties.
It’s also a common supplement used to boost libido, mood, and energy levels.
Additionally, many people claim that maca root can help improve body composition and enhance curviness — despite limited evidence.
This article reviews whether maca root can be used to become curvier.

What is maca?
Maca, also known as Peruvian ginseng or  Lepidium meyenii , is an edible plant that is native to Peru.
Classified as a cruciferous vegetable and closely related to plants like  broccoli , kale, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower, it has been well studied for its powerful medicinal properties.
The root of the plant is usually dried and ground into a fine powder, which can be added to smoothies, baked goods, and  snacks .
Maca is also available in liquid or capsule form and taken as a supplement to support better health.
In particular, it has been shown to improve sexual function, male fertility, and mood ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).

Can maca help you become curvier?
Currently, no research supports the use of maca root for getting curves.
Nevertheless, it offers some benefits that could help you in this regard when paired with other diet and lifestyle modifications.
Here are a few of the ways that maca may help you become curvier.
Exercise is a key component when it comes to  building muscle  and getting curves.
Some research suggests that maca may boost physical performance and enhance your exercise routine, which could promote curviness.
For example, a small study in 8 people found that supplementing with maca extract for 14 days improved cycling time compared with a placebo ( 4 ).
Similarly, one study showed that administering maca extract to mice for 3 weeks improved endurance and increased the amount of time to exhaustion in a swimming test by up to 41% ( 5 ).
In addition to improving endurance and stamina, maca may  boost your energy levels  to give your workout routine an upgrade.
A 12-week study in 175 people found that taking 3 grams of maca daily led to significant improvements in both mood and energy levels ( 6 ).
A study in mice also showed that maca extract helped fight fatigue during a swimming test ( 7 ).
Another study even observed that concentrated maca extract relieved  fatigue  in mice by decreasing several markers of muscle damage during exercise ( 8 ).
The above studies demonstrate that maca may help enhance physical performance and fight off fatigue.
This may increase muscle-building, which can help you become curvier.
However, maca alone is unlikely to have any effect on your  body composition  or curviness unless it’s paired with regular exercise.
Therefore, it’s important to combine your maca supplement with a healthy diet and fitness routine to maximize its possible benefits.
Maca may boost physical performance and energy levels, which could help you get curvier when paired with regular exercise.

Other benefits of maca
Maca has been linked to a number of health benefits, including:
Improves sexual function.  One review of four studies found that maca may increase sexual desire in both men and women when used for at least six weeks ( 1 ).
Supports male fertility.  Several studies show that maca may increase several markers of  fertility in men , including semen quality and sperm concentration and motility ( 2 ,  9 ).
Decreases anxiety and depression.  A small study in 14 postmenopausal women noted that taking 3.5 grams of maca per day for 6 weeks reduced psychological symptoms like  anxiety  and depression ( 10 ).
Enhances memory.  Though research in humans is limited, multiple studies in mice indicate that maca may improve learning and memory ( 11 ,  12 ,  13 ).
Maca may improve sexual function, male fertility, and memory. It may also reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression.

How to use maca
Maca can be found at a variety of  online retailers , natural pharmacies, and health food shops.
Available in powder, liquid, or capsule form, it’s very easy to add to your diet.
Maca root has an earthy, slightly nutty taste and can be included in many recipes. Try adding it to smoothies or mixing it into hot beverages for a quick and convenient way to get your fix.
You can also incorporate it into your favorite baked goods or sprinkle it over  oatmeal  or  yogurt  for an added dose of nutrition and health benefits.
Though there’s no official recommended dosage, most studies indicate that 3–5 grams per day are most effective.
Maca is generally considered safe and can be consumed with minimal risk of adverse effects ( 6 ).
However, those with thyroid issues should exercise caution when using maca, as it contains  goitrogens , which are compounds that could disrupt the production of thyroid hormones in those with thyroid conditions ( 14 ).
Additionally, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should talk to their healthcare practitioner before taking maca, as evidence to support its safety in these populations is insufficient.
Maca is available in powder, liquid, or capsule form and can be added to many foods and drinks. Though it’s generally safe, those with thyroid issues and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should exercise caution.

The bottom line
Maca is a powerful ingredient that has been linked to various potential  health benefits .
Though research to support its use for becoming curvier is lacking, maca root has been shown to increase energy levels and physical performance, which could promote muscle-building and curviness.
Still, it should be paired with  regular exercise  and a nutritious diet to maximize its potential effects.
