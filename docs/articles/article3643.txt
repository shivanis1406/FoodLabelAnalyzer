Title: Is Eating One Meal a Day a Safe and Effective Way to Lose Weight?

Eating one meal a day is a type of intermittent fasting that restricts calorie consumption during a certain window of time. It may support weight loss and provide other health benefits.
Eating one meal a day is a practice that many people swear by to lose weight and improve overall health. The one-meal-per-day diet is also referred to as OMAD.
Although the content and timing of the meal will vary based on personal preference, people following an OMAD diet typically restrict their  calorie  intake to a single meal or a short window of time.
The potential health benefits of OMAD are primarily related to  fasting  — restricting calorie intake during a set time period — and calorie restriction in general.

How it works
There are many types of intermittent fasting practices and multiple ways to implement OMAD.
Examples include having just one meal and fasting for the rest of the day or having one meal and eating limited amounts of food during fasting periods.
This type of diet creates a calorie deficit, which can lead to weight loss.
Other health benefits related to fasting include the potential to reduce  heart disease  risk factors, decrease  blood sugar , and reduce  inflammation .
However, compared to other fasting regimens, such as the  16/8 method , which involves 8-hour eating windows and 16-hour fasting windows, eating just one meal per day is one of the most extreme methods of intermittent fasting.
A few popular diets encourage eating one meal per day. For example, when following the  Warrior Diet , a person eats a single meal a day, cycling between long periods of fasting with short periods of energy consumption.
Most people following OMAD choose to only consume dinner, although others choose breakfast or lunch as their one meal. Some versions of this eating pattern allow a snack or two in addition to the one meal.
However, some OMAD enthusiasts don’t consume anything containing calories during their fasting window and only consume calories during their chosen meal, which typically lasts an hour or so.

Weight loss
To lose weight, you must create an energy deficit.
You can do this by either increasing the number of calories you burn or reducing your calorie intake. Calorie restriction, no matter how you achieve it, will lead to fat loss.
People using the OMAD method are likely to lose weight simply because they’re taking in fewer overall calories than they typically would during a regular pattern of eating.
For example, a  2022 study  involving healthy adults with a lean body frame showed that restricting calorie intake to a 2-hour time period in the evening (5 p.m. to 7 p.m.) led to significantly greater body fat and total body weight loss than when eating three separate meals throughout the day.
A  2018 research review  also indicated that intermittent fasting, including extended fasting periods like OMAD, is likely to lead to weight loss.
However, it doesn’t seem to be any more effective than traditional methods of calorie restriction, such as reducing calorie intake at each meal.
A  2017 data review  involved gathering meal intake information from 50,660 adult Seventh-day Adventist Church members ages 30 years and older living in the United States and Canada. The research showed that those who consumed 1 or 2 meals per day had a yearly reduction in body mass index (BMI) compared to those who consumed 3 meals per day.
It also showed that an overnight fast of 18 hours or more was associated with decreased body weight compared to shorter fasting windows.
However, these weight loss benefits are related to intermittent fasting in general, not just the OMAD.
Plus, extreme methods of fasting, such as OMAD, may lead to loss of lean body mass as well.
This eating method may not be ideal for maintaining or building muscle mass. Loss of lean body mass is associated with an increased risk of metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or dyslipidemia.

Benefits
In addition to weight loss,  research  has linked fasting to other health benefits. For example, fasting may help  reduce blood sugar  and certain heart disease risk factors, including  LDL “bad” cholesterol .
Fasting has also been  associated with  reducing markers of inflammation, including  C-reactive protein .
Additionally, fasting may offer unique benefits that support a healthy nervous system. According to  animal research , it may slow neurodegeneration and promote longevity.
However, although these potential benefits are promising, it’s important to note that these benefits are associated with fasting in general and not OMAD specifically.
In fact,  some research  shows that the OMAD pattern may more adversely affect health than other, less restrictive fasting methods.

Downsides
Although research has associated fasting and calorie restriction with a variety of health benefits, some evidence suggests that too much calorie restriction — which can include only consuming one meal a day — may do more harm than good.
For example,  an older study  suggests that this extreme restriction may lead to increased total and LDL “bad” cholesterol and higher blood pressure levels compared to typical eating patterns or less extreme fasting methods.
Another older study  involved middle-age healthy men and women who were of moderate weight and asked to eat meals at scheduled intervals but not restrict their calories. The research suggests that eating one meal per day may increase fasting blood sugar levels, delay the body’s response to  insulin , and increase levels of the appetite-stimulating hormone  ghrelin  compared to eating three meals per day.
This eating method may lead to extreme hunger.
What’s more, restricting calories to one meal a day may increase the chances of  hypoglycemia , or low blood sugar, especially in those with  type 2 diabetes .
In addition to these potential adverse effects, eating one meal a day can lead to symptoms, including:
nausea
dizziness
irritability
low energy
constipation
The OMAD diet is also not appropriate for many groups of people, including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, children and teens, older adults, and people with  eating disorders .
Lastly, some people following the OMAD dietary pattern may likely overly consume highly processed, calorie-dense foods like fast food, pizza, doughnuts, and ice cream during their one meal.
While these foods can fit into a balanced lifestyle, exclusively eating foods high in added sugar and other low nutrient ingredients will negatively affect your health in the long run.
Overall, although there are benefits related to fasting and calorie restriction,  research  suggests that consuming two or three meals per day is likely a better option for overall health than eating one meal a day.
A  2022 study  found eating one meal a day was associated with an increased risk of death from any cause as well as death from cardiovascular disease.

Foods to eat and avoid
No matter the type of dietary pattern you choose, your intake should mostly consist of whole, nutrient-dense foods.
Although most health professionals would not recommend eating only one meal a day, if you do choose this eating pattern, it’s essential to ensure that you’re consuming a  variety of nutritious foods , including:
fruits,  such as berries,  citrus fruits , and bananas
vegetables,  such as kale, broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, and peppers
starchy vegetables and grains,  such as sweet potatoes, butternut squash, oats, quinoa, and barley
healthful fats,  such as avocados,  olive oil , and unsweetened coconut
legumes,  such as peas, chickpeas, lentils, and black beans
seeds, nuts, and nut butters,  such as cashews, macadamia nuts, almonds, and pumpkin seeds
dairy and plant-based alternative products,  unsweetened yogurt, coconut milk, and cashew milk
protein sources,  such as chicken, fish,  tofu , and eggs
Limit highly processed foods, such as:
fast food
sugary baked goods
white bread
sugary cereals
soda
chips
These foods offer little nutritional value, and eating them too often  can lead to  weight gain and increased disease risk.
During fasting windows, the OMAD diet requires people to keep calorie intake to a minimum.
In the strict OMAD diet, this means complete restriction of calories. You can still enjoy water and other noncaloric beverages during fasting periods.
Others choose to eat low calorie, high protein snacks during the day, such as:
egg whites
chicken
tuna
Again, most healthcare professionals do not recommend eating just one meal a day, as it can have severely negative effects on overall health.
If you’re considering trying this dietary pattern, consult a trusted healthcare professional for advice before you start.

Sample menu
Eating one meal a day is unlikely to give you the calories and nutrients your body needs to thrive unless carefully planned. Choosing to eat within a longer time period may help you increase your nutrient intake.
If you do choose to try out eating one meal a day, you probably should not do it 7 days a week and it’s important to discuss your plan with a healthcare professional.
Most people follow the OMAD pattern a few days a week, cycling it in with a normal dietary pattern or a less restrictive intermittent fasting regimen like the 16/8 method.
If eating one meal a day, try to make meals as nutrient-dense as possible. These meals should deliver at least 1,200 calories, which can be difficult for some to ingest over a typical meal window.
If you find it challenging to eat enough calories in one meal, consider increasing your eating window by an hour or so and splitting your meal into two smaller meals. This can help you get enough nutrients and calories without becoming overly full.
Here are some nutritionally complete meal ideas that are likely to exceed 1,200 calories if portion sizes are large enough:
Baked chicken with mashed sweet potatoes topped with butter and roasted broccoli with olive oil, followed by full fat Greek yogurt topped with berries, nuts, seeds, and  honey .
Grilled salmon topped with guacamole,  brown rice  and black bean salad, and roasted plantains, followed by fruit served with nut butter,  hemp seeds , and coconut flakes.
Egg omelet with goat cheese, avocado, and grilled vegetables cooked in coconut oil, crispy baked potato wedges, followed by a side of fruit dipped in  dark chocolate  and whipped cream.
As you can see, each meal should account for all food groups and include:
carbohydrates
fats
proteins
In a day, eating 1,200 calories is a general minimum. Most adults need much more than that to maintain their weight.
Keep in mind that this way of eating is much more difficult for those following specific dietary patterns like  vegan diets  or  low fat diets  due to the number of calories that must fit into a single meal.
Overall, trying to cram all your calorie needs into one meal is not necessary no matter what your health goal is. This dietary pattern is also not sustainable or practical for most people.

Frequently asked questions
Eating one meal a day may be a popular way to lose weight, but it’s likely not a good idea for overall health.
Limiting intake to one meal per day can also lead to disordered eating tendencies, affect a person’s social life, and be extremely difficult for most people to stick to.
What’s more, it can be very difficult to take in enough nutrients in one meal. This can lead to  nutrient deficiencies , which can negatively affect your health and can lead to serious risks.
If you are eating only one meal a day, you may find yourself overeating during your one meal if you are not mindful of your food intake.
It’s important that your one meal is particularly balanced. With an increase in hunger, the temptation to overly eat highly processed, high carb foods may be harder to resist, leading to a net increase in calories, especially if you are not staying physically active.
This is a type of OMAD diet in which your one meal per day is restricted to a single hour and you eat nothing for the remainder of the day.

Bottom line
Although fasting in general — including prolonged fasting — may benefit health in a number of ways, people can reach the same health benefits using much more sustainable methods.
More sustainable eating plans include 16/8 intermittent fasting or simply following a healthful, lower calorie dietary plan if you’re currently eating in a surplus and want to promote weight loss.
Most healthcare professionals advise against OMAD dietary patterns due to their extreme nature.
People can encourage better overall health through more sustainable methods.
