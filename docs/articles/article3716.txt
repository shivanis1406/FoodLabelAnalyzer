Title: 11 Proven Benefits of Olive Oil

Olive oil may offer several health benefits, such as antioxidants, healthy fats, and anti-inflammatory properties, among others.
The health effects of dietary fat are controversial.
However, experts agree that olive oil — especially extra virgin — is good for you.
Here are 11 health benefits of olive oil that are supported by scientific research.

1. Olive oil is rich in healthy monounsaturated fats
Olive oil is the natural oil extracted from olives, the fruit of the olive tree.
About  13.8%  of the oil is  saturated fat , whereas 10.5% is polyunsaturated, such as  omega-6 and omega-3  fatty acids.
However, olive oil’s predominant fatty acid is oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat that makes up 71% of the total oil content.
Studies suggest that oleic acid  reduces  inflammation and oxidative stress, and may even have beneficial effects on genes  linked to  cancer.
Monounsaturated fats  are also quite  resistant  to high heat, making extra virgin olive oil a  healthy choice for cooking .

2. Olive oil contains large amounts of antioxidants
Extra virgin olive oil  contains modest amounts of vitamins.
For example, 1 tablespoon (tbsp) contains  13%  of the Daily Value (DV) for  vitamin E  and 7% of the DV for  vitamin K .
But olive oil is also loaded with powerful  antioxidants  that are  biologically active . These may help reduce your risk of chronic diseases that affect your cardiovascular and central nervous system.
Antioxidants also  fight  inflammation and help protect blood cholesterol from oxidation — two benefits that may lower your risk of heart disease.

3. Olive oil has strong anti-inflammatory properties
Chronic inflammation  is thought to be a leading driver of diseases,  such as :
cancer
heart disease
metabolic syndrome
type 2 diabetes
Alzheimer’s disease
arthritis
obesity
Extra-virgin olive oil may help reduce inflammation, which may be one of the main reasons for its health benefits.
The antioxidants mediate the main anti-inflammatory effects. Key among them is oleocanthal, which has been shown to  work similarly  to  ibuprofen , a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.
Research also suggests that oleic acid, the main fatty acid in olive oil, can  reduce levels  of certain inflammatory markers, such as  C-reactive protein (CRP) .

4. Olive oil may help prevent strokes
A  stroke  is  caused  by a disturbance of blood flow to your brain, either due to a blood clot or bleeding.
It’s the second most common cause of death, according to the  World Health Organization (WHO) .
The relationship between olive oil and stroke risk has been studied extensively, but the results are mixed.
For example, a  2014 review  of studies on 841,000 people found that olive oil was the only source of monounsaturated fat associated with a reduced risk of stroke and heart disease.
However, a  2020 meta-analysis  found no significant link between olive oil intake and stroke risk.
If you think you may be at risk of stroke, speak with a healthcare professional. They could recommend dietary and lifestyle changes for you.

5. Olive oil is protective against heart disease
Heart disease  is the most common cause of death in the world, according to the  WHO .
Observational studies conducted a  few decades ago  showed that heart disease is less common in Mediterranean countries.
This led to extensive research on the  Mediterranean diet , which has now been  shown to  significantly reduce heart disease risk.
Extra virgin olive oil is one of the key ingredients in this diet, but the research on its benefits for heart disease is mixed.
For example, a  2018 review  suggests it may help lower inflammation and increase  HDL (good) cholesterol . The authors note it may also lower other blood lipids, but not as much as other plant oils.
On the other hand, a  2022 meta-analysis  found that each additional 10 grams of olive oil consumed daily had minimal effects on blood lipids.
Olive oil has also been shown to  lower  blood pressure, which is one of the strongest risk factors for heart disease and premature death.
If you have heart disease, a family history of heart disease, or any other risk factor, you may want to consider including extra virgin olive oil in your diet.

6. Olive oil is not associated with weight gain and obesity
Eating excessive amounts of calories may lead to  weight gain , and fats are high in calories.
However,  numerous studies  have linked the Mediterranean diet, rich in olive oil, with favorable effects on body weight.
A  2018 review  also found that diets high in olive oil helped promote weight loss more than diets low in olive oil.
However, it’s important to note that consuming excessive amounts of any food could lead to weight gain, and olive oil is no exception.
If you’re unsure about how much olive oil to consume, speak with a registered dietitian. They could provide dietary recommendations specific to you.

7. Olive oil may fight Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease  is one of the  most common  neurodegenerative conditions in the world.
One of its key features is the buildup of  beta-amyloid plaques  inside your brain cells, which may lead to a decline in cognition and memory loss.
A  2024 review  found that olive oil may reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive impairment. It may do this by reducing beta-amyloid plaques, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress.
Keep in mind more research is needed to fully determine the impact of olive oil on Alzheimer’s disease.

8. Olive oil may reduce type 2 diabetes risk
Olive oil may help protect against  type 2 diabetes .
A 2019 study found that people with prediabetes who took 55 mL of oleanolic acid-enriched olive oil each day were  55%  less likely to develop diabetes than participants in the control group.
A  2017 meta-analysis  also found that olive oil supplementation significantly helped reduce blood sugar levels and fasting plasma glucose in people with type 2 diabetes.

9. The antioxidants in olive oil have anticancer properties
Cancer  is one of the most common causes of death in the world, according to the  WHO .
People in Mediterranean countries have a lower risk of some cancers.  Experts  believe the Mediterranean diet — which includes olive oil — may be the reason.
A large 2022 meta-analysis found that people who consumed the highest amount of olive oil were  31%  less likely to develop cancer.
This may be due to the antioxidants in olive oil, which may  help reduce  oxidative damage caused by free radicals, a leading driver of cancer.
Despite the positive outlook, more research is needed to determine the exact role of olive oil on cancer.

10. Olive oil can help treat rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis  is an autoimmune disease  characterized  by deformed and painful joints.
Although the exact cause is not well understood, it involves your immune system attacking healthy cells by mistake.
A  2023 study  found that olive oil was linked with lower inflammatory markers and disease severity in people with rheumatoid arthritis, especially for more severe disease activity.
The researchers also found that olive oil helped decrease CRP levels, which may play a role in inflammation and disease progression.
However, limited research supports the effect of olive oil on rheumatoid arthritis.
A healthcare professional may recommend other  natural remedies  as part of your treatment plan.

11. Olive oil has antibacterial properties
Olive oil contains  compounds  that may inhibit or kill harmful bacteria.
One of these is  Helicobacter pylori  (H. pylori), a bacterium that lives in your stomach and may  cause  stomach ulcers and stomach cancer.
A  2022 animal study  found that extra virgin olive oil may help fight against certain strains of this bacterium.
That said, more research on humans is needed to support olive oil’s role in fighting bacteria and infections. There are other, better-studied ways of treating H. pylori.

Make sure to get extra virgin olive oil
Buying extra virgin olive oil may provide more health benefits than refined olive oil.
Extra virgin olive oil retains some of the antioxidants and bioactive compounds from the olives, whereas refined olive oil loses much of the olive’s nutrients.
It’s also important to carefully read the labels and  ingredient lists  before buying a product. Many oils that read “extra virgin” on the label have  been diluted  with other refined oils.
Look for the seal of approval from the  North American Olive Oil Association .

Frequently asked questions
