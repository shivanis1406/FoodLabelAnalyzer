Title: Best Foods and Drinks for a Hangover

There is no magic food for a hangover cure. Hangover research is limited, but certain foods and drinks, like bananas, pickles, or coffee, may be able to help your symptoms.
A hangover is your body’s reaction to drinking too much alcohol.
Symptoms include fatigue, nausea, headache, sensitivity to light, dehydration, or dizziness that lasts several hours.
Research on hangovers is limited, and the exact processes behind them are poorly understood.
It’s thought that the body experiences specific hormonal and immune responses during a hangover that trigger different symptoms.
While there is no known cure for hangovers, several foods and drinks may alleviate symptoms.

Fruit and vegetables
Many fruits and vegetables are rich in nutrients and natural sugars. These healthful foods may help reduce hangover symptoms.
Alcohol blocks the production of a hormone that helps your body hold on to water,  leading to  dehydration and the loss of electrolytes like potassium and sodium.
Bananas  are especially  rich in potassium  and can help replenish your body’s stores. One medium banana  contains 9%  of the daily value (DV) for potassium.
Eating watermelon  may help pr event headaches associated with hangovers, which are usually due to dehydration and decreased blood flow to the brain.
Watermelon is rich in L-citrulline, a nutrient that  may increase  blood flow. What’s more, its high water content can help you rehydrate.
Blueberries  are rich in nutrients that  fight inflammation  in the body, which is handy if you have a hangover.
A  2003 study  of 20 men found that blood levels of various inflammatory compounds increased after alcohol consumption. Thus, eating blueberries after having too much to drink may help fight related inflammation.
Oranges are  rich in vitamin C , which may prevent your body from losing glutathione.
Glutathione is an antioxidant that helps rid your body of alcohol and  decreases  inflammation during alcohol consumption.
Eating oranges may provide the vitamin C needed to keep glutathione levels stable and reduce hangover symptoms.
Pickles are high in sodium, an electrolyte that  excessive drinking  depletes. Eating pickles or drinking their brine may help boost your sodium levels and overcome your hangover.
One dill pickle spear contains  about 12%  of the DV for sodium. Even better, 2 ounces (60 ml) of pickle juice provides  about 16%  of the DV. Keep in mind that the sodium content of pickles may vary by brand.
Sweet potatoes contain several nutrients that may help you get over a hangover faster.
One cup (200 grams) of cooked sweet potato  contains  over 200% of the DV for vitamin A, 13% for magnesium, and 20% for potassium.
Vitamin A  may  help fight  the inflammation associated with hangovers, while magnesium and potassium  are needed  to replace what’s lost during alcohol consumption.
Spinach is rich in folate, a nutrient that diminishes due to heavy drinking.
Alcohol impairs folate absorption, and chronic alcohol intake can lead to deficiency.
Eating spinach can help you maintain adequate  folate  levels after drinking alcohol. One cup (180 grams) of cooked spinach  provides 66%  of the DV.
Eating avocados after a night of heavy drinking can help raise low potassium levels from alcohol consumption and dehydration.
In fact, one  avocado  (136 grams)  contains 15%  of the DV for this mineral.
Older  research shows  that avocados contain compounds that protect against liver injury. Since drinking in excess takes a toll on your liver, avocados may be especially beneficial for hangovers.
Asparagus  packs certain compounds that may provide hangover relief.
According to one  2009 test-tube study , asparagus extract more than doubled the effectiveness of certain enzymes that help break down alcohol and protect liver cells from damage.
Though there is currently no research on the effect of asparagus on hangovers in humans, eating this vegetable may be worth a try.

Meat and fish
The protein and healthful fats in many meat and fish products may help with a hangover.
Meat and other  high protein foods  may help your body better handle a hangover.
Research shows  that alcohol prevents your body from absorbing certain amino acids. In fact, chronic alcohol consumption  can lead  to amino acid deficiencies.
Your body breaks down protein into amino acids, making it a good choice during a hangover.
Three ounces (85 grams) of beef have close to  22 grams  of protein, while three ounces (85 grams) of chicken breast pack  24 grams .
Chicken noodle soup is a popular remedy for the flu or common cold. However, it may also be helpful for hangovers.
Older  research shows  that chicken noodle soup can help you rehydrate — mostly due to its high sodium content.
One cup (240 grams) of chicken noodle soup  provides 32%  of the DV for sodium.
Salmon is rich in  omega-3 fatty acids  that are excellent at  decreasing  inflammation in your body.
Since drinking alcohol  can increase  the number of compounds that cause inflammation, eating salmon or other fatty fish may be a good way to ease hangover symptoms.
Eggs  are rich in cysteine, an amino acid that your body  uses to  produce the antioxidant glutathione.
Drinking alcohol  decreases  the body’s stores of glutathione. Without it, your body has difficulty breaking down the toxic byproducts of alcohol metabolism.
Eating cysteine-rich eggs is a great way to increase glutathione in your body and possibly improve hangover symptoms.

Other foods
Below are some other foods that may help with a hangover.
Oatmeal  contains complex carbohydrates that provide a slow and steady release of sugar into the bloodstream. This may help with hangover symptoms.
One  2003 study  found that eating a breakfast full of complex carbs instead of refined sugars improved mood and reduced feelings of fatigue.
However, the study participants were healthy men who hadn’t been consuming alcohol, so it’s unclear whether results would be the same in people experiencing hangover symptoms.
Still, it’s possible that reaching for oatmeal after a night of heavy drinking could help with hangover-related fatigue or low blood sugar.
Extensive  research supports  the use of  ginger  as an effective remedy for nausea.
The anti-nausea effects of ginger make it a possible treatment for the stomach upset associated with hangovers.
Because of its high fructose content,  honey  may improve hangover symptoms.  Depending on  the type , it can be between 21% and 43% fructo se.
While research on this subject is limited, fructose  may help  the body rid itself of alcohol more quickly. One  2005 study  of 50 adults found that honey increased the rate of alcohol elimination by up to 32.4%.
Crackers contain fast-acting carbs that can increase your blood sugar during a hangover and improve related symptoms.
When the liver processes alcohol, it no longer focuses on regulating blood sugar. This is why low blood sugar can result from excessive drinking, especially in people with diabetes. Eating carbs  increases  blood sugar.
Five saltine crackers (15 grams) contain  approximately  11 grams of  carbs .
Due to their high magnesium content,  nuts  may be a solution to your hangover.
Excessive alcohol consumption can deplete magnesium in your cells. As a result, refilling magnesium stores  may help  treat symptoms.
One ounce (28 grams) of almonds provides  close to 20%  of the DV for magnesium.

Drinks
The drinks below may help reduce hangover symptoms.
Drinking water  is one of the most important things you can do with a hangover.
Since alcohol is a diuretic, it makes you pee more frequently and increases water loss. Water can replenish these lost fluids.
Tomato juice may be another good beverage to drink with a hangover.
Older research shows that tomatoes  contain  compounds that protect against liver injury. Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to liver damage, so tomatoes could theoretically  help reduce  the effects of drinking alcohol.
Green tea  may help fight hangovers, too.
One  2014 study  found that compounds in green tea significantly decreased blood alcohol concentration in rats. Additional research shows similar effects in mice fed  green tea extracts .
While researchers have only assessed these effects in animals, the effectiveness of green tea in improving hangover symptoms may translate to humans.
Since hydration is such an important part of hangover recovery, drinking  coconut water  may facilitate getting over a hangover.
Coconut water contains lots of electrolytes. One cup (240 ml) of coconut water has  11% and 13%  of the DVs for sodium and potassium, respectively.
Research  has shown  that coconut water is just as effective for rehydration as traditional sports drinks.
Some  studies link  coffee consumption to decreased inflammation, but the  research  is mixed. Therefore, drinking a cup of joe after a night of heavy drinking may or may not fight inflammation from a hangover.
However,  coffee  can be a good choice if you’re looking to  improve  your hangover fatigue and become more alert.

The bottom line
While there is no magical cure for a hangover, several foods and drinks may help you feel better. The best way to prevent a hangover is to avoid alcohol altogether or to drink it in moderation.
