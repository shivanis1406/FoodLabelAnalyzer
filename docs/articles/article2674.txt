Meanwhile, all subscriptions include a free 20-minute consultation with a registered dietitian, and monthly coaching packages are available for an additional fee.
“Factor’s menu includes a wide range of protein types and vegetables. Although I wish it featured a larger variety of cuisine, the meals still had great flavors and textures after reheating,” said McGrane.

Best for singles
Meal type   prepared meals
Menus   Smoothies, Soups, Noodle Bowls, Grain Bowls
Price per serving   $9.99 to $13.49
Why we like it:  Splendid Spoon’s  plant-based meal delivery service  offers a wide selection of prepared offerings — including soups, noodle bowls, entrees, and smoothies — compatible with a healthy meal plan. You can also try the service without a subscription by ordering from the Splendid Spoon Marketplace.
Unlike many other meal delivery services, Splendid Spoon doesn’t have separate meal plans to choose from. But you can filter by meal type, dietary needs, ingredients you want to avoid, nutritional benefits, and taste and texture, such as spicy or sweet. This makes it easy to find the healthy meal options that best fit your needs and preferences.
Although the meal kits are not designed to be low in carbs or fat, nutritional information is available for each item. Many of the meals contain fewer than 400 calories, so they may leave you feeling hungry.
Soups and noodle bowls are flash frozen for freshness, which helps maximize their shelf life. Smoothies and entrees called Dishes are refrigerated and shipped in recyclable insulation to ensure that they arrive fresh.
The taste of the meals won over our tester.
“I found Splendid Spoon to be a more nutritious and flavorful alternative to buying  frozen meals  from the grocery store,” McGrane said. “I found all of the ingredients in my meals to be flavorful and fresh-tasting, even after reheating, and none of the ingredients became soggy or mushy — a win for  prepared meal delivery .”
Regarding the smoothies, McGrane observed a variation in texture, with some being creamy and others having an overly watery consistency.
“The flavors, though, were good and not too sweet,” she added, and she opted to add oat milk to some smoothies to make them creamier.
She also noted that most items fit easily into the fridge and freezer, but the bowls and soups can be a bit bulky to store.

“I enjoyed the taste of all the Purple Carrot meals I tried, and their unique ingredient combinations stood out from other meal delivery kits,” said McGrane.
“Purple Carrot is a great option for people who follow a  plant-based diet  and those looking for a variety of creative, flavorful recipes to try.”

Meal type   prepared meals and a la carte items
Why we like it:  With its extensive menu of frozen, fully prepared meals, Trifecta Nutrition provides healthy meals that can especially help support your  training  and fitness goals.
Several of its meal plans include well-balanced meals with organic produce and sustainably sourced seafood or grass-fed meats. Trifecta’s rotating menus include breakfast, lunch, and dinner entrees, and you can also order protein, veggies, and carbs a la carte.
Healthline writer  Rachael Ajmera , MS, RD, found Trifecta meals to be “nutritionally balanced, filling, and delicious.”
She did note that following the recommendation to heat the prepared meals on the stovetop retained ingredient texture better than heating them in the microwave.

Why we like it:  With a rotating menu of more than 35 prepared meals to choose from each week — created by local and regional chefs — Territory Foods has a robust selection of nutritious offerings that support both  keto  and paleo diets.
All meals are free of gluten, dairy, and refined sugar, and the company uses responsibly sourced, local ingredients, including proteins that are naturally raised, without hormones or antibiotics, to ensure that you receive a healthy meal.
“I didn’t expect to like this [service] as much as I did,” said Healthline Senior Editor Candice Abellon.
“The variety of meals is good [with] chicken, beef, and fish options as well as plant-based proteins. Meals included those that had less or no grains, and there were filters for low carb and keto to make them easier to find.
“The serving size was [also] good for me — there was just a little more than I could eat in one sitting.”

Why we like it:  Epicured offers a wide range of nutritious, prepared meals, including entrees, salads, soups, side dishes, and snacks, all of which are gluten-free and low in FODMAPs — carbohydrates that  can cause  digestive issues for some people.
“I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of cuisine, protein, and vegetable types offered. I prefer to eat mostly vegetarian, with one to two meat dishes per week, and I found it very easy to find options that fit those preferences,” said McGrane. “I also like that there was a good variety of types of meals, including sandwiches, rice dishes, soups, salads, etc.”
Still, McGrane said she wished that Epicurious’ sign-up process and subscription menu selection were both a bit clearer and more streamlined and that shipping wasn’t so expensive.
“Overall, while choosing items is easy, the other processes are a bit clunky.”

Best Korean
Meal type   meal kits
Menus   weekly rotating menu of 12 meals
Price per serving   $11.95 to $14.95

Why we love it:  DooFood brings the flavors of Korea to your doorstep and makes cooking a breeze by doing all the prep work for you. It’s not a subscription service, meaning you can place orders whenever you’d like. There’s no need to worry about recurring payments or pausing and canceling subscriptions.

Meal kits arrive with everything you need, pre-chopped and ready to go. According to the website, you just need to have salt, pepper, and olive oil on hand, and DooFood handles the rest. Most meals are ready within 15 minutes.

Nutrition and allergen information are available on the website for each recipe. However, keep in mind that even if a recipe does not include an allergen, it’s processed in the same facility, so DooFood may not be suitable for people with severe food allergies.

According to the website, the company also prioritizes eco-friendly packaging, claiming that it creates 50% less waste than leading meal kit services.

DooFood ships out twice per week. It requires orders of $60 minimum.

Other healthy meal delivery choices
While they didn’t ultimately make our list for best healthy  meal delivery , the following services also offer a good variety of healthy meal options:
The Good Kitchen  (3.6 out of 5):  The Good Kitchen offers nutritious meals, but our tester felt they could have been better seasoned.
Snap Kitchen  (3.6 out of 5):  Snap Kitchen has a pretty extensive menu and is more affordable than many similar services. However, the portion size may be too small for some, and our tester felt some of the meals could use more veggies.
Sprinly  (3.6 out of 5):  Sprinly is a tasty plant-based option, but it’s very pricey.
Daily Harvest  (3.6 out of 5):  While Daily Harvest offers organic, plant-based smoothies and light meals, our tester found that it wasn’t as filling as options from other meal delivery services.
Halal Meal Prep  (3.4 out of 5):  Halal Meal Prep is a prepared meal kit option. Our tester Jamie and her husband liked the variety of dishes available, but microwaving the dishes required some guesswork, and only some of the meals delivered on flavor.

Comparison of healthy meal delivery services

How we chose the best healthy meal delivery services
At Healthline, we know that meal delivery services aren’t a small investment, so we’ve taken the time to test more than 30 of the most popular meal delivery services on the market. Testers select a week’s worth of meals from multiple menus to get a well-rounded view of the types of flavors and ingredients offered.
During testing, we consider several factors, including the ease of the signup and meal selection process, the variety and nutritional composition of the meals offered, ingredient quality and freshness, how easy the meals are to cook, and, of course, the taste.
We also aim to include meal delivery services suitable for a wide range of dietary needs and preferences, with options available at many different price points.
You can learn more about  our testing process .
Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate menus and ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the meal delivery services on this page, we considered all the services that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further.  Read more about how we test meal delivery services.

What to look for in healthy food delivery services
Before you start any new diet or meal plan, talk with a medical professional or  registered dietitian  to learn how a  change in your diet  might affect your health.
This is especially important if you have any conditions that may be helped or harmed by a change in diet, including:
heart disease
high cholesterol
diabetes
celiac disease
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
food allergies
Changing your diet can have a significant effect on your nutrition and vitamin intake. A doctor or dietitian can help you monitor for any  nutritional deficiencies  that might arise as you adjust to your new diet. They may perform regular  blood tests  to measure levels of vitamins such as:
vitamin A
folate
iron
zinc
If you already follow a special diet for health or personal reasons — such as a  vegetarian ,  vegan , or  pescatarian  diet — keep a close eye on the ingredients in a meal delivery service to make sure you don’t sign up for food you can’t eat.
Some meal delivery services may also not be compatible with diets that you might follow for religious reasons, such as  kosher  or  halal  diets. Check out each meal delivery service’s options and review any options they may offer if you observe any religious dietary restrictions.
If this information is not clear on the website, you can contact the company directly through the website’s chat option, email, or phone number.
Be careful to check for the overuse of ingredients with low nutrient value or preservatives that can  increase your risk of disease . Meal delivery services can especially cause you to eat more  processed meats , such as bacon, sausage, and lunch meats — even in seemingly healthy meals like soups or salads.
If the meal delivery service you use offers the option of choosing meals, pick meals that include different  lean proteins  and veggie options to promote  nutritional variety  in the diet.

Frozen prepared meals aren’t always healthy. That’s because they tend to use a lot of sauces or gravies that contain high amounts of sodium and saturated fats to help keep the meals moist and deliver on flavor.
But if it uses mostly nutritious ingredients, a frozen prepared meal can be healthy — even when compared with a fresh meal that might be high in saturated fats or sodium.

Healthy food delivery can be fresh or frozen, though fresh food is often considered healthier than frozen food.
But it depends on what foods you’re eating. Frozen meats or foods high in saturated fats and sodium definitely aren’t as healthy as frozen fruits and vegetables.
And eating frozen fruits and vegetables is better than not eating them at all. They can sometimes even be safer to eat because they’re less likely than  raw produce  to carry foodborne illness.

The healthiest meals for weight loss are those that are high in lean proteins, fiber, and healthy fats — they’re good for you and help you stay full longer so that you don’t overeat.
Some foods to consider to  support weight loss  are eggs, leafy greens, fish, and cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and cabbage.
