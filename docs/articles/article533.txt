Title: The Different Stages of Losing Weight: Fat Loss vs. Weight Loss

While weight loss can include reduced weight from stored carbs, protein, water, and fat, fat loss includes only weight loss from fat. Fat loss typically occurs at a slower rate.
If you’re like most people, you may be eager to know when you can expect to see results after embarking on your weight loss journey.
At the same time, you may want to know whether the weight you’re losing is coming from fat rather than muscle or water.
This article reviews the stages of weight loss, the difference between weight loss and  fat loss , and tips for preventing weight regain.

What are the stages of losing weight?
Weight loss  generally occurs in two stages — an early,  rapid weight loss  stage  followed  by a slower, longer period of weight loss.
In some cases, weight loss may plateau. This is when it may become challenging to prevent weight regain.
The first stage of weight loss is when you tend to lose the most weight and begin to notice changes in your appearance and how your clothes fit. It usually happens within the first  few weeks .
In the beginning, your weight loss will be mostly due to water loss. For example, if you’re  following a low carb diet , it will result in less water being stored in your body and a net loss of water. How you’ll lose weight after that depends on your specific diet plan.
Weight loss tends to happen  more rapidly  in people who follow a low carb diet than in those who follow  a low fat diet , as those on a low carb diet deplete their body’s carb stores faster, along with water.
But in the long term, the  research remains mixed  on whether a  low carb or keto diet  offers an advantage for overall weight loss over a low fat diet.
Factors other than diet, including your age, sex, starting weight, and  physical activity level , can also influence your rate of weight loss.
For example, men  are likely  to lose weight more quickly than women and older adults  may lose weight  more quickly than younger adults.
Additionally, you’re likely to lose weight more quickly if you have a higher starting weight and exercise more often.
In the second stage (usually after the first few weeks), weight loss  occurs  at a much slower rate and will usually be due mostly to fat loss.
At times, you may experience a  weight loss plateau  during which you lose little to no weight.
Weight loss plateaus can occur  due to  metabolic adaptations that decrease your  metabolism  and the  number of calories you burn  while exercising.
However, weight loss  plateaus  more commonly happen because some diets  may be  overly restrictive and hard to follow, causing people to deviate from them.
It’s important to follow a dietary pattern that fits your lifestyle and preferences so that you can stick with it long-term.
In either case, you’ll likely need to adjust your diet and lifestyle over time to reach your goal.

Fat loss vs. weight loss
While the terms  “weight loss” and “fat loss”  are often used interchangeably, they have different meanings.
Weight loss is a decrease in overall  body weight  from stored carbs, protein, water, and fat, while fat loss is  weight loss only from fat .
Fat loss is a healthier goal than weight loss since weight loss  may include  water and muscle loss.
Maintaining muscle  is important for  supporting  healthy  blood sugar levels , managing inflammation, and maintaining your mobility as you age.
While a standard scale can’t differentiate between weight loss and fat loss, you can increase the likelihood of fat loss by  eating plenty of protein  and creating a  calorie deficit  by engaging in  more physical activity  and reducing your  overall calorie intake .

Weight loss maintenance strategies
The evidence to support dieting for  sustainable weight loss  is far from convincing.
A 2018 review cited an older review of 29 studies, which found that participants who lost weight through dieting regained more than half the weight they lost within 2 years, and by 5 years, they had regained more than  80%  of the weight they lost.
However, these statistics shouldn’t prevent you from focusing on your diet and  losing weight  to improve your health or self-image.
Besides, diets are only effective if they allow you to develop sustainable, healthy behaviors.
Here are some dietary and lifestyle tips that  may help  prevent  weight regain :
Engage in self-monitoring behaviors such as tracking your diet and exercise:  Tracking your calorie intake and exercise increases your awareness of your behaviors and how they affect your  weight loss goals .
Find physical activities you enjoy:  Exercise can come in many forms, such as biking, walking, swimming, taking the stairs, and playing outdoors with your kids. Find an activity you enjoy and do it often.
Try to keep healthy foods, such as fruits and vegetables, available at home:  If you have more  nutritious foods  at home instead of highly processed snacks like chips and soda, the decision to eat healthily is already made for you.
Prioritize sleep and try to reduce stress however possible:  A  lack of sleep  and many of life’s stressors can sabotage your weight loss goals. Work on establishing healthy sleep habits and try to learn ways to ease your worry about things you can’t control.
Fill your plate with whole foods:  Choose  whole, minimally processed foods  such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats whenever possible. These foods can help keep you feeling full and provide your body with the necessary nutrients to support weight loss and your health.

Frequently asked questions
The second weight loss stage is likely to be harder because your weight loss will be slower. This is also the stage where many people hit a weight loss plateau.
Where you lose fat first depends on many factors, such as your genetics, sex, and age. While the  research is conflicting , experts mostly agree that you cannot target a specific body part to lose weight through exercise.
However, some  research  suggests that men typically lose weight in their abdominal area, while women tend to see more weight loss in their hips.
Women in postmenopause and men in middle age, in particular, tend to gain weight around their abdomen, which suggests they may see weight loss in this area at first.

When you’re exercising, your body  breaks down  stored fat, known as triacylglycerol, via a process called  lipolysis . This causes the release of free fatty acids (FFAs) into your bloodstream, which are transported to your tissues for energy.
As your muscles use more energy and need increased blood flow, the FFAs enter the mitochondria of your muscle cells and are burned off. The shrinking of fat cells occurs over time when their contents are released and used for energy by your muscle cells.

The bottom line
You tend to lose the most weight and notice the most significant physical changes during the first weight loss stage.
During the second stage of weight loss, you lose weight more slowly, but the weight you lose comes primarily from fat rather than stored carbs, protein, and water.
The most important factor in weight loss is adopting  sustainable and healthy dietary and exercise habits  that you can maintain in the long term.
