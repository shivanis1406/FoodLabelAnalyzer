Title: Which Grains Are Low in Carbs? 9 Good Choices

High fiber grains, including quinoa and oats, can reduce the number of carbohydrates your body absorbs. They can also provide other key nutrients. Read on for more good options.
Grains are often completely off-limits on many low carb diets.
However, several types of grains are high in fiber. This means you can enjoy them in moderation as part of a healthy, carb-controlled diet.
Foods that are high in fiber contain a lower number of net carbs, which is the number of carbs the body absorbs. You can calculate net carbs by subtracting the grams of fiber from the total grams of carbs.
Here are some of the top grains that are low in carbs, plus a few others that you may want to limit on a low carb diet.

1. Oats
Oats  are highly nutritious. They are a great source of many important nutrients, including fiber.
A cup of  cooked oats  contains around 4 grams of dietary  fiber  and around 23 grams of net carbs.
Oats are also rich in beta-glucan. This is a type of fiber that  research  has shown to reduce levels of LDL cholesterol. According to  researchers , high levels of LDL cholesterol are a risk factor for heart disease.
Oats are also a great source of several other micronutrients, including manganese, phosphorus, magnesium, and thiamine.
Select steel cut or rolled oats instead of highly processed varieties, such as instant oatmeal.
A 1 cup (33 gram) serving of cooked oats contains 23 grams of net carbs. Oats are also high in beta-glucan, a type of fiber that may help lower levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol.

2. Quinoa
Although technically classified as a pseudocereal,  quinoa  is often prepared and enjoyed as a grain.
Quinoa is loaded with beneficial antioxidants and polyphenols. According to  researchers , these properties can help decrease inflammation and protect against chronic disease.

Researchers  have also found that quinoa is also one of the few plant-based  complete protein sources . This means that it contains all nine of the essential amino acids the body needs to obtain from food sources.
Additionally, quinoa is high in other key nutrients, including manganese, magnesium, phosphorus, copper, and folate.
Quinoa contains 34 grams of net carbs per cooked cup (185 grams). It’s also high in antioxidants and contains all nine of the essential amino acids that your body needs.

In particular, it’s a great source of manganese, iron, magnesium, and  B vitamins .
A cup (182 grams) of  cooked bulgur  contains 26 grams of carbs and over 8 grams of fiber.
One cup (182 grams) of cooked bulgur contains 26 grams of net carbs. Bulgur is also versatile, easy to prepare, and rich in manganese, iron, magnesium, and B vitamins.

4. Millet
Millet  is a type of ancient grain that’s cultivated around the world.
Like other whole grains, millet is high in antioxidants and polyphenols. According to  researchers , this may help prevent chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes.
Millet is also a good source of fiber and relatively low in net carbs, making it a great addition to a healthy, low carb diet. A 1 cup (174 gram) serving of  cooked millet  contains over 2 grams of fiber and 39 grams of net carbs.
Millet is also high in a variety of other vitamins and minerals, including phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and folate.

5. Couscous
Couscous  is a processed grain product that’s typically made from semolina flour or durum wheat.
A staple in many Middle Eastern and Moroccan dishes, couscous is relatively low in carbs. It contains around 35 grams of net carbs and 2 grams of fiber in each 1 cup (157 gram) serving of  cooked couscous .
Couscous is also packed with selenium. According to  researchers , selenium is a trace mineral that plays a crucial role in heart health, thyroid function, immune health, and more.
Adding couscous to your diet can also boost your intake of several other important micronutrients, including pantothenic acid, manganese, copper, and thiamine.
Couscous is a grain product with 35 grams of net carbs per cooked cup (157 grams). In addition to providing plenty of selenium, couscous is high in pantothenic acid, manganese, copper, and thiamine.

6. Wild rice
Wild rice  is a type of grain derived from grasses in the  Zizania  genus of plants.
Compared with other types of rice, wild rice is significantly lower in carbs, with 32 grams of net carbs and 3 grams of fiber in each 1 cup (164 gram) serving of  cooked wild rice .
Plus, wild rice is brimming with health-promoting  antioxidants .

Wild rice is lower in carbs than other types of rice, with 32 grams of net carbs per cooked cup (164 grams). It is also high in antioxidants, along with zinc, vitamin B6, and folate.

7. Spelt
Also sometimes referred to as hulled wheat or dinkel wheat,  spelt  is an ancient whole grain. According to  researchers , it is associated with a number of health benefits.
Studies  show that eating more  whole grains , such as spelt, may be associated with a lower risk of certain types of cancer.  Research  also found that consumption of whole grains could lower the risk of type 2 diabetes.
Although spelt contains mostly carbs, it does offer a good chunk of fiber in each serving.
A 1 cup (194 gram) serving of  cooked spelt  contains about 7.5 grams of fiber and 43.5 grams of net carbs.
Spelt is also rich in niacin, magnesium, zinc, and manganese.

8. Popcorn
Most people think of  popcorn  as little more than a snack food, but it is technically a whole grain.
It’s also one of the lowest carb grains available, with around 6 grams of net carbs in each 1 cup (14 gram) serving of  popped popcorn .
Plus, popcorn is low in calories and high in B vitamins, iron, magnesium, and phosphorus.
Opt for air-popped popcorn whenever possible to maximize the nutritional value. This is because many prepared varieties are high in unhealthy fats, added sugar, and artificial flavorings, which can negate potential health benefits.

High carb grains to watch out for
Although many types of grains can fit into a healthy,  low carb diet , some types of grains contain a high number of carbs that are also low in fiber.
Refined grains, in particular, are grain products that have undergone processing to alter their texture and prolong shelf life.
This results in a lower content of fiber, which can increase the number of net carbs in the final product.
A few examples of grains that are high in carbs include:
white bread
refined pasta
white rice
crackers
breakfast cereal
pizza dough
potato chips
instant oatmeal
Keep in mind that if you’re cutting carbs, you may still need to limit many healthy whole grains, depending on how restrictive your diet is.
For example, very low carbohydrate or  ketogenic diets  often limit carb intake to less than 50 grams per day, which can make it challenging to fit any grains into your daily allotment of carbs.
Refined grains have undergone processing to improve their texture and shelf life. These foods are typically lower in fiber and higher in net carbs than whole grains.

Takeaway
Although many low carb diets do not eliminate grains, many varieties can fit into a healthy, carb-controlled diet.
In fact, many types of grains are high in fiber and low in net carbs, which is the number of carbs the body actually absorbs.
For best results, be sure to select whole grain varieties and steer clear of grains that have been heavily processed or refined whenever possible.
