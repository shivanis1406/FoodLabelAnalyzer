Title: 6 Fantastic Health Benefits of Greek Yogurt

Greek yogurt is a protein-rich dairy product that’s high in many nutrients like vitamin B12, calcium, and selenium. But, its nutritional value and health benefits can vary depending on the brand you choose.
Greek yogurt is an excellent source of a number of nutrients and may even offer a few health benefits. However, it’s important to choose the right type and brand, as many can be packed with additives like added sugar.
This article explains what makes Greek yogurt a healthy choice and what to look for when shopping for this popular dairy product.

What is Greek yogurt?
Yogurt is a dairy product that has been consumed since ancient times. In fact, the Greeks were the first to document the use of yogurt in 100 BC ( 1 ).
The word “yogurt” is believed to have come from the Turkish word “yoğurmak,” which means to thicken, curdle, or coagulate.
Many types of  yogurt  are available, including Greek-style, which has a higher protein content than other yogurt products ( 1 ).
Greek yogurt, often referred to as “strained” yogurt, is made by fermenting yogurt in tanks and then straining whey and other liquids during the final processing steps. The process results in a thicker product with a  higher protein content .
Additionally, some food manufacturers produce Greek-style yogurt by adding milk proteins to the yogurt at the beginning or end of processing ( 2 ).
Greek yogurt comes in many varieties, including full fat, reduced fat, and fat-free, as well as flavored and unflavored.
Greek yogurt is high in many nutrients and a good source of protein, fat, and carbs, depending on the brand you choose.
Here’s the nutrition breakdown of a 7-ounce (200-gram) serving of low fat, plain, unsweetened Greek yogurt ( 3 ).
Calories : 146
Protein : 20 grams
Fat : 3.8 grams
Carbs : 7.8 grams
B12 : 43% of the Daily Value (DV)
Riboflavin (B2) : 35% of the DV
Pantothenic acid (B5) : 19% of the DV
Vitamin A : 20% of the DV
Calcium : 18% of the DV
Phosphorus : 22% of the DV
Potassium : 6% of the DV
Zinc : 11% of the DV
Selenium : 45% of the DV
As you can see, Greek yogurt provides a number of nutrients and is particularly rich in protein,  vitamin B12 , riboflavin (B2), and selenium.
It’s also a good source of calcium, phosphorus, zinc,  pantothenic acid , vitamin A, and potassium. Additionally, Greek yogurt contains smaller amounts of nutrients like magnesium, choline, and copper.
Compared with regular yogurt, Greek yogurt is higher in protein and lower in carbs ( 4 ).
Keep in mind that its nutritional content will vary depending on the type of Greek yogurt. For example, full fat Greek yogurt will be higher in fat and calories than lower fat options, while sweetened and flavored options will be higher in carbs and added sugar.

Greek yogurt health benefits
Given Greek yogurt’s impressive nutrient profile, it has been linked to several health benefits.
One of the main benefits of Greek yogurt is that it’s rich in protein, a macronutrient needed for virtually all chemical reactions in the body, healthy immune function, tissue repair, and more ( 5 ).
Protein needs vary, but a protein intake of 0.54–0.9 grams per pound (1.2–2 grams per kg) of body weight is likely optimal for physically active people ( 6 ).
A 7-ounce (200-gram) serving of Greek yogurt provides 20 grams of protein, which makes it a high protein food.
In addition to protein, Greek yogurt is rich in essential vitamins and minerals including B12,  selenium , and zinc — all of which play important roles in supporting your health.
For example, both  zinc  and selenium are required for optimal immune function, while B12 is needed for red blood cell formation, nervous system function, and energy production ( 7 ,  8 ).
Greek yogurt contains a number of nutrients that are necessary for maintaining the health of the skeletal system, including protein, calcium, magnesium, and  phosphorus  ( 9 ).
Not only are the nutrients found in Greek yogurt required for bone health maintenance, but eating Greek yogurt may even help increase bone formation.
A small study among young men found that consuming Greek yogurt daily while participating in a resistance-training program for 12 weeks helped  increase bone formation  and decrease bone breakdown compared with a placebo ( 10 ).
Yogurt intake has also been linked to greater bone mineral density and a lower risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis among older adults ( 11 ).
Research suggests that eating yogurt regularly may help support a healthy digestive system by  increasing bacterial diversity  in the guts of some people ( 12 ).
However, the type of Greek yogurt consumed matters. Purchasing yogurt with a “ Live & Active Cultures (LAC) seal ” ensures that the yogurt contains a significant amount of beneficial bacteria or probiotics, which may help support gut health.
Also, it’s important to only choose unsweetened Greek yogurt, as research shows that added sugar can harm gut health and  contribute to dysbiosis  or bacterial imbalance ( 13 ).
Consuming enough protein is essential for promoting overall health and muscle recovery.
Greek yogurt is a great  post-workout snack  option for athletes. Its high protein content may promote muscle protein synthesis and recovery ( 14 ,  15 ).
A study in young men found that consuming yogurt daily for 12 weeks while participating in a resistance-training program led to  greater gains in muscle strength , muscle thickness, and fat-free mass compared with a placebo ( 16 ).
Protein is the most filling macronutrient, and  adding sources of protein  — such as dairy — to meals and snacks is a smart way to help you feel satisfied between meals ( 17 ).
Because yogurt is a filling, protein-rich food, choosing yogurt and other high protein foods over less filling foods can help support a healthy body weight.
A review of 22 studies concluded that yogurt consumption is associated with lower body fat, less weight gain, and smaller waist circumference ( 18 ).
However, remember that your overall  diet and lifestyle  matters most when it comes to reaching and maintaining a healthy body weight.
In addition to providing a number of nutrients and being linked to a few potential health benefits, Greek yogurt is a versatile ingredient that tastes great in both sweet and savory recipes alike.
Here are a few ways to use Greek yogurt in your kitchen:
Top Greek yogurt with fresh or frozen  berries , chopped nuts like almonds or walnuts, unsweetened coconut, and chia seeds for a filling breakfast.
Use it as a base for sweet and savory dips.
Add Greek yogurt to soups and curries for a creamy texture.
Top  oatmeal , pancakes, baked potatoes, and chili with a dollop of Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.
Use it to make homemade  salad dressings .
Try out Greek yogurt in chicken, tuna, and pasta salads.
Make frozen desserts like yogurt pops out of Greek yogurt.
Add it to  smoothies  for a punch of protein.
These are just a few ways to use Greek yogurt. Don’t be afraid to experiment with Greek yogurt in recipes of your own!

What to look for when shopping for Greek yogurt
When shopping for Greek yogurt, there are a few things to keep in mind.
Most yogurts on the market are flavored and sweetened, and they can contain a significant amount of added sugar.
For example, some flavored, sweetened varieties can contain upwards of  16 grams  of added sugar per serving. That’s about 4 teaspoons of added sugar.
While you don’t have to avoid sugar at all costs for optimal health, it’s important to limit your intake of added sugar.
That’s because consuming  too much added sugar  can contribute to health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, fatty liver, depression, and obesity ( 19 ,  20 ,  21 ,  22 ).
As such, it’s a smart choice to purchase unsweetened Greek yogurt and add your own toppings, such as fruit, for natural sweetness.
In terms of fat content, keep in mind that Greek yogurt made with whole milk contains more fat and calories than low fat or fat-free yogurt, but that doesn’t mean it’s unhealthy ( 23 ).
In fact, full fat dairy  may have more health benefits than  reduced fat or skim dairy.
If you prefer full fat Greek yogurt, that’s perfectly OK. The same goes for fat-free Greek yogurt.

The bottom line
Greek yogurt is a type of yogurt that’s high in protein and other nutrients like vitamin B12, calcium, and selenium.
It’s linked to a few health benefits, such as supporting muscle and bone health, and certain types may help contribute to a healthy gut.
Plus, it’s a filling and nutritious kitchen staple that can be used in a variety of both sweet and savory recipes.
