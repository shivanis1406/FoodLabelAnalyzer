Healthline’s picks of the best foam rollers
Density/firmness :  medium
Size :  13 × 5.5 inches (33 × 14 cm)
Weight limit :  500 pounds (227 kg)
Warranty from manufacturer :  1 year
Price:  $$ Looking for a roller that will stand the test of time? The TriggerPoint GRID Foam Roller’s core helps it keep its shape even after years of use. It’s best if you’re seeking a fairly firm roller with a ridged surface. This roller’s bumps and ridges not only simulate a hands-on massage but also get deep into your tissue if you want deeper pressure. This product comes in bright, fun colors and includes access to free online instructional videos from fitness experts at TriggerPoint.
Density/firmness :  medium to high
Size :  14.5 × 5.5 inches (37 × 14 cm)
Materials :  bamboo and recyclable aluminum
Weight limit :  350 pounds (159 kg)
Price:  $$$ Foam rollers aren’t always great for packing, but the Brazyn Morph Collapsible Roller has solved this common problem. When folded down, this fully collapsable roller is only 1.9 inches (4.8 cm) thick, so it’ll easily fit into your gym bag or carry-on luggage. It also weighs only 1.5 pounds (0.7 kg). The foam is on the softer side, and it’s easy to collapse by pushing on the disks on the end of the roller. It’s also easy to return to normal roller shape with a tug on the pull ropes. Note that some customers reported their rollers collapsing on them during use.
Density/firmness :  medium
Size :  12 × 4 inches (30.5 × 10 cm)
Price:  $ Looking for a cheaper alternative? The Gaiam Restore Compact Foam Roller doesn’t fully break down like the Brazyn Morph Collapsible Roller, but its small size makes it easy to carry around anywhere. It’s a moderate density option that offers texturing on the roller. Many customers felt it was a steal given the rigorous arm and leg work it allows.
Density/firmness :  high
Size :  36 × 6 inches (91.5 × 15 cm)
Weight :  0.84 pounds (0.38 kg)
Price:  $ The Amazon Basic High Density Round Foam Roller is a no-frills option with high customer reviews. The texture on a roller may help stimulate muscles, but a smooth roller distributes pressure evenly when massaging muscles (especially if it’s high density). This even distribution of pressure may help prevent bruising. Thus, though this Amazon Basic product doesn’t have texture, it’s still very effective.
Density/firmness :  medium
Size :  36 × 6 inches (91.5 × 15 cm)
Materials :  EVA foam
Weight :  1.96 pounds (0.89 kg)

Density/firmness :  firmness
Sizes :  12 × 6 inches (30.5 × 15 cm), 18 × 6 inches (46 × 15 cm), 36 × 6 inches (91.5 × 15 cm)

Size :  36 × 6 × 3 inches (91.5 × 15 × 7.5 cm)

Density/firmness :  high
Length :  13 or 26 inches (33 or 66 cm)
Price:  $$ This roller’s unusual hollow core and sharp edge allow for three intensity levels, which range from low to high pressure depending on the angle and side. This range of pressures means that this product can take the place of several types of rollers. The manufacturer encourages using a rocking motion instead of a rolling motion to maximize intensity.
Density/firmness :  medium
Size :  11.6 × 5.3 inches (29.5 × 13.5 cm)
Weight :  3 pounds (1.5 kg)
Price:  $$$$ If you’re looking for more muscle stimulation than what’s provided by a standard foam roller, a vibrating roller may be what you need. The manufacturer claims that this particular roller can increase mobility by 40%, compared with the normal 18% improvement of regular foam rolling. It offers a total of three vibration settings. It’s also cordless and compact, so it’s easy to take with you on the go. What’s more, it’s dual-sized, offering both grooved and smooth options depending on your preferences.
Density/firmness :  medium
Length :  18 inches (46 cm)
Warranty :  3 years
Price:  $$ The long and lightweight style of this stick means it’s easy to angle into any part of your body. The foam covering also ensures that you won’t accidentally cause discomfort by digging in too far. Importantly, the rubber grips won’t shift in your hands as you apply pressure to your sore muscles. While you won’t be able to get the same amount of pressure on your muscles as when using a traditional foam roller, you can easily take this stick on the go or keep it at your desk at work.
