What is sacha inchi?
Plukenetia volubilis , or sacha inchi, is a perennial plant native to certain parts of South America and the Caribbean. It produces a fruit that’s cultivated for its large, edible seeds.
Because it was traditionally consumed by indigenous groups in Peru, it’s sometimes referred to as mountain peanut or Inca nut.
Although the fruit itself is not commonly consumed, the seeds are roasted and eaten. They’re also ground into a fine powder and added to food products. Plus, the oil is extracted from the seeds and used in cooking or skin care products.
Additionally, the leaves of the plant can be dried and brewed to make an  herbal tea .

Nutrition
Sacha inchi seeds are rich in protein, fiber, and heart healthy fats.
A 0.4-ounce (10-gram) serving of sacha inchi seeds contains ( 1 ):
Calories:  70
Protein:  3 grams
Fat:  5 grams
Carbs:  1 gram
Fiber:  1 gram
The seeds are particularly high in  unsaturated fat , which may be associated with a lower risk of heart disease when used in place of saturated fats or carbohydrates in your diet ( 2 ).
They also contain other important micronutrients, such as phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and zinc ( 3 ).
What’s more, they contain antioxidants and phenolic compounds that may reduce inflammation in your body and protect against chronic disease ( 4 ,  5 ).
Sacha inchi seeds are rich in protein, fiber, and heart healthy fats. They also contain several essential micronutrients and antioxidants.

Potential benefits
Sacha inchi seeds may be linked to several powerful health benefits.
Some research suggests that sacha inchi could support healthy cholesterol levels.
A small study in 30 people found that participants who took 10–15 mL of sacha inchi seed oil daily for 4 months had improved blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, and HDL (good) cholesterol levels compared with a control group who received sunflower oil ( 6 ).
In another small study in 42 adults, consuming sacha inchi oil with a high fat meal prevented increases in  cholesterol levels  and inflammation, but the outcomes also depended on the individuals’ metabolic status ( 7 ).
Sacha inchi is also a great source of unsaturated fatty acids, a type of fat that could help reduce cholesterol levels and support heart health ( 8 ).
Although studies in humans are limited, some animal studies suggest that sacha inchi could improve digestive health.
For instance, one study found that administering sacha inchi oil to rats on a high fat diet helped balance the beneficial bacteria in the gut ( 9 ).
Another study similarly found that extract from the seed’s hulls improved the health of the gut microbiome in rats ( 10 ).
The seeds also contain a good amount of fiber in each serving ( 1 ).
Fiber is a beneficial plant compound that can improve regularity by bulking up your stool. This can help protect against conditions like hemorrhoids and  diverticulitis , a condition characterized by infection or inflammation in the gut ( 11 ).
One 0.4-ounce (10-gram) serving of sacha inchi seeds provides 70 calories along with a good amount of protein and fiber. This makes them a great excellent addition to a well-rounded  weight loss diet .
Protein, in particular, can decrease food cravings and support appetite control to increase weight loss ( 12 ).
Similarly, fiber can increase feelings of fullness to help reduce your overall food intake, which could contribute to weight loss and fat loss ( 13 ,  14 ).
Lastly, sacha inchi is rich in heart healthy fats, which can slow the emptying of your stomach and promote feelings of fullness ( 15 ).
Some research suggests that sacha inchi could improve cholesterol levels, enhance gut health, and increase weight loss. Still, more studies in humans are needed to confirm these promising benefits.

Potential side effects
When enjoyed in moderation, sacha inchi is associated with few side effects and can be a healthy addition to a balanced diet for most people.
In one study, the most common side effect linked to taking sacha inchi oil was nausea, although this decreased over time with continued use ( 6 ).
Although rare, allergic reactions to the plant have also been reported. If you experience any negative effects after consuming it, it’s best to discontinue use and talk with a healthcare professional if your symptoms persist ( 16 ).
It’s also worth noting that raw sacha inchi seeds contain  antinutrients  and alkaloids ( 17 ).
Antinutrients are compounds that can hinder the absorption of micronutrients in your body, and alkaloids can negatively impact health. Alkaloids may even be lethal if consumed in large amounts ( 17 ).
Thankfully, research shows that oven-roasting the seeds significantly reduces their content of alkaloids and antinutrients while enhancing antioxidant activity. Therefore, it’s important to roast them before eating them ( 17 ,  18 ).
Sacha inchi is generally safe, though it may cause nausea in some people and could cause an allergic reaction in rare cases. The raw seeds contain potentially harmful antinutrients and alkaloids, but these are reduced with oven-roasting.

How to use
Sacha inchi is available in several forms. The seeds, in particular, are often roasted or ground into a powder.
The roasted seeds have a mild, nutty flavor and can be enjoyed as is for a simple snack on the go. You can also swap them in for other nuts in your diet and add them to salads, trail mixes, or granola.
Meanwhile, the ground seeds are found in  plant-based protein powders , great to use in smoothies, baked goods, or energy bites.
The leaves of the plant can be dried and steeped in water for a few minutes to make a flavorful herbal tea.
Lastly, you can apply the oil to your skin or drizzle it over salads, smoothies, or sautéed veggies to boost the flavor and health benefits.
You can enjoy roasted sacha inchi seeds in recipes or as a snack, find the ground seeds in protein powders, use the leaves to make herbal tea, and apply the oil to your skin or drizzle it over dishes like salads or pasta.

The bottom line
Sacha inchi is a plant that’s often cultivated for its large, nut-like seeds.
These seeds are highly nutritious and may be associated with several health benefits, including improved cholesterol levels, increased weight loss, and improved  gut health . However, more research in humans is needed to confirm these promising results.
They’re also incredibly versatile and can be used whole and roasted, ground into a powder, or pressed into oil. Thus, you can add them to recipes, enjoy them as a snack, or incorporate them into smoothies and baked goods.
Try this today:  If you can find sacha inchi protein powder, blend a scoop with your favorite smoothie ingredients for a wholesome drink for breakfast or refueling after a workout. Tasty ideas include a frozen banana, a handful of strawberries, a dash of vanilla extract, a cup of plant-based milk, and a tablespoon of nut butter.
