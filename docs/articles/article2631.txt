Title: Delicious Ways to Repurpose 12 Types of Leftovers

While clipping coupons and cutting back on high-dollar items are always smart choices for saving green at the supermarket, there’s another way to stretch your grocery dollars: loving on your  leftovers .
Though leftovers may not be the most glamorous of foods, using them up can make a significant dent in your weekly food bill.
Believe it or not, repurposing them into new, exciting meals can create surprisingly delicious (not to mention time-saving) finished products.
With food costs  on the rise , you’re not alone if you’re focusing on getting the most out of your grocery budget.
Here’s your guide to putting twelve common leftover foods on double-duty for tasty, budget-friendly results.

Rice
Whether white,  brown , or wild, rice is one of the most popular grains on the planet. When you find yourself with an extra cup or two, there’s a whole world of options for using it up.
Some ideas are:
fried rice
arancini (fried rice balls)
rice pudding
If extra  white or brown rice  is taking up space in your fridge, consider tossing together a vegetable fried rice. It’s an excellent way to pack in colorful veggies in a quick and easy plant-based meal.
This  savory edamame fried rice , for example, goes from stovetop to table in just 30 minutes.
Got some extra arborio rice from a risotto? Give it new life as arancini, aka Italian fried rice balls. Check out this  tomato-basil version .
If you want to go the sweet route, finish off a meal with a sweet rice pudding, like  this four-ingredient recipe  featuring coconut milk and agave syrup.

Ground beef, pork, or turkey
Ground meat is a mainstay of mixed dishes like tacos, casseroles, and pastas.
Since they’re often seasoned in an original dish, you may face some unique challenges when attempting to repurpose these meats as leftovers.
Still, all is not lost! Try one of the swaps below.
There’s nothing like a simple hash for a no-brainer breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
Toss seasoned, cooked ground meat in a skillet with veggies and beans. You can’t go wrong with sweet potato chunks, black beans, or bell peppers.
Or make it  Mediterranean  with a hash of ground meat, sun-dried tomatoes,  kale , and cannellini beans.
Meanwhile, if you’ve used ground meat in tacos one night, try a different spin on Mexican cuisine later in the week. Spicy ground turkey or beef makes a welcome addition to  chilaquiles , flautas, or tostadas.
We’re not done yet!
You can also repurpose ground meats in curry, where spices like  cumin , curry powder, and garlic cover—or complement—other seasonings.
Check out these  red curry sloppy banh mi sandwiches . They’re a cross between sloppy joes and the classic Vietnamese sammie.

Chicken
Chicken has dethroned beef as the  most-cooked meat  in American households.
Since it’s the protein base of so many meals, you may find yourself looking for chicken leftover inspiration more than other ingredients.
Barbecue chicken is an especially versatile contender for top-notch leftovers.
Extras of this type of chicken can top a pizza, fill wraps, or amp up a one-dish meal like  chicken and coleslaw potato skins .
Got chicken of another flavor persuasion? Pop it into a creamy pasta, place it in a quesadilla with melted cheese, or build a gourmet sandwich around it.

Fish
Because of its short shelf life, leftover fish is notoriously tough to repurpose.
In the famous words of Benjamin Franklin, “Guests, like fish, begin to smell after three days.”
Still, if you can reuse cooked fish in a short timeframe, you’ll be well on your way to a second meal rich in  vitamin D  and healthy  omega-3 fatty acids .
For starters, just about any fish can serve as the filling of a wrap.
For a quick, high-fiber lunch packed with antioxidants, roll up leftover fish in a  whole wheat tortilla  with fresh spinach or kale, sliced veggies like bell peppers and cucumbers, and a light dressing of your choice.
Or, if you’ve got a sturdy fish like  salmon  hanging around, make it a kabob night.
Thread cooked salmon chunks onto skewers along with sauteed slices of asparagus, zucchini, and/or squash, brushed with olive oil. Instant dinner!

Veggies
Hmm…what to do with that little bit of extra veggies? You may wonder if they were even worth saving in the first place.
Fortunately, vegetables are among the most versatile of leftover foods.
Pre-cooked veggies make the perfect filling for an easy quiche. Here’s how:
Ingredients:
store-bought pie crust
leftover cooked veggies
shredded cheese
5 eggs
2 tbsp milk
Directions:
First, line a pie plate with your crust.
Layer on cooked veggies, and top with a sprinkle of cheese.
Beat eggs with milk and pour it over your crust.
Bake at 400°F for 20-25 minutes or until eggs are set.
Then, of course, there’s a panoply of soups and stews that welcome leftover veggies with open arms. Reap the health benefits of  adding extra vegetables  to robust soups like chili or  this tasty southwestern veggie noodle soup .
Even vegetable scraps can stretch their usefulness in a DIY vegetable broth. Try  this one  as a starter — but feel free to add or subtract any veggies you like.

Quinoa
What do Buddha bowls and casseroles have in common—besides rhyming? They’re both ideal second homes for nutrient-dense grains like  quinoa .
Check out this  cheesy chicken, broccoli, and quinoa casserole  or these  eight healthy grain bowl ideas .
Fluffy, cooked quinoa can also shape-shift its way into tasty patties. Try this:
Ingredients:
1 cup cooked quinoa
3 eggs
½ cup shredded cheese
½ cup bread crumbs
pinch of garlic powder
2 tsp olive oil
Directions:
Mix all ingredients in a bowl.
Form into patties.
Pan-fry on medium-high heat until brown and crispy.
Serve with ketchup,  tzatziki , or your favorite dipping sauce.

Bread
It seems like those last couple of slices of bread always linger forlornly on the counter.
When you don’t have quite enough bread to whip up french toast, consider another, more nutritious breakfast option.
We’re not talking  avocado toast —though, with its wealth of healthy fats and fiber, it’s certainly not a bad option.
Instead, try spreading a schmear of hummus on toasted bread, then topping it with chopped Medjool dates. You’ll get a high-fiber, slightly sweet breakfast rich in vitamin B6 and polyphenols.
Or, simply toast extra bread and grind it in the food processor for bread crumbs to sprinkle on a spinach salad or mac and cheese.
You can transform bread that’s gone a bit dry into a delicious, cheesy culinary experience with this  mushroom and gruyere bread pudding recipe.  No gruyere on hand? Try this  savory breakfast bread and sausage pudding .
If you’re in the mood for a sweet treat, break out the  nutella  for this tasty bread pudding crowd-pleaser that even kids will like.

Mashed potatoes
For those times when you actually have leftover mashed potatoes (because how often does this creamy wonder go uneaten?), remember: They can be far more than a side dish for ham or chicken.
Mashed potatoes make a lovely filling for samosas.
Ingredients:
4 or more cups of leftover mashed potatoes
one Tbsp. olive oil
one c. diced onion
one c. fresh, canned, or frozen peas
½ Tbsp. curry powder
⅛ tsp. salt
⅛ tsp. pepper
one 9-inch store-bought pie crust
Directions:
Sauté peas and onions in olive oil with curry powder, salt, and pepper until tender.
In a large bowl, mix with leftover mashed potatoes.
Roll out store-bought pie crust and cut into triangles.
Fill each triangle with a portion of the mashed potato mixture, seal the edges, and bake at 375°F 20-25 minutes.
Pre-made mashed taters are also an ideal shortcut for shepherd’s pie. Try  this veggie-loaded version .

Sauces and condiments
A lonely quarter-jar of marinara might not seem like a recipe for dinnertime inspiration, but that doesn’t mean it’s without its uses.
When you’ve only got a little bit of a sauce left, think of it as a  condiment  rather than a coating for an entire recipe. Most sauces can easily accompany fritters, gyoza, and other bite-sized foods as dip, including:
marinara
barbecue sauce
Alfredo
teriyaki
jam
glaze
For an elegant (but oh-so-simple) way to use up extra sauces and condiments, serve as part of a  charcuterie board .
A small bowl of jam, a dollop of honey mustard, or a couple of spoonfuls of pesto add pizzazz to the meats, cheeses, and crackers in this easy dinner.

Herbs
You used up half a bunch of  cilantro  for guacamole one night… now what?
Luckily, you can freeze many types of herbs, especially sturdier ones like rosemary, sage, and thyme. Preserved in your freezer, they’ll serve you well when it’s time to make stews, braised meats, or pastas.
Still, there’s a more unexpected (and immediately useful) destination for herbs:  your water bottle !
Simply place fresh herbs in a glass or bottle along with any other flavor enhancers like sliced citrus fruits or berries for refreshing all-day sipping.
There are even  infuser bottles  especially for this purpose!
If you’ve got a larger amount of fresh herbs leftover, homemade pesto is always an option, too. This  basil-parsley pesto  knocks out two different herbs at once.

Salad
Leftover salad probably isn’t anyone’s favorite food. Especially when dressed, greens tend to turn to mush in the fridge after just a few hours. To save salad leftovers from a certain fate in the garbage bin, be sure to use them within 24 hours.
To repurpose last night’s salad (including its toppings), bundle the whole thing into a wrap, adding extra protein or a few fresh leaves to spruce things up, if possible.
Or, if you’re able to salvage leafy greens like spinach or kale from leftover salad, try tossing them in the mix as you put together  meatloaf  or  falafel .
Even if they’re a bit wilted, no one will be the wiser.
Pasta dishes are another vehicle where slightly faded greens can add their abundant nutrients (without having to look crisp and perky).
This  baked penne pasta with spinach and feta  easily adopts leftover spinach.

Beans
Making a big pot of beans is a classic meal prep strategy — and reusing leftover beans can similarly stretch one meal into two (or more).
When refried beans remain after taco Tuesday, stuff them into tamales, like  this simple bean and cheese variety .
You can also use them as a nacho topping or layer them into mini tostada cups with melted cheese for a simple appetizer.
Got half a can of beans waiting for a dinner assignment?
Consider tossing drained, rinsed beans like  great Northerns, cannellinis , or  black beans  onto a green salad or  pasta salad , or pop them into a soup or chili.
Even a handful of leftover legumes like  chickpeas  can be  fried with herbs  for a crunchy snack or mashed into a high-fiber filling for sandwiches or  wraps .

Bottom line
Despite their somewhat lackluster reputation, leftovers are a secret weapon for extending your grocery budget and cutting down on meal prep time.
Repurposing the 12 common foods above provides a jumping-off point for countless breakfasts, lunches, and dinners.
So shake off the typecasting of leftovers as boring — and before you toss them in the trash, give some thought to how you might toss them into an additional, satisfying meal.
