Title: What Are the Health Benefits of Black Seed Oil?

Research suggests black seed has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties that may help with conditions like psoriasis, asthma, hair loss, and acne. More studies in humans are needed to confirm most of these potential benefits.
Black seed oil is an herbal ingredient derived from Nigella sativa, native to Eastern Europe and Western Asia.
Preliminary evidence supports a few medicinal properties, primarily due to the seed’s high content of antioxidants and other bioactive compounds. Here are some potential health benefits of black seed.

May reduce acne
Some research shows that external applications of black seed oil could benefit skin conditions like  acne  due to its  antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties .
A 2020 study found that using a topical gel made with black seed extract twice daily for 60 days reduced acne severity by  78% . Researchers also noted a significant improvement in the number of acne lesions in study participants compared to those in a control group.

Could help treat psoriasis
Although more human studies are needed, research generally shows that Nigella sativa extract has anti-inflammatory benefits, and  animal studies  suggest that black seed oil could reduce skin inflammation and other symptoms of  psoriasis .
A  2017 review  also found that combining oral and topical forms of black seed extract reduces symptoms of psoriasis and improves skin lesions.

Promotes wound healing
Black seed oil contains a compound called thymoquinone, which , when applied directly to the skin, may  stimulate tissue growth  and facilitate wound healing .
The 2017 review mentioned before also noted that animal studies have found that thymoquinone, due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial effects, may help treat burns, excisions, and other types of wounds. The oil seems to increase collagen production and have moisturizing effects, both beneficial to  wound healing .

May support hair health and growth
Black seed extract may be  good for the hair . It is often added to hair care products, including  masks and shampoos. A  2020 review  highlighted a small study in which the daily us e of a Nigella sativa extract lotion for 3 months significantly increased hair density and thickness in people with  telogen effluvium , a common form of hair loss.
The same review found a study with 90 participants using different seed oils for hair loss. Nigella sativa oil was the most effective at reducing hair loss.

May protect lung health and reduce asthma attacks
A  2020 review  found a small study indicating that inhaled boiled black seed extract has a potential bronchodilatory effect on people with asthma, improving all markers of lung function and respiratory rate (i.e., helping them breathe better.)
A  2021 meta-analysis  of four randomized controlled studies also found that black seed supplements may help manage asthma through the seed’s anti-inflammatory effects.
More clinical data is needed to confirm the potential benefits of black seed oil for lung health.
Before using any form of black seed, it’s important to consult with a healthcare professional to avoid allergic reactions or other adverse effects.

Could aid in the treatment of vitiligo
Some research suggests that black seed oil  could be beneficial  for treating vitiligo, a disorder that causes loss of pigmentation in the skin.
One study  of 33 people  with vitiligo found that twice-daily skin application of a cream made with black seed oil  improved pigmentation in the hands, face, and genital region after 6 months.
Researchers suggest that black seed oil’s benefits for vitiligo may be due to its ability to spread melanin within the skin. Melanin is a natural pigment found in hair, skin, and eyes. More research is needed.

Reduces local and systemic inflammation
Studies  have shown that black seed oil has powerful anti-inflammatory properties. This could benefit multiple aspects of health, as  research  suggests that inflammation contributes to the development of chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.

May support weight loss
A study of 45 women with overweight or obesity showed that taking 2,000 mg of black seed oil daily for  8 weeks  decreased appetite and reduced body mass index, body weight, waist circumference, and body fat.
Few studies have examined the long-term use of black seed oil, so caution is highly advised when taking the supplement in large quantities and for a long time. Also, contrary to prescription drugs, supplements are not strongly regulated in the United States, which could lead to safety concerns.

Improves blood sugar levels
Some research shows that black seed oil could be beneficial for stabilizing blood sugar levels.  A 2019 review , for example, found that black seed may improve multiple markers, including insulin levels and blood sugar levels during fasting and after a meal.

Could reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome
Research suggests that black seed oil could help reduce the risk of  metabolic syndrome , a cluster of conditions that can increase the chance of developing heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.
One clinical trial involved 55 people  with high blood pressure. Participants took 2.5 mL of black seed oil twice daily for 8 weeks. At the end of the study, those who received the dosage showed improvement in different aspects. Most of them experienced reduced diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, and fasting blood sugar levels.
However, research has often shown that a well-rounded, whole-food diet and an active lifestyle are the best prevention methods against metabolic syndrome. Supplements like black seed oil may add to a healthy lifestyle. It’s important to consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive treatment plan that applies to your individual health needs.

Frequently asked questions
Black seed oil is likely safe when consumed in small amounts, such as when used in cooking  or as a supplement for  less than 3 months . However, more research is still needed on the safety of taking it in larger amounts and for longer .
It is best to talk with a doctor before taking any supplement. It may be unsafe to take black seed oil if you are pregnant or have certain underlying health conditions.
Learn about the  safety and potential side effects of black seed oil.
Black seed oil is often an ingredient in shampoos and hair masks, as it has antimicrobial and antioxidant properties that  may help  support your overall hair health. Some evidence suggests that it may help with hair loss associated with inflammation or telogen effluvium.

The bottom line
Black seed oil may be a promising natural remedy for conditions such as vitiligo, hair loss, psoriasis, metabolic syndrome, and asthma. It may also help with inflammatory conditions and weight management.
It is important, however, to always check with a healthcare professional before taking any supplements or natural remedies, especially if you take prescription medications. Black seed may interact with other supplements and drugs or not work for your individual needs.
