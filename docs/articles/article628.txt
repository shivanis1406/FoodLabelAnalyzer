What is ginger tea?
Ginger  is one of the most common ingredients worldwide, used as a spice and medicinal plant.
In folk medicine, people often use it to treat coughs and the flu, among other ailments.
It has traditionally been used in numerous forms, including:
fresh
pickled
powdered
dried
candied
preserved
crystalized
Similarly, it is available in  multiple forms , such as:
capsules
tinctures
extracts
tablets
tea
As mentioned above, ginger tea is made by boiling the peeled root in water or milk.
The oils and compounds responsible for ginger’s characteristic aroma and spicy flavor make up about  1–4%  of the ginger root.
Two of these compounds —  gingerols and shogaols  — are considered ginger’s main bioactive components. This means they are the ones behind most of the health benefits of ginger and ginger tea.
Here are just some of the known and potential benefits of ginger tea.
You can make ginger tea by boiling the root in water. It has a sharp and spicy taste. It’s rich in gingerols and shogaols, the components behind many of its health benefits.

Health benefits of drinking ginger tea
Here are 7 potential health benefits of drinking ginger tea.
Folk medicine suggests that ginger tea can help calm  motion sickness  symptoms, like dizziness, vomiting, and cold sweats.
One  1988 study  in 80 naval cadets unaccustomed to sailing in heavy seas determined that those who received 1 gram of powdered ginger reported reduced vomiting and cold sweating.
Although researchers don’t understand exactly how ginger works, some have suggested that certain compounds in ginger  block a brain receptor  that has a key role in the vomiting center of the brain.
However, current research is  limited or inconclusive .
Yet, if you experience nausea from time to time, ginger tea may be a good treatment to try.
Some experts believe gingerols in ginger can help relieve  nausea caused by pregnancy , chemotherapy, or surgery.
Researchers suggest that ginger might be an effective and inexpensive alternative to traditional anti-nausea drugs in people who are  pregnant or undergoing chemotherapy  and can’t have conventional medicines.
One study  in 92 women found that ginger was more effective than a standard drug at preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting caused by general anesthesia.
Nevertheless, be sure to check with a healthcare professional before using ginger after surgery. It  may interfere with blood clotting  — although research on this is still emerging and more is needed to investigate it further.
Research suggests that consuming ginger in daily doses of 2–6 grams may help protect against  heart disease .
Ginger may do this by:
lowering blood pressure
helping prevent heart attacks
helping prevent blood clots
relieving  heartburn
lowering cholesterol
improving blood circulation
A lot of research shows that consuming ginger has beneficial effects on weight and blood sugar management.
Research suggests that ginger may help  manage body weight  by:
increasing thermogenesis — the production of heat by your body — which helps burn fat
increasing the breakdown of fats for energy
inhibiting fat storage
inhibiting fat absorption
helping control appetite
In addition, ginger may help improve blood sugar control in people with  type 2 diabetes  and  obesity  by reducing fasting insulin levels, hemoglobin A1C, and triglycerides.  Hemoglobin A1C  is an indication of your blood sugar levels over the past 2–3 months.
People have used ginger to treat inflammation for centuries, and now science backs up this practice for certain uses.
Research  shows that the compounds in ginger called gingerol and shogaol help reduce the production of pro-inflammatory markers.
People have particularly studied ginger for its effect in relieving pain from  osteoarthritis of the knee .
Ginger tea may also help alleviate  menstrual cramps  if you take it at the start of your period.  Research shows  it may be equally or more effective than over-the-counter pain relief medications.
Studies have even shown that ginger  may help prevent cancer , mostly due to its gingerol and shogaol content.
Test-tube studies have shown that gingerol and shogaol may contribute to ginger’s  cancer-fighting properties  by causing cell death and preventing cancer cell multiplication and growth.
Other test-tube studies have shown that ginger may affect several different types of cancer cells, including pancreatic, colon,  colorectal ,  ovarian , prostate, and lung cancers.
More studies on the effects of ginger and ginger tea on cancer in humans are needed.
Scientists have studied ginger’s protective effects against  oxidative stress  and inflammation — two factors that play a decisive role in the development of brain  degenerative diseases , such as Alzheimer’s disease.
Animal  studies  show that gingerol and shogaol may offer protection against  age-associated decline of brain functions  due to their antioxidant properties.
Test-tube studies also suggest that ginger extract may increase cell survival against beta-amyloid — a protein closely related to Alzheimer’s disease that can induce toxicity in brain cells.
Compounds such as gingerol and shogaol in ginger may offer beneficial effects for nausea, pain, inflammation, heart health, diabetes, cancer, and brain health.

Potential downsides
Drinking ginger tea is unlikely to cause serious side effects.
Ginger is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including for those who are breastfeeding or chestfeeding. The FDA says it is safe to consume up to 4 grams of ginger daily. However, these amounts are generally not reached in studies.
While there is no consensus on a correct dosage for ginger, studies recommend a safe daily dose of  1,000 mg  of fresh ginger.
This is the equivalent of 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of freshly grated ginger extract, 0.4 teaspoons (2 mL) of liquid ginger extract, 4 cups (946 mL) of prepackaged ginger tea, or 2 teaspoons (10 mL) of ginger syrup ( 1 ).
Note that ginger tea is likely less concentrated than these forms of ginger. So, while drinking ginger tea may have  side effects , you’re unlikely to experience them if you drink only one or two cups.
That said, if you think you’re experiencing side effects from drinking ginger tea, stop drinking it right away and consider speaking with a healthcare professional about your symptoms.
When people do experience side effects from consuming ginger, they most often report gas, bloating, nausea, and heartburn or reflux. Other reported symptoms include diarrhea and  abdominal pain .
Since ginger may lower blood pressure and may have a blood-thinning effect, people on blood thinners or blood pressure medications should consult their healthcare professional before consuming extra ginger.
Some of the most common side effects of drinking large amounts of ginger tea are gas, bloating, heartburn, and nausea. Studies recommend keeping your intake of prepackaged ginger tea under 4 cups per day.
