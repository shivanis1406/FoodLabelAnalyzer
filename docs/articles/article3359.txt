With up to 20 live classes per day and more than 7,000 streaming on-demand classes to choose from, Obé Fitness is a great option to help you meet your fitness goals.
The app includes a wide selection of different types of workout classes, including  high intensity interval training (HIIT) ,  strength training , cardio, and yoga.
Using the app, you can also start a workout party to exercise with your friends and stay motivated.
I loved the energy of Obé’s classes. The instructors and music were great, and I especially enjoyed the dance and HIIT classes. Plus, I was able to finish my workout in 20–28 minutes, which was super convenient since I tend to exercise in the mornings before my son wakes up.
However, it’s also worth noting that Obé is relatively expensive compared with some other similar streaming services and doesn’t connect with smart workout equipment.

Future is an app that pairs users with a personal coach based on their fitness goals and preferences.
After an initial video call, your coach will create a custom training plan and provide one-on-one support to help you stay motivated.
Depending on your needs and what equipment you have, your training plan may include a combination of strength training, cardio,  outdoor workouts , and more.
The app also provides detailed audio and video guidance to help you master new workout moves.
You’ll need an Apple Watch to access all of the app’s features and provide your coach with more detailed feedback about your workouts.
I was skeptical at first about how an at-home virtual personal trainer was going to motivate me, but I’ve definitely seen positive changes in my fitness habits.
I also really loved that I could get plenty of guidance to make sure I’m doing each exercise correctly. I was able to record a video of myself and send it to my personal trainer for feedback. Plus, it was easy to talk with my trainer if I needed to ask for a workout modification or if I had a question about an exercise.
Overall, I really appreciated having this level of one-on-one support and guidance. You can read more about my experience trying Future in this  in-depth review .

Nike Training Club is a free fitness app that offers unlimited access to a variety of on-demand workouts, including HIIT classes, yoga, and quick classes that are 20 minutes or less.
It also provides a variety of expert tips, live streams from Nike trainers, and additional resources on topics like nutrition, meditation, and  recovery .
The app syncs with Apple Health to record heart rate data and allows you to log daily workouts to keep tabs on your progress.
It is completely free to use and available on both iPhone and Android devices.
I think Nike Training Club is a good option for beginners or for people who want some guidance while they try something new without having to pay for a personal trainer. I found it to be a really useful tool for learning different styles of exercise when gyms were closed due to the pandemic.

I wear an Apple Watch, so I was able to sync it with the app. I loved that I could easily mark my reps on my watch to proceed to the next exercise and that the watch would vibrate to let me know when I’d finished a timed exercise.
