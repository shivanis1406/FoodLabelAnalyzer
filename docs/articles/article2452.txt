What is kohlrabi?
Kohlrabi, also known as German turnip, is a cruciferous vegetable.
Despite its secondary name, kohlrabi is not a root vegetable and does not belong to the  turnip  family. Instead, it belongs to the  Brassica , or mustard family and is related to cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower ( 1 ).
It has long leafy stems and a round bulb that’s usually purple, pale green, or white. It’s always white-yellow on the inside ( 1 ).
The unique appearance of kohlrabi — with multiple stems growing out of the bulb — is sometimes described as alien-like.
Kohlrabi’s taste and texture are similar to those of broccoli stems and cabbage, although it’s slightly sweeter.
The bulb is widely used in salads and soups but can also be roasted or sautéed. Its leaves and stems are slightly crunchy, and you can cook them similarly to collard greens.
Kohlrabi is a cool-weather crop. It’s in season during the fall, winter, and early spring.
During colder months, you can find kohlrabi at most grocery stores, farmers markets, local food co-ops, or in  community-supported agriculture  shares.
Even outside of its peak season, kohlrabi is usually available year-round at most grocery stores. Your best chance of finding it is at large grocery stores or markets that have a wide selection of vegetables.
Kohlrabi is a cruciferous vegetable that’s closely related to cabbage. Its leaves, stems, and bulbs can be eaten raw or cooked. You can find kohlrabi at farmers markets and large grocery stores with a wide variety of veggies.

The vegetable is an excellent source of vitamin C, an antioxidant that protects your body from free radical damage and plays a role in wound healing,  collagen  synthesis, iron absorption, and immune health ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ).
Furthermore, it’s a good source of vitamin B6, which supports immune health, protein metabolism, and red blood cell production ( 7 ).
It’s also a good source of  potassium , a mineral and electrolyte that’s important for heart health and fluid balance ( 8 ,  9 ).
Finally, 1 cup (135 grams) of kohlrabi provides approximately 17% of your daily fiber needs. Dietary fiber helps support gut health and blood sugar management ( 2 ,  10 ).
One cup (135 grams) of kohlrabi provides 93% of your daily vitamin C needs. It’s also a good source of potassium, fiber, and vitamin B6.

Health benefits of kohlrabi
Kohlrabi is very nutritious and offers various health benefits.
Kohlrabi contains a wide array of antioxidants, such as  vitamin C , anthocyanins, isothiocyanates, and glucosinolates. These plant compounds protect your cells against free radical damage that may otherwise increase your risk of disease ( 1 ,  11 ).
Diets high in antioxidant-rich vegetables like kohlrabi are associated with a reduced risk of diabetes, metabolic disease, and premature death ( 12 ).
The skin of purple kohlrabi is particularly high in anthocyanins, a type of flavonoid that gives vegetables and fruit a red, purple, or blue color. A high intake of anthocyanins is linked to a  lower risk of heart disease  and may also benefit brain function ( 13 ,  14 ,  15 ).
All color varieties of kohlrabi are high in isothiocyanates and glucosinolates, which are powerful antioxidants associated with a lower risk of certain cancers, heart disease, and inflammation ( 16 ,  17 ,  18 ).
Kohlrabi is a good source of both  soluble  and insoluble fiber.
The former is water-soluble and helps maintain healthy blood sugar and cholesterol levels. On the other hand, insoluble fiber isn’t broken down in your intestine, helping add bulk to your stool and promote regular bowel movements ( 19 ).
What’s more, fiber is the main fuel source of healthy gut bacteria, such as  Bifidobacteria  and  Lactobacilli . These bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids, which nourish the cells of your gut and may protect against heart disease and obesity ( 20 ,  21 ).
Additionally, a healthy gut microbiome may be associated with a  healthier immune system  and lower risks of obesity and bowel disease ( 22 ,  23 ,  24 ).
Kohlrabi contains powerful plant compounds called glucosinolates and isothiocyanates, which are mainly found in cruciferous vegetables.
High glucosinolate intake is linked to a lower risk of heart disease due to this compound’s ability to widen blood vessels and reduce inflammation. Moreover, isothiocyanates have antioxidant properties that may  prevent plaque buildup in your arteries  ( 25 ).
A long-term study including 1,226 women ages 70 and older found that eating a diet rich in cruciferous vegetables was associated with a 13% lower risk of death from heart disease for every 10-gram  increase in fiber intake  per day ( 25 ).
Furthermore, purple kohlrabi is high in anthocyanins, which may help lower blood pressure and your risk of stroke ( 26 ,  27 ).
Finally, a high fiber diet may  protect against heart disease . One review of 15 studies found that a diet rich in this nutrient decreased the risk of death from heart disease by 24%, compared with low fiber diets ( 28 ,  29 ).
The nutrients in kohlrabi may support your immune system.
This vegetable is high in vitamin B6, which is important for many functions, including protein metabolism, red blood cell development, and immune function ( 7 ).
Vitamin B6 is involved in the production of white blood cells and T-cells, which are types of immune cells that fight foreign substances and are key to a healthy immune system. Deficiency in this nutrient is linked to a weakened immune system ( 30 ).
Additionally, kohlrabi is an excellent source of vitamin C, which may  support white blood cell function , and ultimately, strengthen your immune system ( 31 ).
Kohlrabi packs nutrients and antioxidants that may support immune health and lower your risk of chronic disease. Also, its fiber content supports a healthy gut microbiome.

How to store and cook kohlrabi
Kohlrabi may be sold with or without its stems and leaves.
If you just have the bulb, store it in a sealed bag in the fridge. If you cut off a piece of the bulb and want to store what’s left, wrap it tightly in plastic or beeswax wrap. Sliced or chopped kohlrabi pieces should be kept in an  airtight container  in the fridge.
With proper storage, both whole and cut kohlrabi bulbs should last for up to a week.
Kohlrabi that comes with its stems and leaves should also be stored in a  sealed bag  in the fridge. The stems and leaves may start to wilt within a few days, but the bulb will last longer.
If you want to use the stems and leaves, try to use them sooner than later. Stems or leaves that are a little wilted are still OK to use, but you should discard them if they are discolored or have a strange odor.
To prepare kohlrabi, start by removing the stems and leaves with a knife. Chop them up into pieces if you plan to add them to recipes.
Next, use a paring knife to peel the skin on the kohlrabi bulb. Even though it’s edible, it tends to be tough, so most people prefer to remove it.
Finally, slice the kohlrabi into pieces of your desired shape and size. You can also grate kohlrabi with a cheese grater or turn it into “noodles” with a spiralizer.
Enjoy kohlrabi raw or cooked. It can be boiled, sautéed, roasted, or grilled.
Cooked kohlrabi can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge. Depending on how it was prepared, it may last for up to a few days.
