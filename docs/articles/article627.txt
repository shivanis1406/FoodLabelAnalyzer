Title: 5 Benefits and Uses of Frankincense — and 6 Myths

Frankincense is a resin with a history in traditional medicine. It’s sometimes used to help manage arthritis, asthma, and other health conditions. But don’t believe everything you read on the packaging. Many of its health claims are unproven.
Frankincense, also known as olibanum, is made from the resin of the Boswellia tree. This tree typically grows in the dry, mountainous regions of India, Africa, and the Middle East.
Frankincense has a woody, spicy smell and can be inhaled, absorbed through the skin, or taken as a supplement.

1. Frankincense may help reduce the symptoms of arthritis
Researchers believe that frankincense  can prevent  the release of leukotrienes, compounds that can cause inflammation.
Terpenes, including boswellic acid,  appear to be  the strongest anti-inflammatory compounds in frankincense.
In  one 2014 study , oral and topical boswellic acid reduced cartilage loss and joint lining inflammation in  osteoarthritis  in mice. In humans, frankincense extract  may help reduce  symptoms of osteoarthritis and  rheumatoid arthritis .
In  one 2018 review , frankincense was consistently more effective than a placebo at reducing osteoarthritis pain and improving mobility. However, the review noted that the quality of most studies was low, and more research is needed.
In a  subsequent study , participants took 169.33 milligrams (mg) of Boswellia extract twice daily for 120 days. Results indicated that the supplement reduced inflammation, joint pain, and stiffness in mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis without serious side effects.
Another  study found  that oliban oil, another name for frankincense, reduced osteoarthritis pain when applied to the skin for 6 weeks. However, participants’ ability to do daily activities or participate in sports didn’t significantly improve.
Combinations of frankincense with other supplements may also be effective.
A  2018 study  found that 350 mg curcuminoid and 150 mg boswellic acid supplement taken 3 times per day for 12 weeks was associated with reduced osteoarthritis pain. The combination was more effective than curcumin on its own or a placebo.
Similarly, taking a combination of 5 g of methylsulfonylmethane and 7.2 mg of boswellic acids daily for 60 days was  more effective  at improving pain and function than taking  glucosamine  sulfate, a standard supplement for osteoarthritis.
For rheumatoid arthritis, researchers induced  arthritis  in rats and then treated them with 180 mg/kg of Boswellia extract. They  found that  frankincense reduced inflammation but wasn’t as effective as standard medications.

2. Frankincense may help improve gut function
One  2017 study  found that frankincense, in combination with other herbal medicines, reduced abdominal pain, bloating, and even associated depression and anxiety in people with  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) .
Another study  also indicated  that Boswellia 250 mg tablets taken daily for 6 months improved symptoms in people with IBS.
This resin appears particularly effective at reducing symptoms of  ulcerative colitis , one of the main inflammatory gut conditions.
A  study found  that Boswellia extract taken daily for 4 weeks improved symptoms in people with mild ulcerative colitis in  remission .
Boswellia extract  also had  anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in rats with  colitis .
However, most studies were small or not done in people. Therefore, more research is needed before strong conclusions can be made.

3. Frankincense may help improve the symptoms of asthma
Traditional medicine has used frankincense to treat  bronchitis  and  asthma  for centuries.
Its compounds may prevent the production of leukotrienes, which cause the bronchial muscles to constrict in asthma.
Frankincense  may also  affect Th2 cytokines, which can cause inflammation and mucus overproduction in people with asthma.
In  one small study , people who took a daily supplement of 500 mg Boswellia extract in addition to their standard asthma treatment could take fewer inhalations of their regular medications during the 4-week study.
Additionally, when researchers gave people 200 mg of a supplement made from frankincense and the South Asian fruit bael ( Aegle marmelos ),  they found  that the supplement was more effective than a placebo at reducing asthma symptoms.
In  another study , asthma symptoms in mice improved with boswellic acid, a component of frankincense resin.

4. Frankincense may help improve oral health
Frankincense may help improve  oral hygiene  and prevent  gum disease . The boswellic acids it provides  appear to have  strong antibacterial properties, which may help prevent and treat oral infections.
In  one test-tube study , frankincense extract was effective against  Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, which  causes aggressive gum disease.
In  another very small study , participants chewed gum containing frankincense for 5 hours, with saliva samples indicating reduced numbers of microbes each hour. The authors suggested that frankincense may decrease sources of infection in the mouth.
However, more research is needed on the effect of frankincense on oral health.

5. Frankincense may have anticancer properties
Test-tube  studies suggest  that the boswellic acids it contains  might prevent  cancer cells from spreading.
A  research review  notes that boswellic acids may also prevent DNA formation in cancerous cells, which could help limit  cancer  growth.
So far, test-tube studies suggest that frankincense may fight breast,  prostate ,  pancreatic ,  skin , and  colon  cancer cells. It may also help reduce side effects of cancer treatment.
In  one study  of people being treated for  brain tumors , 4,500 mg of boswellic acid extract taken each day helped reduce  brain edema  — an accumulation of fluid in the brain — while also lowering participants’ regular medication dose.
However, more research in humans is needed.

Common myths about frankincense
Although frankincense is praised for multiple health benefits, not all are backed by science. The following claims have very little evidence behind them.
Yet, while very little research exists to support these claims, very little exists to deny them, either. Until more studies are done, however, these claims should be considered myths.
Some small studies  report that  frankincense may help  lower blood sugar levels  in people with diabetes, and a  recent research review  also indicated that frankincense may help control diabetes.
Still, other studies have found no effect, and more research is needed.
Frankincense may help lower  depressive and anxious  behaviors and  reduce stress  in rats. However, human studies are needed.
Frankincense has anti-inflammatory effects that  could help  reduce the inflammation common in heart disease. Some research  has suggested  heart-protective effects from frankincense, but more studies are needed.
Studies  show that  large doses of frankincense  may help  boost memory in rats. However, more research needs to be done in humans.
Frankincense is said to  delay menopause  and reduce menstrual cramping, nausea, headaches, and mood shifts.
One study  found that some essential oils increased the amount of estrogen in women’s saliva, which could be linked to reduced menopause symptoms.
However, frankincense was not found to have this effect, and research is needed to confirm any benefits of frankincense on menopause.
Frankincense supplements  may increase  fertility in rats, but few studies are available.

How to use frankincense
Frankincense can be used in several ways. You can take it as an oral  supplement  in a capsule or tablet or use it in topical creams.
It’s also available as an  essential oil  for  aromatherapy  or topical use. It’s important to dilute this form with  carrier oil  before applying it to the skin and to avoid ingesting it.
Frankincense is generally safe, but as with any supplement, it’s important to consult a healthcare professional before taking it.

Effective frankincense dosage
The optimal dosage of frankincense is not well understood and may vary by person or condition.
If you’re considering supplementing with frankincense, ask a healthcare professional about a recommended dosage.

Possible side effects of frankincense
Frankincense is considered safe for most people. It has been a remedy for  thousands of years  without severe side effects, and the resin has a low toxicity.
One study  found that doses up to 1,000 mg/kg were not toxic in rats. This is equivalent to almost five times the typical maximum daily dose of 1,500 mg for humans.
Still, more research is needed on toxic doses of frankincense in people.
Side effects  reported  in scientific studies have included indigestion, constipation, and nausea.
Some research reports that frankincense  may increase  the risk of  miscarriage , so pregnant people or those trying to become pregnant may want to avoid it.
Frankincense  may also interact  with some medications,  particularly  blood thinners like warfarin and possibly nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen.
If you’re taking any of these medications, discuss frankincense with your doctor before using it.
The French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) cautioned in a  2020 report  that some supplements, including frankincense, may interfere with the body’s inflammatory response during a  COVID-19 infection .
On the other hand, some research  has suggested  that frankincense  may be  an effective complementary therapy for COVID-19  due to  its anti-inflammatory properties.
More research is needed on its safety, effectiveness, and reactions to other medications.
