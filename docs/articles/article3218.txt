How it works
MealPro is a service that delivers healthy, freshly prepared meals that are rich in protein and  complex carbs .
Meals can be customized with extra portions of protein, carbs, or vegetables, depending on your specific dietary needs and preferences.
You can also order certain ingredients by weight to help simplify your weekly meal prep routine.
All dishes arrive fully prepared and can be refrigerated or frozen, reheated, and served for a nutritious and effortless meal.

Meal selection
Unlike other meal delivery services, MealPro doesn’t offer any specific plans or programs catered to specific diets.
Instead, the service allows you to select your favorite dishes from its rotating weekly menu to completely customize your order.
You can choose either 18 or 21 meals per box and opt for an extra serving of protein or carbs, or no carbs with an extra serving of vegetables.
A few examples of meals that MealPro offers include:
beef teriyaki
turkey casserole
shrimp  stir-fry
skillet meatballs
The nutritional content of each meal is available on the company’s menu, making it easy to find choices that fit your dietary needs and preferences.
You can also order food in bulk by weight, including certain types of meat, fish, poultry, and vegetables.

Ingredients
According to MealPro, all meals contain natural ingredients and are prepared using cooking methods that maximize nutrient retention.
Meals also feature seasonal vegetables, organic brown rice, hormone-free chicken,  wild-caught salmon , and red meat from Niman Ranch, whose network of farmers produces sustainable, humanely raised livestock.
Each dish on the menu also includes a full list of ingredients, which can be useful for those who prefer to limit or exclude certain ingredients from their diet.

Taste and freshness
MealPro uses fresh, seasonal ingredients with a variety of herbs,  spices , and seasonings to maximize flavor.
The menu also rotates regularly with new options to add plenty of diversity to your diet.
Additionally, meals are vacuum-sealed and packaged with thermal liners and dry ice to ensure that they arrive fresh.

Diet friendliness
MealPro offers options suitable for several diet patterns, including  high protein , low sodium, pescatarian, dairy-free, soy-free, and paleo diets.
You can also customize certain dishes to decrease their carb content. This feature can be beneficial for those following a low carb or ketogenic diet.
Additionally, the service offers numerous gluten-free options for those with celiac disease or a gluten sensitivity.
Some of the meals on MealPro’s menu feature  common allergens  like shrimp or dairy, but according to the company’s website, cooking surfaces are thoroughly cleaned each time a new ingredient is prepared to prevent cross contamination.
Plus, the company uses designated color-coded utensils and cutting boards for different food items.
Furthermore, potential allergens are identified directly on the menu for those who are allergic to specific ingredients.
However, because there are limited meatless options on the menu, MealPro may not be suitable for vegans, vegetarians, or those looking to decrease their intake of meat, fish, and poultry.

Weight loss
Although MealPro is not specifically designed to  promote weight loss , it may be useful for those looking to lose weight and increase muscle growth.
In fact, most meals are high in protein and provide 400–700 calories per serving.
Consuming fewer calories than you burn throughout the day can create a calorie deficit, which can lead to weight loss ( 1 ).
Additionally, increasing your intake of protein can support feelings of fullness and appetite control, helping keep you feeling fuller for longer between meals ( 2 ).
What’s more, one study found that following a high protein diet significantly increased the number of calories burned throughout the day, compared with a low protein diet ( 3 ).
Protein is also important for tissue repair and muscle growth and can help improve body composition when paired with resistance training ( 4 ).

Price
Because MealPro dishes are purchased à la carte, the prices can vary depending on what you order.
However, most preportioned meals on the menu typically cost $8.99–$13.99 per serving.
The price also increases if you make any modifications to your meal, such as opting for an extra serving of protein or carbs.
You can also order certain foods by weight, and prices for this option range from $8.99–$15.99 per pound (0.5 kg).
Shipping is applied at checkout and determined by your location and the number of meals that you select.

Comparison with competitors
Several programs are similar to MealPro, providing freshly prepared, high protein meals directly to your door.
For instance, Trifecta Nutrition is a meal delivery service tailored to athletes. It offers plans for a variety of diets, including classic, ketogenic, vegan, vegetarian, and  paleo diets .
While Trifecta Nutrition allows you to add up to two preferences when placing your order, most plans are chef’s choice, meaning that you can’t customize your weekly menu like you can with MealPro.
Trifecta Nutrition is also a bit more expensive, with plans starting at around $13.79 per serving.
However, Trifecta Nutrition uses only high quality, organic ingredients sourced from local suppliers who prioritize sustainability, which may be worth the higher price point for some.
Factor is another delivery service that offers high protein, chef-prepared dishes that are ready to enjoy in minutes.
You can select your choice of meals from the company’s full menu and filter dishes to find options that are suitable for specific eating patterns, including low calorie, ketogenic,  low carb , vegetarian, and paleo diets.
Factor starts at just $11 per serving and also offers breakfast dishes and other products, including juices, wellness shots, and snacks.
However, while Factor has a more extensive menu, it doesn’t currently allow you to make modifications to dishes like MealPro does, such as increasing the portion sizes for protein, carbs, or vegetables.

The bottom line
MealPro makes it easy to enjoy healthy, high protein dishes at home, with no cooking or cleanup required.
Because it allows you to customize your weekly menu and make modifications to certain dishes, it may be a great option for those following certain diets who are hoping to save time on cooking.
It also includes many options that are high in protein and low in calories, which could be a good choice for people who are looking to lose weight.
However, it offers limited selections for  vegans and vegetarians  and uses mostly conventional produce instead of organic, which may not make it a great fit for everyone.
