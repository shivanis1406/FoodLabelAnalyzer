You may have heard magnesium plays an important role in several bodily functions, including muscle contraction and regulating blood pressure and blood sugar.
While it’s found in many foods, including vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and beans, if you don’t consume enough of these foods regularly you might not be meeting the recommended daily amount of magnesium.
But you might be looking to supplement to help with:
improving sleep
anxiety levels
muscle cramps
constipation
Selecting the most suitable form of magnesium, as well as the appropriate dosage, is an essential step in choosing the right product for you.

Healthline’s picks for the best magnesium supplements

Best for sleep
Form   powder
Dose   1 scoop (3.95 g) per day
Certifications   NSF Certified for Sport
Price   $$$

We chose Thorne as the best magnesium supplement for sleep because of its high quality ingredients, third-party certification, and inclusion of bisglycinate, a form of magnesium glycinate that may be better absorbed.
Research from 2022  suggests that taking magnesium before bed may help improve sleep quality, especially for adults with  insomnia .
Magnesium glycinate is a form of magnesium that’s created by combining magnesium with the amino acid glycine, which has been shown to have a  calming effect  on the brain. Because of this, it’s thought that it could be beneficial for sleep, though studies are needed to confirm its effectiveness in humans.
Note that research on the benefits of magnesium glycinate for sleep is ongoing. But if you’re interested in trying it, Thorne Magnesium Bisglycinate Powder is our top pick.
The powder is sweetened with  monk fruit concentrate  and is free from added sugars, thickeners, artificial flavors and colors
Plus, it gets good reviews for its flavor and ease of use.
Thorne products are made in a lab that meets quality and safety standards set by NSF International and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), a regulatory body in Australia responsible for assessing supplements.

Moreover, this supplement is  NSF Certified for Sport , a third-party certification that ensures products are free from more than 200 substances banned by many major sports organizations.

Best for muscle cramps
Form   tablet
Dose   1 tablet per day
Certifications   non-GMO verified, certified vegan, certified gluten-free
Price   $$

We selected this as the best magnesium supplement for muscle cramps because it contains three forms of magnesium—glycinate, citrate, and malate—and is commonly praised for its ability to reduce cramps based on anecdotal evidence.

Magnesium has been shown to play an important role in  helping your muscles relax . That’s why insufficient magnesium intake is thought to cause some  muscle cramps .

While the research is inconclusive,  some individuals  report  muscle cramp relief  from taking magnesium.

Unlike many other supplements, this one can be taken on an empty stomach. As a result, you can easily take it just before bed and it may help keep nighttime cramps at bay.

Best for anxiety

Price   $

SFI Health (previously Klaire Labs) Magnesium Glycinate Complex is our choice for the best magnesium supplement for anxiety because it’s highly rated online and contains a blend of chelated  magnesium glycinate  and magnesium oxide, both of which may help manage anxiety.
While magnesium glycinate is commonly used to help with sleep and anxiety,  magnesium oxide  is one of the most common forms tested in studies examining anxiety, though more research on magnesium for anxiety overall is still needed.
In addition to being formulated for maximum absorption, we like that this supplement only requires one capsule per day and is free from artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives.
According to the company’s website, SFI Health supplements are tested multiple times throughout manufacturing. However, it’s unclear whether testing is done in-house or by third-party labs.

If you’ve been diagnosed with a  magnesium deficiency , Trace Mineral Mega Mag is worth considering.
The liquid supplement provides 95% of the DV of magnesium in the form of  magnesium chloride  — a form that’s  often used  to address low blood levels of magnesium.
This supplement comes in a convenient liquid form and is free from artificial ingredients and added sugars.
Trace Minerals supplements are third-party tested for purity and potency, and this product specifically is  certified by Labdoor , an independent testing organization that confirms label accuracy.

Migraine is a neurological condition that can cause painful episodes of head pain, also known as  migraine episodes . They’re often associated with  symptoms  like nausea, weakness, and sensitivity to light and sound.
Research  from 2022 indicates that magnesium supplements may help prevent and manage migraine episodes. Magnesium oxide is one form of magnesium that’s thought to be effective for migraine, though more research is needed.
Still, if you’re looking for a way to help manage recurring migraine episodes, it’s worth considering Douglas Laboratories  Magnesium Oxide .
While this product is not routinely third-party tested for purity and potency, Douglas Laboratories tests all products in-house at ISO certified facilities.
It’s worth noting that some reviewers mention diarrhea as a side effect of the supplement. This is sometimes seen with  magnesium oxide , specifically.

Magnesium supplements, particularly  magnesium citrate , sulfite, hydroxide, and oxide, are thought to be an  effective treatment  for occasional constipation.

These work by an osmotic laxative effect, which means they draw water into the intestines, softening stool and making it easier to pass.

Pure Encapsulations Magnesium Citrate is in a facility that’s NSF registered and CGMP certified, this supplement is also vegan, non-GMO verified, and certified  gluten-free  by the Gluten-Free Certification Organization.

In comparison to other magnesium supplements, this product has a lower dose of magnesium citrate, which can help move things along without causing an urgent trip to the bathroom.

For best results, take a single pill with a meal, one to four times a day, depending on recommendations from a healthcare professional.

Dose   1 tsp (4g)
Certifications    none
Price   $$$

Women-founded company, Moon Juice, offers a magnesium powder that combines 3 forms of magnesium designed to support muscle relaxation, mental calm, and regular bowel movements.

The supplement includes a blend of magnesium citrate, which may help prevent constipation, along with magnesium gluconate and acetyl taurinate, though there is limited research on the specific benefits of these two forms. Since it’s a proprietary blend, the exact amounts of each type of magnesium aren’t disclosed.

It also contains L-theanine, which  some research  suggests may help reduce stress and anxiety, though more research is needed. The product provides 112 mg of L-theanine, while studies typically show benefits at doses of 200–400 mg.

The gluten-free powder is available in berry, blue lemon, or unflavored varieties, and is both vegan and keto-friendly, naturally sweetened with monk fruit.

According to the website, Magnesi-Om is third-party tested, though the testing organization is not disclosed.

A comparison of the best magnesium supplements

How we chose
Healthline’s dietitians evaluated the best magnesium supplements based on the following criteria:
Ingredients:  We looked for products that are made from high quality ingredients and free from artificial colors and preservatives.
Intended use:  We included products made to address specific needs such as migraine, constipation, leg cramps, and sleep problems.
Type of magnesium:  The supplements on our list contain forms of magnesium that research shows are effective for each product’s intended use.
Vetting:  All the products included have been vetted to ensure that they meet Healthline’s medical and business standards.

How to choose a magnesium supplement
When shopping for a magnesium supplement, it’s important to consider which form of magnesium is right for your needs, the form of supplement you’re comfortable taking, how much magnesium you need to take, and whether the supplement is tested to confirm label accuracy.
Magnesium comes in  several forms  that differ in their specific uses and absorbability. Magnesium supplements either use single-form magnesium or blends of different types for specific uses and benefits.
While some research exists for the various types of magnesium, most still required more in-depth research.
Magnesium glycinate:  may help improve  symptoms of anxiety and depression . It may also be helpful for sleep.
Magnesium citrate:  raises magnesium levels in the body. It may be  better absorbed  than other types and can help  relieve constipation .
Magnesium chloride:  may help  relieve digestive complaints  like constipation and heartburn and can help replenish magnesium levels in the body
Magnesium sulfate:  also known as  Epsom salt  and often used in bathwater to help relieve muscle tension
Magnesium oxide:  may help  relieve migraine symptoms  and  depression and anxiety . It may also be helpful for  restless leg syndrome
Magnesium malate:  helps improve magnesium levels in the body and may be useful in  treating fibromyalgia
Magnesium lactate:  may help improve magnesium levels in the body and  reduce stress levels
It’s important to choose a supplement that you’re comfortable taking on a daily basis. For example, if you dislike swallowing pills, you may want to opt for a liquid, gummy, or chewable option instead.
Even if you are OK with capsules, it’s worth reading customer reviews to understand how large the capsules are and whether they’re easy to swallow.
Lastly, consider if you’re OK taking multiple pills per day, or if you’d prefer a one-a-day formulation.
The  recommended dose  for magnesium supplements varies  depending on :
the Recommended Dietary Allowance for your age and gender
how much magnesium you consume through your diet
whether you have a condition that makes it difficult for your body to absorb magnesium or that requires more magnesium
In addition to recommended amounts, there are also established Tolerable Upper Intake Levels for magnesium specifically from supplements.
To avoid potential side effects, such as diarrhea,  nausea , and stomach cramps, try to keep your intake of magnesium from supplements under 350 mg per day, unless a healthcare professional has advised you otherwise.
Here are the current average daily  recommended amounts  of magnesium for teens and adults:
Given that the FDA doesn’t regulate supplements the same way as drugs, it’s best to look for brands that are tested, ideally by a third-party organization such as:
NSF International
Labdoor
UL Solutions
USP
This will help ensure that the contents of the bottle match what’s listed on the label.

Research on magnesium supplements does not generally specify gender as a determining factor for choosing a specific form of magnesium. There isn’t a clear best magnesium supplement for women.
Instead, the choice often depends on individual health needs and preferences. Various forms of magnesium can benefit both men and women. Consulting with a healthcare professional can help you determine the most suitable magnesium supplement for you.

There is no specific type of magnesium supplement that is universally considered the best for weight loss.
While some studies suggest that magnesium may indirectly support weight management by  helping regulate blood sugar  and metabolism, it’s not a standalone solution for weight loss.
Also,  research  does suggest that many diet plans end up being low in several minerals, including magnesium. So supplementing while on a diet may be beneficial, though you should run it by a doctor first.
Individuals looking to incorporate magnesium into their weight loss regimen should consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

While there’s no official best magnesium for fatigue, a  deficiency  in magnesium can cause fatigue. Certain forms, such as magnesium malate and lactate, are known for improving levels in the body, and may be most useful for fighting fatigue associated with a deficiency.
That being said, if you’re regularly experiencing fatigue, it’s a good idea to chat with your doctor to be sure there aren’t any other underlying causes.

The bottom line
Magnesium is an essential nutrient found in a variety of whole foods. However, some people may need help getting enough magnesium on a daily basis.
Supplements may be a good option for people who don’t meet their needs through diet alone, or for those with specific health concerns, such as anxiety, occasional constipation, migraine, and trouble sleeping.
Because the FDA doesn’t regulate supplements the same way that it regulates medications, it’s important to choose reputable brands that have undergone quality testing. To make your decision simpler, you can select a product from the list above.
If you’re unsure how much to take or which type is most appropriate for your needs, you can speak with a healthcare professional for a specific recommendation.
