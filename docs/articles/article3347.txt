What is Paleo on the Go?
Paleo on the Go is a  frozen meal delivery service  that offers meals for various strict dietary patterns, including:
Paleo.  This diet aims to mimic what prehistoric hunter-gatherers may have eaten. It’s free of gluten, dairy, soy, legumes, seed oils, and most added sugars and refined additives ( 1 ).
Autoimmune protocol (AIP).  This elimination diet is designed to help reduce autoimmune symptoms. Its elimination phase is extremely strict, following paleo guidelines and excluding nightshade vegetables, eggs, nuts, seeds, alcohol, and coffee ( 2 ).
Whole30.  This 30-day elimination-style diet removes added sugars, alcohol, grains, gluten, legumes, soy, dairy, carrageenan, monosodium glutamate (MSG), sulfites, and baked goods or junk foods — even if they’re made with Whole30-friendly ingredients.
Keto.  Keto is a low carb, high fat, moderate protein diet that many people use to help with weight loss, blood sugar management, or epilepsy ( 3 ).
As you can see, many of these diets focus exclusively on whole-food ingredients. It’s rare for meal delivery services to offer meals that are compliant with these stringent dietary needs.
With Paleo on the Go, a membership isn’t required, but there’s a “subscribe and save” option to save you some money if you order regularly.

Menu and meal plan options
Paleo on the Go provides a variety of à la carte options if you prefer total control over which foods you receive. However, the company also offers several starter packs and bundles based on specific dietary needs, personal preferences, and seasonal meals.
For example, available bundles include the Sweet Tooth Bundle, Whole30-Approved Soup Bundle, Keto Sampler, and AIP Starter Pack.
Available à la carte menu items include:
homemade chicken pot pie
beef short ribs with mushroom gravy and  cauliflower  “polenta”
spinach and mushroom beef lasagna
moo shu pork taco kit
house burger with tamarind ketchup, garlic dill pickles, and roasted sweet potatoes
Paleo on the Go also offers several dessert options, like strawberry vanilla cake, apple cinnamon paleo tarts, carob chunk cookies, and raspberry cheesecake with kiwi sauce.

Ingredients and food quality
Paleo on the Go is extremely stringent regarding food quality and ingredient sourcing.
All meals are completely free of dairy, gluten, soy, legumes, and seed oils like canola, peanut, or soybean oil.
The company uses organic ingredients when possible but follows the Environmental Working Group’s  Dirty Dozen  and Clean Fifteen guidelines to decide which produce must be organic ( 4 ,  5 ).
Foods on the Dirty Dozen list are purchased organic, but foods on the  Clean Fifteen  list may be conventionally grown ( 4 ,  5 ).
Meats must be humanely raised and free of antibiotics and hormones. Beef and lamb are grass-fed and grass-finished, and seafood is all wild-caught or organic.
The Paleo on the Go website has a  detailed page  about their ingredient sourcing guidelines, including the farms from which they purchase all of their meats.

Pricing
Unlike many other meal delivery services, Paleo on the Go isn’t subscription based. Therefore, pricing varies depending on which items you purchase.
The best way to save money on Paleo on the Go is by utilizing the “subscribe and save” option and ordering bundles or samplers rather than à la carte meals.
For example, the Keto Sampler provides 8 servings for $125, or $15.62 per serving. You can subscribe to save 5%, which would reduce the cost to $14.84 per serving. Comparatively, many of these items cost $17 or more per serving if they’re purchased à la carte.
Paleo on the Go also has a rewards program that can help you save money on regular purchases. You can earn 2 points for every $1 you spend and redeem 100 points to save $1 on future purchases.
You can also earn points for things like following the company on social media or referring friends.
Note that there’s a minimum order size of $99, and shipping costs can vary based on your location and the shipping demand.

Delivery
Paleo on the Go delivers anywhere in the United States, except for Hawaii and Alaska. The company is unable to deliver to post office boxes at this time.
The service partners with FedEx for shipping and offers additional delivery protections through a service called Route. For about $5 per order, you can add Route+ to protect lost, stolen, or damaged shipments.
The cost of FedEx shipping varies depending on how much you order and the delivery location. At the time of this writing, 2-day shipping is about $35, while 1-day shipping is about $75.
If you’re near the Tampa Bay, Florida area, you can pick up your order for free at the Paleo on the Go headquarters.

Pros
The most obvious benefit of Paleo on the Go is that it fills a gap in the meal delivery space. Few other meal delivery services cater strictly to paleo and similar diets like  AIP  and Whole30.
Paleo on the Go offers convenience for people following these diets, when otherwise their options are severely limited, as most restaurants don’t cater to these dietary needs.
Additionally, Paleo on the Go doesn’t lock you into a membership or subscription. For short-term elimination diets like  Whole30 , this is ideal.
Paleo on the Go also offers a variety of menu items, including desserts — rather than just lunch and dinner meals as many other services.

Cons
Paleo on the Go is expensive, with prices around $15 or more per serving. These prices are comparable to those at some restaurants. Plus, the shipping fee is an additional expense on each order.
However, it may be worth the cost for those who value the convenience and need to follow a strict  paleo diet  for their health. Also, the “subscribe and save” option and rewards program can help regular customers save money.

Is it recommended?
Paleo on the Go is an excellent option if you’re following a stricter dietary approach like paleo, AIP, or Whole30.
Although it’s more expensive than other meal delivery services, few of them cater to these dietary needs.
Paleo on the Go offers a convenient and time-saving alternative to cooking all of your meals from scratch, as many people following these strict diets often must do.

The bottom line
Paleo on the Go is a frozen meal delivery service offering paleo, AIP, Whole30, and  keto  meal options — all of which are free of dairy, soy, gluten, legumes, and seed oils.
The ingredients are of high quality, and the service’s high price is a reflection of this. However, Paleo on the Go provides a convenient meal option for people following these diets. Otherwise, they’d have to cook all of their meals from scratch.
