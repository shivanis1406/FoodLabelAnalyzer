Zepbound is a newer weight loss medication joining the ranks of  Rybelsus  and  Saxenda . It’s a brand name for tirzepatide, which manufacturers also sell as a drug for type 2 diabetes under the name Mounjaro.
Unlike others in its class, tirzepatide targets two hormones — glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). This double action makes it particularly effective at supporting weight loss with exercise and a balanced diet.
If you’re living with overweight or obesity and are interested in  exploring Zepbound  as a treatment option, consulting a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation is crucial.
However, several verified options have passed our rigorous vetting standards for those who prefer the convenience of getting Zepbound online.

Zepbound news: The latest on GLP-1 weight loss medications
Eli Lilly officials announced a new program   to  make weight-loss medications more affordable . It provides  single-dose vials of Zepbound at a 50% discount  to some consumers.
Based on a new study, individuals living with type two diabetes who were treated with GLP-1s were found to be at a  reduced risk for 10 obesity-associated cancers .
A study  at University of Oxford  looked at whether semaglutide may contribute to neurological problems. Researchers actually found that  users of semaglutide had a lower risk for dementia .
Due to its growing popularity and  supply chain issues , Zepbound may sometimes be in short supply, and your healthcare professional may recommend an  alternative .
Finally, because of  concerns around safety , the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t approve and warns against consuming  compounded  versions of injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist medications, including tirzepatide and semaglutide. It’s important to talk with a healthcare professional to ensure you’re receiving non-compounded, FDA-approved GLP-1 medications.

Can I buy Zepbound online?
Yes, you can buy Zepbound online, but you’ll need a valid prescription from a healthcare professional, such as your primary care physician, a physician assistant, or a nurse practitioner, depending on your state’s regulations.
It’s usually best to consult with a weight management specialist, who can determine whether Zepbound is a suitable medication for you based on your health profile and weight management goals.
If you plan on buying Zepbound online, only do so from licensed and regulated platforms that supply safe and legitimate medications. The five services above are the ones we recommend after thorough vetting.
Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We evaluate services for consistency with standards of care and best practices, and we look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the services on this page, we considered all the GLP-1 services that passed our vetting process. Then, we looked at availability, cost, and the additional resources each service provides to narrow down our list even further.

An expert’s take on obtaining Zepbound online
Healthline asked  Janelle Duah , MD, assistant professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine, about considerations people can have if they choose to work with any online professionals.
In addition to confirming the professional’s credentials, Duah recommended, “[Individuals] should make sure guidelines are quite clear regarding their care, including how often they will have appointments, if they provide lifestyle counseling in addition to the use of medications, how much the medication will cost, how long they will have to take the medication, and from where the medication will come.
“They should also make sure that there is good follow-up and accountability with the provider with whom they are working, and that there isn’t just a plan for weight loss but also for maintenance.”

Considerations for buying Zepbound online
If you’re considering buying Zepbound online, it’s important to prioritize your health and safety and do your due diligence. Here are some considerations:
Legitimacy:  Choose online pharmacies or platforms with an established reputation. Read customer feedback and reviews to investigate the platform’s history and credibility.
Authenticity:  Counterfeit medication may be ineffective or harmful, so it’s critical to use authentic, regulated versions only. Buy from a reputable source and check for verification seals, batch numbers, and expiration dates on the packaging. If prices are suspiciously low, question the origin of the medication.
Privacy and security measures:  Opt for platforms that safeguard your personal and financial details and provide policies outlining how they handle and protect this data. Check for secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption and trustworthy payment methods.

Pros and cons of buying Zepbound online
Convenience:  You can shop from the comfort of your home at any time. There’s no need to travel or wait in line.
Discretion:  The experience offers privacy for those who prefer to keep their health matters personal.
Price comparison:  It’s easy to compare prices across different websites to find the best deal.
Access to information:  Online platforms often provide detailed product information and resources.
Wider availability:  The platforms can be helpful for people living in areas where Zepbound might not be readily available in local pharmacies.
Risk of counterfeits:  There can be a higher chance of encountering fake or substandard medications.
Regulatory concerns:  Not all online pharmacies comply with legal and safety standards.
Prescription verification:  Some websites might bypass the requirement for a valid prescription, which may cause harm.
Shipping times:  These can lead to delays, potentially interrupting treatment continuity.
Lack of personal interaction:  No direct advice and support are available from pharmacists or healthcare professionals.
Payment security:  The risks associated with online payment can include fraud and data breaches.

About Zepbound
Zepbound  is a weekly injectable prescription  weight loss  medication with the active ingredient tirzepatide. It’s a  GLP-1 agonist  drug that  slows stomach emptying , meaning you feel fuller for longer. It also reduces  glucagon  secretion, a key hormone in blood sugar and appetite regulation.
Unlike other medications in its class, Zepbound also activates GIP, another appetite-regulating hormone.
Healthcare professionals may recommend Zepbound for long-term weight management in adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kilograms per square meter (kg/m²) or greater (obesity). Doctors may also prescribe it for those with a BMI of 27 kg/m² or greater (overweight) and at least one weight-related health condition, like high blood pressure.

Frequently asked questions
Ozempic and Zepbound aren’t the same, but they do belong to the same family of medications: GLP-1 receptor agonists.
Ozempic  is a brand name for the medication semaglutide. It’s FDA approved for treating type 2 diabetes by improving blood sugar levels. Licensed healthcare professionals may also prescribe it off-label for weight loss and recommend eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly.
Semaglutide is also available under the brand name Wegovy for weight loss.
Zepbound is a newer medication that’s specifically approved for weight loss. It has a distinct mechanism of action: Not only is it a GLP-1 receptor agonist, but it also activates GIP receptors. This dual action can make it an effective option for weight management.

While more research is necessary, Duah said that Zepbound (tirzepatide) may be more effective than  Wegovy  (semaglutide) or  Saxenda  (liraglutide) for weight loss.
A comprehensive  2024 research review  examined 76 clinical trials of 15 GLP-1 receptor agonist medications. Researchers identified tirzepatide as the standout for managing blood sugar levels and ranked it as the second most effective for weight loss.
Tirzepatide trailed only behind CagriSema, a combination of semaglutide and cagrilintide yet to be released.

At time of publishing, Mounjaro, which contains the same active ingredient as Zepbound, is listed as having limited availability on the  FDA’s database .
If you’re concerned about the current status of tirzepatide supply, it’s best to check the most recent updates from Eli Lilly, pharmacies, the FDA, or other official health advisories.

The bottom line
While getting Zepbound through an in-person consultation with a healthcare professional is a good idea, several reliable and licensed online weight loss platforms are also worth considering.
Many of these programs offer comprehensive support and coaching to help you reach your goals. However, it’s crucial to use trustworthy sources that include a thorough medical assessment as part of the process.
Finally, remember that while effective, Zepbound has a high price point, and there’s a  risk of regaining  any weight you may have lost once you stop taking it. For these reasons, talking with your doctor or registered dietitian about the right weight loss option is important.
