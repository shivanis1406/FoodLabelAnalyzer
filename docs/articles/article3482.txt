They’re similar in their nutrient contents but also have some slight differences.
Plus, there are some downsides to consider.
This article reviews the similarities and differences between Red Bull and Monster, as well as the drawbacks of consuming energy drinks.

What are Red Bull and Monster?
Red Bull and Monster are two of the best-known energy drink brands.
Energy drinks are carbonated beverages that contain caffeine, as well as other energy-boosting compounds, such as taurine and  guarana  ( 1 ).
They’re widely used as an alternative to other caffeinated drinks like coffee to provide an energy boost throughout the day.
Red Bull and Monster are similar in many ways but have slightly different ingredients and flavor profiles.
Red Bull and Monster are two popular energy drinks, which are caffeinated, carbonated beverages that may also contain other energy-boosting compounds.

Nutritional comparison
Red Bull and Monster are nearly identical in terms of nutrition, providing the following per 8-ounce (240-ml) serving ( 2 ,  3 ):
The two brands are fairly equal in  calories , protein, carbs, and caffeine, with each 8-ounce (240-ml) serving containing slightly less caffeine than the same amount of coffee ( 4 ).
They’re also full of added sugars, which make up the vast majority of their carb contents.
Both energy drinks are also high in  B vitamins , which are added during processing and play important roles in energy production ( 5 ).
Red Bull and Monster are very similar in terms of calories, carbs, protein, and caffeine. They’re high in sugar but also contain large amounts of B vitamins.

Similarities and differences
Red Bull and Monster share similar nutrient contents but differ slightly in their ingredients and flavor.
Red Bull contains caffeine,  taurine , B vitamins, and sugar — all of which may provide a short-term energy boost ( 1 ,  5 ).
Monster contains these ingredients as well but adds guarana,  ginseng  root, and L-carnitine, which may also increase energy levels ( 1 ,  6 ,  7 ).
Moreover, while Red Bull is often sold in single-serving, 8-ounce (240-ml) cans, Monster is usually available in 16-ounce (480-ml) cans, which contain 2 servings.
Most people drink the entire can in one sitting, no matter how many servings it contains. Therefore, drinking 16 ounces (480 ml) of Monster would provide twice the calories, sugar, and caffeine than drinking 8 ounces (240 ml) of Red Bull ( 8 ).
Red Bull and Monster are very similar. Monster contains some additional energy-boosting ingredients and typically comes in a larger can that contains two, 8-ounce (240-ml) servings.

Downsides of energy drinks
Energy drinks, such as Red Bull and Monster, have certain drawbacks that should be carefully considered before you decide to drink them regularly.
An 8-ounce (240-ml) serving of Red Bull or Monster provides only slightly less caffeine than the same amount of coffee.
Up to 400 mg of caffeine per day is generally safe. Still, drinking more than four, 8-ounce (240-ml) servings of energy drinks per day — or two, 16-ounce (480-ml) cans of Monster — may cause negative effects due to  excess caffeine , such as headache or insomnia ( 9 ,  10 ).
In addition, more research is needed to fully understand the risks and benefits of consuming large amounts of some of the other energy-boosting components in energy drinks, such as taurine ( 11 ).
Particularly in younger people, excessive energy drink intake has been linked to abnormal heart rhythm, heart attack, and — in some rare cases — death ( 1 ,  12 ,  13 ).
Energy drinks are also  high in sugar , which is associated with obesity, dental problems, and type 2 diabetes. For optimal health, added sugars, such as those in energy drinks, should be limited to no more than 5% of your daily calorie intake ( 14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 ).
According to the Red Bull website, a classic 8.4-ounce (248-ml) can of Red Bull contains 27 grams of sugar. This equates to nearly 7 teaspoons of sugar.
Monster contains 28 grams of sugar per 8.4-ounce (248-ml) can, which is comparable to Red Bull. Drinking just one of these energy drinks daily can cause you to consume too much added sugar, which is bad for your overall health ( 2 ).
Because of these downsides, children, pregnant women, and those with heart problems or sensitivities to caffeine should avoid energy drinks.
In fact, most people should avoid these beverages or limit their intake. Instead, try to consider healthier alternatives like coffee or tea to  boost your energy levels .
Energy drinks are full of sugar, and excessive energy drink consumption may lead to problems from excessive caffeine intake. Children, pregnant women, those with heart problems, and caffeine-sensitive people should avoid these beverages.

The bottom line
Red Bull and Monster are two popular  energy drinks  that are similar in terms of their nutrient content but differ slightly in taste and ingredients.
Both are high in sugar and contain caffeine, as well as other energy-boosting compounds.
For optimal health, energy drinks should be strictly limited in your diet.
Pregnant women, children, people with heart problems, and caffeine-sensitive individuals should avoid them entirely.
