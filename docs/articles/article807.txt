Title: What Is Tamarind? A Tropical Fruit with Health Benefits

Tamarind is a fruit that contains a nutrient-rich, fibrous pulp. Its nutrients may have antioxidant, anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, and anti-viral effects, among other benefits.
Tamarind is a type of tropical fruit used in many dishes around the world.
It may even have medicinal properties.
This article tells you everything you need to know about tamarind, including what it is, how it may benefit health, whether it has any risks, and how to use it.

What is tamarind?
Tamarind is a hardwood tree, known scientifically as  Tamarindus indica .
It’s native to Africa but also grows in India, Pakistan, and many other tropical regions.
The tree produces bean-like pods filled with seeds surrounded by a fibrous pulp.
The pulp of the young fruit is green and sour. As it ripens, the juicy pulp becomes paste-like and more sweet-sour.
Interestingly, tamarind is sometimes referred to as the “date of India.”
Tamarind is a tropical tree that grows in several regions around the world. It produces pods filled with paste-like, sweet-sour fruit.

How is it used?
This  fruit  has many uses, including cooking, health, and household purposes.
Tamarind pulp is widely used for cooking in South and Southeast Asia, Mexico, the Middle East, and the Caribbean. The seeds and leaves are also edible.
It is used in sauces, marinades, chutneys, drinks, and desserts. It’s also one of the ingredients of Worcestershire sauce.
Tamarind has played an important role in traditional medicine.
In beverage form, it was commonly used to treat diarrhea, constipation, fever, and malaria. The bark and leaves were also used to promote wound healing ( 1 ).
Modern researchers are now studying this plant for potential medicinal uses.
The polyphenols in tamarind have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These can protect against diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes ( 1 ).
Tamarind pulp can also be used as a metal polish. It contains tartaric acid, which helps remove tarnish from copper and bronze.
Tamarind is used as a flavoring in many dishes. It may also have medicinal properties and can be used as a tarnish remover.

It is high in nutrients
Tamarind is high in many nutrients. A single cup (120 grams) of the pulp contains ( 2 ):
Magnesium: 26% of the daily value (DV)
Potassium: 16% of the DV
Iron: 19% of the DV
Calcium: 7% of the DV
Phosphorus: 11% of the DV
Copper: 11% of the DV
Vitamin B1 (thiamin): 43% of the DV
Vitamin B2 (riboflavin): 14% of the DV
Vitamin B3 (niacin): 15% of the DV
It has trace amounts of:
vitamin C
vitamin K
vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)
folate
vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid)
selenium
It also contains 6 grams of fiber, 3 grams of protein, and less than 1 gram of fat. This comes with a total of 287 calories.
These calories almost all come from sugar — but whole fruits do typically contain a lot of natural sugar. Despite its sugar content, tamarind pulp is considered a fruit, not an  added sugar .
Added sugar is the kind that’s linked to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, and it’s the kind of sugar that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that you limit ( 3 ,  4 ).
It also contains polyphenols, which are naturally occurring plant compounds that have health benefits. Many of them act as antioxidants in the body ( 1 ).
Tamarind contains vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and beneficial plant compounds.

Different forms of tamarind
Tamarind is available in prepared forms, such as candy and sweetened syrup.
You can also find the pure fruit in three main forms:
Raw pods.  These pods are the least processed form of tamarind. They’re still intact and can be easily opened to remove the pulp.
Pressed block.  To make these, the shell and seeds are removed and the pulp is compressed into a block. These blocks are one step away from raw tamarind.
Concentrate.  Tamarind concentrate is pulp that has been boiled down. Preservatives may also be added.
Pure tamarind comes in three main forms: raw pods, pressed blocks, and concentrate. It’s also available as candy and syrup.

Its antioxidants may boost heart health
This fruit may boost heart health in several ways.
It contains polyphenols like flavonoids, some of which can help regulate cholesterol levels.
One study in hamsters with high cholesterol found that tamarind fruit extract lowered total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, and triglycerides ( 4 ).
Another animal study in vivo found that the antioxidants in this fruit can help reduce oxidative damage to LDL cholesterol, which is a key driver of heart disease ( 1 ).
Tamarind pulp contains plant compounds that may protect against heart disease and oxidative damage but more research needs be conducted on human participants in order to better understand its benefits.

It’s high in beneficial magnesium
Tamarind is also relatively  high in magnesium .
One ounce (30 grams), or a little less than 1/4 cup of pulp, delivers 5% of the DV ( 2 ).
Magnesium has many health benefits and plays a role in  more than 600  body functions. It can also help lower blood pressure and has anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic effects.
However, up to 20% of people in the United States do not get enough magnesium ( 5 ).
Tamarind contains a good amount of magnesium, an important mineral that plays a role in over 600 functions in the body.

It may have antifungal, antiviral, and antibacterial effects
Tamarind extract contains natural compounds that have antimicrobial effects ( 6 ).
In fact, studies show that this plant may have antifungal, antiviral, and antibacterial activity ( 6 ).
It has also been used in traditional medicine to treat diseases like malaria ( 1 ).
A compound called lupeol is credited with tamarind’s antibacterial effects ( 1 ).
Several studies show that tamarind can combat many different microbes. It may help kill bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.

Tamarind candy may lead to unsafe levels of lead
Lead exposure is dangerous, especially for children and pregnant people. It can damage the kidneys and nervous system.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cited tamarind candy as a cause of lead poisoning in several cases in 1999.
The fruit itself doesn’t contain lead. However, because it is acidic, it may cause lead to leech from certain ceramic vessels into food ( 7 ).
Although it has fewer calories and less sugar than many other types of candy, it is still candy — making it the least nutritious form of tamarind.
Some tamarind candy has been found to contain unsafe amounts of lead, due to cross-contamination. For that reason, children and pregnant people should consult a healthcare professional before consuming it.

How to eat tamarind
You can enjoy this fruit in several ways.
One is to simply eat the fruit from the raw pods, as shown in this  video .
You can also use tamarind paste in cooking. You can either prepare it from the pods or purchase it as a block.
The paste is often mixed with sugar to make candy. Tamarind can also be used to make condiments like chutney.
Additionally, you can use the frozen, unsweetened pulp or sweetened tamarind syrup for cooking.
You may also use this fruit to add a sour note to savory dishes, instead of  lemon .
There are several ways to enjoy tamarind. It can be used in sweet and savory dishes or eaten straight from the pod.

The bottom line
Tamarind is a popular sweet and sour fruit used worldwide.
It has many beneficial nutrients.
Two of the best ways to enjoy this fruit are to eat it raw or to use it as an ingredient in savory dishes.
