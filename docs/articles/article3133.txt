Title: 12 Healthy Dinner Ideas for Two

It’s common to feel rushed at dinnertime and opt for easy options, such as fast food or frozen meals, even if you’re sharing a meal with just one other person — such as a partner, child, friend, or parent.
If you crave variety and want to spice up your routine, plenty of scrumptious, small-batch dinners take very little time to prepare and are incredibly healthy.
Interestingly, home-cooked meals are associated with improved diet quality, and family meals lead to healthier diets and less weight gain in children and adolescents ( 1 ,  2 ).
Here are 12 nutritious and scrumptious dinner ideas for two.

1. Chicken-quinoa bowl
This quinoa bowl is packed with protein.
In just a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving, quinoa provides all of the  essential amino acids , a good proportion of omega-6 fats, and 10% of the Daily Value (DV) for folate ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ).
Chicken is not only low in fat but also  high in protein , with 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of breast meat offering 28 grams of protein and 4 grams of fat ( 7 ).
This recipe serves two and is ready in under 30 minutes.
1 boneless, skinless chicken breast (196 grams), cut into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes
1 cup (240 ml) of water
1/2 cup (93 grams) of quinoa, uncooked
2 cups (100 grams) of arugula
1 small avocado, sliced
1/2 cup (75 grams) of cherry tomatoes, halved
2 large eggs
1 tablespoon (9 grams) of sesame seeds
1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
Season the chicken with salt and pepper to taste.
Bring the water to a boil and add the quinoa. Cover and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook for 15 minutes or until the water is fully absorbed.
Meanwhile, cook the chicken in  olive oil  on the stovetop. After the cubes turn brown, remove the pan from heat.
Place 3 inches (7 cm) of water in a pot and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, place the eggs in, and soft-boil them for 6 minutes.
When done, place the eggs in cold water and let cool. Gently crack the shells, then peel and slice into halves.
Portion the  quinoa  into two bowls and top with the arugula, chicken, sliced avocado, cherry tomatoes, eggs, and sesame seeds.

2. Sesame-tofu ‘fried’ rice

This recipe is  vegetarian , although you can swap the tofu for chicken or shrimp if you prefer.
It serves two and takes 1 hour to prepare.

1 cup (186 grams) of white rice, steamed
1/4 cup (25 grams) of scallions, chopped
Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the tofu between a couple of layers of paper towel and squeeze out as much water as you can. Dice into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes.
In a bowl, mix half of the sesame oil and soy sauce, plus all of the  maple syrup , apple cider vinegar, and sesame seeds. Add the tofu and coat well, then place it on the baking sheet and bake for 40 minutes.
Around 30 minutes into baking, heat a small pan and scramble the egg, then set aside.
Grease a second large baking sheet and add the egg,  rice , white onion, peas, and carrots. Drizzle with the rest of the sesame oil and soy sauce, then toss all the ingredients to distribute evenly. Sprinkle the scallions on top.
Bake for 7–10 minutes and remove both baking sheets from the oven.
