Title: 10 Magnesium-Rich Foods That Are Super Healthy

Magnesium is found in a variety of nutrient-dense foods, including whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, and several fruits and vegetables.
Magnesium is an extremely important mineral.
It’s involved in hundreds of chemical reactions in your body and helps you maintain good health, but many people don’t reach the Daily Value (DV) of  420 milligrams (mg) .
Yet, you can easily meet your daily needs by eating foods high in magnesium.
Here are 10 healthy foods that are high in magnesium.

1. Dark chocolate
Dark chocolate  is very rich in magnesium, with 65 mg in a 1-ounce (oz), or 28 grams (g), serving, which is about  15%  of the DV.
It’s also in high in iron, copper, and manganese and contains prebiotic fiber that can help feed the beneficial bacteria in the gut.
What’s more, it’s  loaded  with beneficial  antioxidants . These are nutrients that neutralize free radicals, which are harmful molecules that can damage your cells and lead to disease.
Dark chocolate is  especially beneficial  for heart health, as it contains flavanols, which are powerful antioxidant compounds that prevent LDL (bad) cholesterol from oxidizing and sticking to the cells that line your arteries.
To make the most of dark chocolate’s benefits, choose a product containing at least 70% cocoa solids. A higher percentage is even better.

2. Avocados
The avocado is an  incredibly nutritious fruit  and a tasty source of magnesium. One medium avocado provides 58 mg of magnesium, which is  14%  of the DV.
Avocados are also high in potassium, B vitamins, and vitamin K. Plus, unlike most fruits, they’re high in fat — especially heart-healthy monounsaturated fat.
In addition, avocados are an excellent source of fiber. In fact, most of the carbs in an avocado come from fiber, making it very low in  digestible carbs .
Research  has shown that eating avocados can reduce inflammation, improve cholesterol levels, and increase feelings of fullness after meals.

3. Nuts
Nuts  that are particularly high in magnesium include  almonds , cashews, and Brazil nuts.
For instance, a 1-oz. (28-g) serving of cashews contains 83 mg of magnesium, or  20%  of the DV.
Most nuts are also a good source of fiber and monounsaturated fat and  have been shown to improve  blood sugar and  cholesterol levels  in people with diabetes.
Brazil nuts are also extremely high in selenium. In fact, just one Brazil nut provides nearly 175% of the DV for this mineral.
Additionally, nuts are  anti-inflammatory , beneficial for heart health, and can reduce appetite when eaten as snacks.

4. Legumes
Legumes are a family of nutrient-dense plants that include lentils, beans, chickpeas, peas, and soybeans.
They’re very rich in many different nutrients. For instance, a 1-cup (172-g) serving of cooked black beans contains an impressive 120 mg of magnesium, which is  29%  of the DV.
Legumes are also high in potassium and iron and a  major source  of  protein for vegetarians .
Because legumes are rich in fiber and have a low glycemic index (GI), they may help lower cholesterol levels,  improve  blood sugar control, and  reduce the chance  of heart disease.

5. Tofu
Tofu  is a staple food in vegetarian diets due to its high protein content. Made by pressing soybean milk into soft white curds, it’s also known as bean curd.
A 3.5-oz. (100-g) serving contains 35 mg of magnesium, which is  8%  of the DV.
One serving also provides 10 g of protein and a good amount of calcium, iron, manganese, and  selenium .
Additionally, some studies suggest that eating tofu and other soy products  can protect  the cells lining your arteries and may be associated with a  decreased chance  of stomach cancer.

6. Seeds
Many seed varieties — including flax, pumpkin, and chia seeds — contain high amounts of magnesium.
Pumpkin seeds are a particularly good source, with 168 mg in a 1-oz. (28-g) serving. This amounts to a whopping  40%  of the DV for magnesium. In addition, seeds are rich in iron, monounsaturated fat, and omega-3 fatty acids.
What’s more, they’re extremely  high in fiber . In fact, nearly half of the carbs in most seeds come from fiber.
They also  contain  antioxidants, which  protect  your cells from harmful free radicals produced during metabolism.
Flaxseed  has also been shown to  reduce  cholesterol levels and may have benefits against breast cancer.

7. Whole grains
Whole grains  like wheat, oats, and barley, as well as pseudocereals like buckwheat and quinoa, are excellent sources of many nutrients, including magnesium.
A 1-cup (168-g) serving of cooked buckwheat contains 86 mg of magnesium, which is  20%  of the DV.
Many whole grains  are also high  in B vitamins, selenium, manganese, and fiber.
In  controlled studies , whole grains have even been shown to reduce inflammation and decrease several risk factors for heart disease.

8. Some fatty fish
Fish, especially  fatty fish , are high in magnesium. These include salmon, mackerel, and halibut.
In fact, a 3.5-oz. (100-g) serving of cooked salmon packs 30 mg of magnesium, which is  7%  of the DV.
It also provides an impressive 22 g of high quality protein.
In addition, fish is rich in potassium, selenium, B vitamins, and  various other nutrients .
What’s more, a high intake of fatty fish  has been linked  to a decreased chance of several chronic conditions, including heart disease.

9. Bananas
Bananas  are most well-known for their high potassium content, which  can help lower  blood pressure and is linked to a reduced chance of heart disease.
Plus, they’re also rich in magnesium, with 37 mg of magnesium, or  9%  of the DV, in one large banana.
In addition, bananas provide vitamin C, vitamin B6, manganese, and fiber.
Ripe bananas  are higher in sugar and carbs  than most other fruits, so they may not be suitable for people following a low carb diet.
On the other hand, a large portion of the carbs in unripe bananas is  resistant starch , which doesn’t get digested and absorbed.
Resistant starch  may also help  lower blood sugar levels, reduce inflammation, and improve gut health.

10. Leafy greens
Leafy greens  with significant amounts of magnesium include  kale , spinach, collard greens, turnip greens, and mustard greens.
For instance, a 1-cup (180-g) serving of cooked spinach has 158 mg of magnesium, or  37%  of the DV.
In addition, leafy greens like spinach are also an excellent source of several nutrients, including iron, manganese, and vitamins A, C, and K.
Leafy greens also contain many beneficial plant compounds, which  help protect  your cells from damage and may  reduce cancer risk .
