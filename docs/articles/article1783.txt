Title: 12 Best Brands of Rice

Rice is a staple food for more than half of the world’s population ( 1 ).
Given the numerous types of rice, you have a lot of options to choose from. What’s more, you may want to consider the overall quality, taste, texture, nutrient content, and a lack of additives like preservatives ( 1 ,  2 ).
Some people may also prefer to buy organic rice, as it’s less likely to have pesticide residues. Whether conventionally grown or organic, the macronutrient profile remains similar ( 3 ,  4 ).

How we chose
To help you determine which to choose, Healthline evaluated the best brands of rice based on the following factors:
overall quality
a lack of additives, including preservatives and artificial ingredients
taste and texture when cooked
nutritional value
When comparing nutrients, keep in mind that 1/4 cup (about 45 grams) of uncooked rice yields 1/2–1 cup cooked (about 125–250 grams), depending on the variety of rice and cooking method.
Here are the 12 best brands of rice.

How to choose the best rice
When shopping for rice at the store, you should examine packages carefully. Keep an eye out for products with several broken grains of rice, as this may indicate that the product isn’t as fresh.
Moreover, opt for products that are free of additives and preservatives. In fact, unless you’re buying microwavable or preseasoned rice, the only ingredient should be rice.
If you’re concerned about pesticide residues, only choose products that are USDA certified  organic .
It’s also important to consider the health benefits of  brown versus white rice .
White rice is processed to only contain the starchy part of the grain called the endosperm, while brown rice also contains the germ and bran — making it a more nutritious option ( 6 ,  30 ).
Brown rice is often higher in fiber and important nutrients. Switching from white to brown rice has been shown to help lower blood sugar levels and reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes ( 31 ,  32 ,  33 ).
General price ranges are indicated below with dollar signs ($ to $$$). One dollar sign means the product is considered more affordable, whereas three dollar signs indicate a higher cost.
Generally, prices range from $0.15–$1.44 per dry ounce (about 28 grams), or $3.49–$46.29 per package, though this may vary depending on where you shop.
Pricing guide
$  = under $0.50 per ounce (28 grams)
$$  = $0.50–$1.00 per ounce (28 grams)
$$$  = over $1.00 per ounce (28 grams)

Unlike white rice, brown rice is considered a  whole grain  because it contains all parts of the grain — the bran, germ, and endosperm. Thus, it’s often higher in fiber, protein, and certain minerals like manganese and magnesium than white rice ( 5 , 6 ).
Lundberg Family Farms is a family-owned company that offers a wide variety of grains and grain products. Their organic long-grain brown rice is one of the best on the market, as it’s certified organic, certified gluten-free, and non-GMO verified.

Basmati  has a needle-like shape and shouldn’t be as sticky as regular brown or white rice when cooked.
Pride of India is a family-owned company that offers a variety of grains, herbs, and spices from India.
While the company claims that all its products are grown organically and without GMOs, their extra long brown basmati rice is not non-GMO verified and hasn’t been certified organic by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
Still, this product is one of the best basmati options since it’s aged for up to 2 years, resulting in a noticeable floral aroma and deeper flavor than many other basmati products.

Black rice , also known as forbidden or purple rice, gets its signature purple-black hue from anthocyanin — a pigment with potent antioxidant properties ( 14 ,  15 ).
While similar to brown rice in its high fiber content and whole grain status, black rice is slightly higher in protein ( 16 ,  17 ).
The online subscription-based retailer Thrive Market offers one of the best forbidden rice options. In addition to being certified organic, gluten-free, and non-GMO, its black rice is free of added ingredients and contains only Italian-grown black rice.

Sprouting, also known as germination, involves the prolonged soaking of grains or seeds to make them more nutritious and easier to digest ( 21 ).
Specifically, sprouting has been shown to increase the protein content of brown rice ( 21 ).
Sprouting  also makes certain minerals easier to absorb by reducing levels of phytate — a plant compound that impairs your absorption of nutrients like zinc, calcium, and iron from grains and legumes ( 21 ,  22 ).

While tasty and convenient, boxed rice — also called preseasoned rice — is often packed with added ingredients like flavorings, colors, and preservatives.
These products may also be high in sodium, with some brands providing nearly half of your daily sodium allowance in just one serving ( 28 ).
Seeds of Change is an organic food company that specializes in preseasoned whole grain mixes.
Their quinoa and brown rice product uses just a handful of ingredients, including sunflower oil, sea salt, dried garlic, tapioca starch, onion powder, soy lecithin, parsley, and black pepper. While it’s not a low sodium option, it’s lower in salt than many competitors.

Frequently asked questions
There’s no one, specific “super” rice that beats all others in terms of  benefits . However,  whole grains  are more nutritionally dense than white rice.
As stated previously, they are associated with lowering risk in developing heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, prepackaged rice may not be the best option if you’re looking to avoid additives and sodium.
Both Jasmine and Basmati rice are known to be  aromatic  strains of rice, which means you might notice a subtle fragrance when cooking them ( 34 ).
You can elevate the natural flavors of these strains by toasting the grains in fat prior to cooking.
Depending on the type of rice and the recipe you’re making, you may need to wash rice prior to cooking.
In terms of cleanliness, modern rice does not necessarily need to be washed as it will be boiled or cooked sufficiently.
Rinsing rice can help wash away some of the excess starch found on the outside of the grains, which can help reduce its “sticky” texture. However, some recipes call for soaking rice, such as in recipes for stick rice, to help hydrate the grains.

The bottom line
Rice is a versatile grain that’s enjoyed globally. Still, the  multitude of varieties and options  can be overwhelming.
When buying rice, choose brands like the ones above that are considered high in quality and contain no  additives , preservatives, or unnecessary ingredients.
Finally, you should always opt for the product with the best flavor and texture for your recipe.
