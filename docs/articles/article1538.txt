Title: 30+ Foods That Are High in Vitamin E

Vitamin E is a group of powerful antioxidants that protect your cells from oxidative stress. Many nuts and oils, as well as certain fish, vegetables, and fruit are high in vitamin E.
Adequate vitamin E levels are essential for the body to function normally. If you don’t get enough, you may become more prone to infections or experience impaired eyesight or muscle weakness.
Fortunately, vitamin E is widespread in foods. As a result, you’re unlikely to become deficient unless your body is having trouble absorbing nutrients.
Nevertheless, everyone should try to eat plenty of whole foods rich in  vitamin E . The  active form of vitamin E is alpha-tocopheral .
In the United States,  15 milligrams (mg) of vitamin E per day  is considered enough for the vast majority of adults. This daily value (DV) is selected as a reference on nutrition labels in the US and Canada.

Takeaway
Vitamin E is found in nearly all foods to some extent. For this reason, most people are not at risk of deficiency.
However, disorders that affect the absorption of fat, such as  cystic fibrosis  or  liver disease , may lead to deficiency over time, especially if your diet is low in vitamin E.
Increasing your vitamin E intake is easy, even without supplements. For instance, an excellent strategy would be to add some  sunflower seeds  or  almonds  to your diet.
You can also increase the absorption of vitamin E from low fat foods by eating them with fat. Adding a tablespoon of oil to your salad could make a significant difference.
