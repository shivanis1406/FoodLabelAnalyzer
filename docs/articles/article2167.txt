Whole30 is a popular diet plan intended to promote healthy eating habits, boost weight loss, reduce cravings, and enhance your overall health.
It’s often used by people looking to lose weight, and proponents of Whole30 believe it has positive effects on everything from sleep to energy levels.

What is Whole30?
The original  Whole30  program promotes mostly whole foods,  eliminating  ingredients like grains, legumes, dairy, sugar, and alcohol from your diet.
This elimination is used to determine potential  food intolerances  and allow for a period of recovery from digestive issues and the other purported negative effects of these foods.
The elimination period is followed by a reintroduction phase. This is when you bring foods back into your diet, a single food group at a time, with a 2-day period in between for observation. If you tolerate them well, the foods can remain in your eating pattern.
While the Whole30 program promises a variety of health and emotional benefits, its restrictive nature may make it difficult for you to meet your daily nutrient needs or sustain the diet in the long term.
It’s also worth noting that there are many similarities between the Whole30 diet, the  Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) , and the  paleo diet . So, even if a dish isn’t labeled as Whole30 approved, most AIP-friendly meals and many paleo dishes are Whole30 compliant.
If you’re unsure whether a dish is Whole30 compliant, ask what ingredients it contains or check the ingredient list.
Many  meal delivery services  do offer meals that are labeled Whole30 approved, and using a delivery service can be a convenient and easy way to stick with the Whole30 program and simplify meal planning.
There are many factors to consider when selecting a service that’s right for you, including the cost, meal variety, and quality of ingredients.

How to choose the right Whole30 meal service
Consider several factors when selecting a Whole30 meal delivery service.
For starters, be sure to look for a company that offers a variety of dishes or a rotating menu, which can add some diversity to your diet and make it  much easier to stick to  your meal plan.
Most services also provide a list of ingredients. Look for dishes made using mostly whole foods that don’t have any added sugar or excess sodium,  additives , or preservatives.

Furthermore, price is an important consideration. While some companies may advertise low prices for each meal, they often tack on high shipping costs or offer discounts only for large orders or recurring subscriptions.
