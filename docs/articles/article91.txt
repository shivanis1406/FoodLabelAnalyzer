Title: 19 Healthy and Energizing Snacks

Energy snacks can help curb your hunger until your next meal. Healthy options for energizing snacks include trail mix, snack bars, and cottage cheese. You can even make homemade options.
When your energy gets low between meals and hunger kicks in, it’s important to reach for a filling snack that can power you through to your next meal.
Unfortunately, many snack foods are low in filling nutrients like protein and fiber and instead high in added sugars and refined carbs. This isn’t a good combination when you’re looking for lasting energy. The usual suspects include chips, cookies, and certain granola bars.
However, there are plenty of nourishing snacks to choose from that make excellent snack choices, including homemade recipes and ready-to-eat options.
Below you’ll find 19 tasty ideas for snacks that are healthy and energizing, including premade options you can pick up at the grocery store, and snacks you can pull together with ingredients at home.

How to choose
When you’re searching for a snack, keep the following factors in mind:
Cost:  Choose snacks that fit within your budget. Snacks don’t have to be expensive to offer health-promoting benefits!
Taste:  Are you craving a salty or sweet snack? Consider texture as well. You might want a snack that’s both crunchy and chewy — or prefer one that’s just one or the other.
Ingredients:  In general, you’ll want to choose snacks that are made with nutritious ingredients and are low in added sugar. Some people may prefer snacks made without additives like artificial colors and flavors.
Portability and storage:  Think about where you’ll be consuming your snack and whether you need a snack that’s shelf-stable and ready to have handy for eating on the go.

Frequently asked questions
If you’re looking for an energizing snack, you’ll want to choose something that’s balanced — meaning it provides protein, carbs, and healthy fats.
It’s best to avoid snacks that are high in carbs, but low in protein, fiber, and healthy fats. These snacks will not keep you feeling full and don’t provide a lasting source of energy.
Any balanced snack will raise your energy levels, especially if you haven’t eaten in a few hours.
But you should not depend on food alone to boost your energy. If you find that you have chronically low energy levels, it’s best to look at the bigger picture.
There are numerous other factors that could explain having low energy that might be worth addressing before you resort purely to snacks. You’ll want to consider your overall diet quality, sleep schedule, hydration habits, stress levels, and underlying health issues.
If you’re looking for a snack that can help you stay awake, consider a snack with caffeine like  espresso overnight oats . Caffeine is a stimulant and can temporarily help boost your energy levels.

The bottom line
When you’re craving a snack, it’s important to choose foods that are filling and high in nutrients.
Noshing on balanced snacks will not only keep your energy levels up but also ensure you’re satisfied and focused throughout your day.
Try out the healthy and energizing ideas listed above, and you’ll be prepared with plenty of nutritious snack options.
