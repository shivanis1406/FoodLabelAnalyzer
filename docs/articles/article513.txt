It’s not uncommon to step on the scale and wonder whether you’re at a healthy weight.

However, it’s important to understand that your overall health  cannot be measured  by body weight alone.
Keep reading to learn more about what maintaining a healthy body weight means and tips for safe weight loss and weight gain.

What’s an ideal weight for you?
Weight fluctuates with body size, so there’s no “ideal” body weight for all people.
According to the  National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases , several factors may influence your body weight. These may include:
lifestyle  and  dietary  habits
age
underlying health conditions
genetics
taking certain medications
Your  waist circumference ,  body fat percentage , and  body fat distribution  may also help determine your healthiest weight range.
Your best body weight range is one that promotes optimal physical and mental health. At a healthy body weight, you should feel strong, energized, and confident.
It’s important to remember that what you may think is a “perfect” or “goal” weight might not be realistic or healthy for your body type.
If you’re unsure what a healthy weight looks like for you, speak with a healthcare professional or  registered dietitian . They can give you a realistic weight range based on factors such as your age, height, body type, and health goals.
Remember, your body weight is just one health indicator. Some other health indicators also include:
diet
mental health
muscle mass
blood sugar levels
blood lipid levels

How is body weight measured?
Body mass index (BMI)  is the most common tool used to assess body weight. It uses your height and weight to give you a number value that is classified into the  following categories :
The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  notes that BMI numbers may help estimate whether you have high or low body fat. It may also help predict chronic disease and mortality risk related to both  underweight  and  overweight  status.
However, BMI numbers shouldn’t be the only diagnostic tool used to determine your health or body fat levels. BMI doesn’t account for many other factors that could influence your healthy body weight, such as:
sex
body frame
age
ethnicity
bone mass
muscle mass
fat mass
fat distribution
BMI should be combined with  blood tests  and measures of  waist-to-hip ratio  and  body fat percentage  to accurately assess your optimal body weight.
This is because a person with a high amount of  muscle mass  may be misclassified as overweight or obese despite having healthy body fat levels. Similarly, a person with a large amount of body fat around their waist may be at a  high risk  of chronic diseases but still be categorized as having a healthy BMI because of their total body weight and height.

How much should I weigh?
The  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insitute (NHLBI)  provides body weight amounts in pounds (lbs) related to height (inches) and BMI. To calculate your BMI you can use the  NHLBI ‘s calculator.
The following table may provide a clearer image of where your weight falls in the BMI classification. However, it’s important to note that the table doesn’t include BMI below 19, which may indicate underweight.

Talk with a healthcare professional if you’re losing weight, can’t seem to gain weight, or struggling to maintain your body weight even when you’re eating adequate calories. They can help make sure your weight loss isn’t the result of an underlying medical condition.
It’s important to note that tips on weight management may not be appropriate for people living with an eating disorder, such as  anorexia ,  bulimia , and  binge eating disorder .
If you have an  eating disorder , it’s critical to get the right  help  from a  healthcare team  consisting of a specialist physician, therapist, and registered dietitian.

Frequently asked questions
There is no “right”  weight for your age  because sizes among age groups vary drastically. Most assessments look at body weight using physical metrics like height, waist-to-hip ratio, and body fat percentage.
The CDC notes that a BMI between  18.5 and 24.9  is a healthy body weight range. That said, it’s important to note that BMI doesn’t take into account many factors that may contribute to healthy body weight, such as muscle mass, age, ethnicity, and body composition, among others. If you’re unsure about your body weight size, speak with a healthcare professional. They can accurately assess your body weight using several diagnostic tests.

Takeaway
Maintaining a healthy body weight is important for disease prevention, quality of life, mental health, and more.
However, it’s important to remember that everyone has a different healthy body weight. This may depend on several factors, such as your height, sex, muscle mass, age, and ethnicity.
Whether you’d like to lose, gain, or  maintain weight , it’s important to do so in a sustainable way that supports your overall health.
