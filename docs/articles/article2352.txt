Title: Foods and Beverages to Avoid with Arthritis

Some foods and drinks may increase the risk of arthritis or make symptoms worse, for instance, highly processed foods and sweetened drinks.
If you have arthritis, making the right dietary choices can not only help manage your symptoms but also reduce the risk of complications, help boost your overall well-being, and improve your quality of life.
There are  over 100  types of arthritis, but osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common. Other types include rheumatoid arthritis (RA),  psoriatic arthritis (PsA) , and gout.
They all  involve  some degree of inflammation.
What you choose to eat and drink with arthritis may affect your symptoms and overall well-being. Here, learn about some foods and beverages to avoid if you have arthritis.

Foods to avoid with arthritis
Everyone can benefit from limiting their sugar intake, and especially if they have arthritis.  Added sugars  are found in candy, soda, ice cream, and numerous other foods, including barbecue sauce, salad dressings, and ketchup.
In a  study  involving 217 people with RA, participants noted that among 20 foods, sugar-sweetened soda and desserts seemed most likely to worsen their symptoms.
What to know about added sugars
Some research links  red meat  and  processed meat  to  inflammation , which may increase arthritis symptoms.
For example, people who eat a lot of processed and red meats may have  higher levels  of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and homocysteine. These are markers of inflammation.
The  study  in 217 people with RA mentioned above also found that red meat commonly worsened RA symptoms.
A  2019 review  concluded that plant-based diets that exclude red meat may improve arthritis symptoms.
Meanwhile,  research  published in 2022 found a link between a higher risk of RA and consumption of processed meats, compared with fish and seafood. However, the authors found no link between RA and red meat or poultry.
More research is needed.
Is it healthy to eat meat?
Gluten is a group of proteins in wheat, barley, rye, and other cereals. Some  research  has linked it to increased inflammation and suggests that going gluten-free may ease arthritis symptoms.
People with  celiac disease  also have a  higher risk  of RA than those without celiac disease.
Some  limited research  has suggested that a gluten-free, vegan diet might reduce disease activity and improve inflammation.
However, more research is needed to confirm whether a  gluten-free diet  will benefit people with arthritis.
Can gluten affect arthritis?
Ultra-processed items — such as fast food,  breakfast cereal , and baked goods — tend to be high in refined grains, added sugar, preservatives, fructose, and other potentially inflammatory ingredients, all of which may worsen arthritis symptoms.
Research  suggests that highly processed foods may increase your risk of RA by contributing to inflammation and  obesity , which is also  a risk factor  for RA.
What’s more, in  a study  in 56 people with RA, those who ate higher amounts of ultra-processed food showed increased heart disease risk factors, including higher levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), a long-term marker of blood sugar control.
As such, processed foods may worsen your overall health and increase your risk of other diseases.
How to swap highly processed foods for healthier options
Diets high in  omega-6 fats and low in omega-3 fats   may worsen  symptoms of knee pain, which is common with OA and RA.
These fats are necessary for health, but an imbalance may increase the risk of inflammation.
Omega-3  is present  in oily fish, oily seeds, and green vegetables, while omega-6 occurs in margarines, vegetable shortening, and cooking oils such as corn and safflower.
Ensuring a balance between these types of oils may improve arthritis symptoms.
Tip: Use olive oil as an example of an oil that is low in omega-6 FA, while increasing fatty fish intake to help optimize omega-6 to omega-3 ratio.
Are vegetable and seed oils bad for you?
Cutting back on  salt  may be good for people with arthritis.
Foods high in salt  include shrimp, canned soup, pizza, certain cheeses, processed meats, and numerous other processed items.
A  2019 mouse study  found that arthritis was more severe in mice that consumed a high salt diet than in those whose diet had less salt.
Research  has also suggested that a  high sodium intake  may be a risk factor for autoimmune diseases like inflammatory arthritis in people. One  factor  could be that salt stimulates immunological processes that lead to inflammation.
Meanwhile, a  2015 study  linked a high sodium intake to an increased risk of RA. The study looked at data for 18,555 people.
How much salt do you need?
Dietary advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are molecules  created through  reactions between sugars and proteins or fats. They exist naturally in uncooked animal foods and are formed through certain cooking methods.
Foods  that are  high in AGEs  include:
high protein, high fat animal foods that are fried, roasted, grilled, seared, or broiled, such as:  bacon pan-fried or grilled steak roasted or fried chicken broiled hot dogs
bacon
pan-fried or grilled steak
roasted or fried chicken
broiled hot dogs
fries
American cheese
margarine
mayonnaise
When AGEs accumulate in high amounts in your body, oxidative stress and inflammation  may occur . Oxidative stress and AGE formation are linked to disease progression in people with arthritis.
People with inflammatory arthritis — such as RA — may have higher levels of AGEs in their bodies than those without. AGE accumulation in bones and joints may  play a role  in the development and progression of OA.
Replacing high AGE foods with nutritious, whole foods like vegetables, fruits, legumes, and  fish   may reduce  the total AGE load in your body.
What are AGE foods and how can you swap them out in your diet?

Beverages to avoid with arthritis
It’s true that  red wine  contains resveratrol, an antioxidant that may have health benefits. However, any  alcohol use  has its downsides.
More research is needed to confirm the role that alcohol plays in arthritis, but scientists don’t recommend drinking alcohol as a way to prevent arthritis or manage its symptoms.
For instance:
Drinking alcohol once a week or more may  increase the risk  of OA.
Alcohol consumption  increases levels  of uric acid in the body, which can contribute to gout.
A  2019 study  suggested that alcohol intake may increase spinal structural damage in people with axial spondyloarthritis.
Research  from 2021 found a link between developing alcohol consumption and RA in females, although not in males.
In brief, it’s best to limit your alcohol consumption as it  may worsen  arthritis symptoms.
What’s the link between alcohol and RA?
Sugary beverages, like sodas, may significantly increase your risk of arthritis.
In a study in 1,209 adults ages 20–30, those who drank fructose-sweetened beverages five times per week or more were  three times  likelier to have arthritis than those who consumed few to no fructose-sweetened drinks.
Drinks containing fructose may also lead to  an increase  in uric acid levels, which can worsen gout.
Sodas and other sweetened drinks contain sugar, aspartame, and phosphoric acid, which  can also affect  the body’s ability to absorb calcium, which is necessary for bone health.
Is fructose in fruit bad for you?
According to the  Arthritis Foundation (AF) , it’s not clear whether coffee is good for people with arthritis or not. On the one hand, it contains antioxidants that may help reduce inflammation. On the other hand, people should be mindful of the  caffeine  content.
If you like a cup of coffee, it’s best to:
consume no more than 1–2 cups per day
avoid drinking coffee too soon before bedtime
avoid adding too much sugar, syrup, or cream to coffee
How does caffeine affect your body?
Some  people find  that  milk  and other dairy products trigger an inflammatory reaction, but this is not true for everyone. If you can tolerate milk, it is a good source of  vitamin D  and  calcium .
Choose  low or zero-fat dairy  products to lower the risk of weight gain and unhealthy fats.
