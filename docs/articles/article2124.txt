Title: 12 Benefits of Yoga That Are Supported by Science

Some of yoga’s many potential benefits include improved flexibility, strength, and body awareness. It may also help relieve stress and anxiety.
The word “yoga” comes from the Sanskrit root word “yuj,” which means “to yoke” or “to bind.” The word itself has numerous meanings, from an astrological conjunction to matrimony, with the underlying theme being connection.
The practice originated in Ancient India as a means to further spiritual growth and the mind and body connection.
The scientific research into yoga’s benefits is still somewhat preliminary, but much of the evidence so far supports what practitioners seem to have known for millennia: Yoga can be beneficial to our overall well-being.
Let’s look at 12 of the many benefits of yoga in greater depth.

1. Yoga improves flexibility and balance
A key part of yoga involves stretching your muscles, which can help to  improve  flexibility and balance.
Flexibility is an important component of physical health. Yoga offers many styles to choose from, varying in intensity from high to moderate to mild.
Yoga seems to be especially helpful for improving flexibility in adults ages 65 and older. Reduced flexibility is a natural part of  aging , and a  2019 study  found that yoga both slowed down loss and improved flexibility in older adults.

2. Yoga helps with stress relief
The American Psychological Association reports that  84%  of American adults feel the impact of prolonged stress.
A regular yoga practise  may help  you to manage your stress levels and improve your overall quality of life.
It is important to remember that physical practice is just one aspect of yoga. Meditation, breath work, and auditory rituals, like chanting and  sound baths , have also been shown to  significantly lessen  tension and relieve stress.

3. Yoga improves mental health
Major depressive disorder (MDD)  is thought to be one of the most common mental health disorders in the world.
A 2017 meta-analysis of  23 interventions  looking at the effects of yoga-based treatments on depressive symptoms overwhelmingly concluded that yoga can now be considered an effective alternative treatment for MDD.
Both movement-based yoga therapies and breathing-based practices have been shown to  significantly improve  depressive symptoms.

4. Yoga will likely increase your strength
While most people associate yoga with stretching and flexibility, some types of yoga classes can also be considered  strength-building . It just depends on the class level, approach, and teacher. This makes yoga asana a  multimodal  form of exercise.
A  2021 meta-analysis  found yoga to be an effective strength-building practice that may help to target both upper and lower limbs.

5. Yoga may reduce anxiety
The Anxiety and Depression Association of America suggests that anxiety disorders may be the  most common  mental health disorders in the United States.
Numerous studies suggest that yoga asana  may be  effective as an alternative treatment for anxiety disorders, though several of the researchers suggest that further research is still needed to confirm this.
Yoga nidra, which is a body scan meditation, has been shown to  reduce symptoms  of anxiety.

6. Yoga may improve quality of life
There are several factors that can affect quality of life (QOL), such as relationships, learning opportunities, health, and material comforts.
For decades,  researchers  have viewed QOL as an important predictor of people’s longevity and likelihood of improvement when treated for a chronic illness or injury.
A  2019 meta-analysis  shows promising potential for yoga to improve QOL in people with chronic pain.
If you experience chronic pain, consider speaking with a healthcare professional about lifestyle measures that may help. They may be able to suggest an individualized yoga routine that could help you manage symptoms.

7. Yoga may boost immunity
Chronic stress can  negatively affect  your immune system.
When your immunity is compromised, you’re more susceptible to illness. However, as discussed earlier, yoga is considered a scientifically backed alternative treatment for stress.
The research is still evolving, but some studies have found a distinct link between practicing yoga (especially consistently over the long term) and better immune system functioning.
This is due in part to  yoga’s ability  to fight  inflammation  and in part to the enhancement of cell-mediated immunity.

8. Yoga may improve cardiovascular functioning
Pranayama , often referred to as “yogic breathing,” is an important and beneficial aspect of yoga.
In 2019, the Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine published a review of  1,400 studies  looking at the overall effects of pranayama. One key takeaway was that yogic breathing can improve the functioning of several systems in the body.
Specifically, the research summarized that the cardiovascular system benefited hugely from controlling the pace of breathing. This research indicates that yogic breathing may influence the function of the heart, brain, and lungs.

9. Yoga may help improve sleep
When measuring sleep, researchers look at a person’s ability to fall and stay asleep.  Insomnia  can affect one or both of these aspects.
Yoga has been  shown to improve  both how quickly people fall asleep and how deeply they stay asleep. This is partly due to the after-effects of exercise and the mental calming and stress relief provided by yoga specifically.

10. Yoga may improve self-esteem
Body image and self-esteem are often particularly challenging for adolescents and young adults. The good news is that several recent studies show  positive results  when using yoga to improve self-esteem and perceived body image in these populations.
There has also been promising evidence that yoga  may help  with the accompanying symptoms of obsession, anxiety, and depression in patients with  anorexia nervosa .

11. Yoga can promote better posture and body awareness
As a modern society reliant on technology, we seem to be spending more and more time sitting or hunched over devices.
However, a 2020 review of  34 research studies  found an emerging pattern: yoga improved brain functioning in the centers responsible for interoception (recognizing the sensations within your body) and  posture .
Try adding yoga poses during breaks in your workouts to promote better posture.

12. Yoga can help with burnout
It seems like  burnout  — excessive exhaustion that affects one’s health — is at an all-time high.
A  2021 study  that examined burnout among hospice workers during the COVID-19 pandemic concluded that yoga-based meditation interventions significantly reduced the effects of burnout by improving interoceptive (body) awareness.
This is the ability to notice internal signals and respond appropriately — meaning yoga may help people become more in tune with, and even more likely to listen to, their body’s signals.

The bottom line
Yoga is an Ancient Indian practice that is thought to promote spiritual growth and the mind and body connection.
Some of the many potential benefits of yoga include improved flexibility, strength, and mental health.
Find the  modality that works best for you , and remember: Investing in a yoga practice is investing in  you !
