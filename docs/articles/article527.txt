Title: What is an Anti-Inflammatory Diet and How to Follow it

Consuming certain foods and drinks while avoiding others may help you reduce and prevent inflammation. Anti-inflammatory foods can include fruits, vegetables, and fatty fish.
Inflammation is your body’s way of protecting itself from infection, illness, or injury.
However, chronic inflammation is harmful because it gradually damages healthy cells, tissues, and organs. This increases your risk of developing illnesses,  such as :
diabetes
heart disease
fatty liver disease
cancer
Fortunately, there are many things you can do to reduce  inflammation  and improve your overall health.
This article outlines a detailed plan for an anti-inflammatory diet and lifestyle.

Anti-inflammatory foods to eat
An anti-inflammatory diet is typically based on whole, nutrient-dense foods that contain  antioxidants . These work by reducing levels of free radicals, which are reactive molecules that may  cause inflammation  when they’re not held in check.
Some  anti-inflammatory foods  to include in your diet include:
vegetables , such as  broccoli ,  kale ,  bell peppers ,  Brussels sprouts ,  cabbage , and  cauliflower
fruit , especially deeply colored fruits like  blueberries ,  pomegranates ,  grapes , and  cherries
high fat fruits , such as  avocados  and  olives
healthy fats  like  olive oil  and  avocado oil
fatty fish , such as  salmon ,  sardines , herring, mackerel, and  anchovies
nuts , such as  almonds  and other  nuts
dark chocolate
spices , such as  turmeric ,  fenugreek , and  cinnamon
green tea
red wine , since a compound called resveratrol in wine may have  anti-inflammatory properties
Your anti-inflammatory diet should provide a healthy balance of  protein ,  carbs , and  fat  at each meal. Make sure you also meet your body’s needs for  micronutrients ,  fiber , and  water .
Certain diets may also have anti-inflammatory benefits, including:

processed meats  like hot dogs, bologna, and sausages
