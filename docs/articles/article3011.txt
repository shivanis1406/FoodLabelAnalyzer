Title: Top 7 Health and Nutrition Benefits of Persimmon

Persimmons are rich in antioxidants and important nutrients, such as fiber and vitamin A. They have also been linked to several potential health benefits and can be enjoyed in a variety of dishes.
People have grown persimmon trees, which are originally from China, for thousands of years for their delicious fruit and beautiful wood.
Their orange-colored fruits, called persimmons, are known for their sweet, honey-like flavor. While hundreds of persimmon types exist, the Hachiya and Fuyu varieties are among the most popular.
The heart-shaped Hachiya persimmons are  astringent , meaning they are very high in plant chemicals called tannins that give the unripe fruit a dry, bitter taste. This type of persimmon needs to be fully ripe before you eat it.
Fuyu persimmons also contain tannins, but they are considered non-astringent. Unlike with Hachiya persimmons, you can enjoy the crisp, tomato-shaped Fuyu variety even when they are not completely ripe.
You can eat persimmons fresh, dried, or cooked. They are also commonly used around the world in jellies, drinks, pies, curries, and puddings.
Not only are persimmons tasty, they’re packed with nutrients that can benefit your health in several ways.
Here are 7 benefits of persimmons, including how to add them to your diet.

1. Loaded with nutrients
Though small in size, persimmons are packed with an impressive amount of nutrients.
In fact, a 168-gram Japanese persimmon  contains :
Calories:  118
Carbs:  31 grams (g)
Protein:  1 g
Fat:  0.3 g
Fiber:  6 g
Vitamin A:  15% of the daily value (DV)
Vitamin C:  14% of the DV
Vitamin E:  8% of the DV
Vitamin K:  4% of the DV
Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine):  10% of the DV
Potassium:  6% of the DV
Copper:  21% of the DV
Manganese:  26% of the DV
Persimmons are also a good source of thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), folate, magnesium, and phosphorus.
These colorful fruits are low in calories and loaded with fiber, making them a  weight loss–friendly food .
Aside from vitamins and minerals, persimmons contain a wide array of plant compounds, including tannins, flavonoids, and carotenoids, which can positively affect your health.
The leaves of the persimmon fruit are also high in vitamin C, tannins, and fiber. They are a common ingredient in therapeutic teas.
Persimmons are high in important vitamins and minerals, including potassium, manganese, and vitamins A, C, and B. They also contain beneficial plant compounds like tannins and flavonoids.

2. Excellent source of powerful antioxidants
Persimmons contain beneficial plant compounds that have antioxidant qualities.
Antioxidants help prevent or slow cell damage by counteracting oxidative stress in, a process triggered by unstable molecules called free radicals.
Oxidative stress  has been linked  to certain chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and neurological conditions like Alzheimer’s.
Consuming antioxidant-rich foods like persimmons can help fight oxidative stress and may decrease the risk of certain chronic diseases.
Diets high in flavonoids, which are powerful antioxidants found in high concentrations in the skin and flesh of persimmons,  have been linked  to lower rates of heart disease, age-related mental decline, and lung cancer.
Persimmons are also rich in carotenoid antioxidants like beta-carotene, a pigment found in many brightly colored fruits and vegetables.
According to a  2016 research review , studies have linked diets high in beta-carotene to a lower risk of heart disease, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and metabolic disease.
Additionally, a  2015 study  involving over 37,000 people found that those with a high dietary intake of beta-carotene had a significantly reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
Persimmons are an excellent source of powerful antioxidants like carotenoids and flavonoids. Diets rich in these compounds have been linked to a reduced risk of certain diseases, including heart disease and diabetes.

3. May benefit heart health
Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and negatively affects the lives of  millions of people .
You can help prevent most types of heart disease by reducing risk factors, such as an unhealthy diet.
The powerful combination of nutrients found in persimmons makes them an excellent choice for  boosting heart health .
Persimmons contain flavonoid antioxidants, including quercetin and kaempferol. Consuming a diet high in flavonoids has been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease in several studies.
For example, a  2012 study  involving over 98,000 people found those with the highest intake of flavonoids had 18% fewer deaths from heart-related issues, compared with those with the lowest intake.
Diets high in flavonoid-rich foods can support heart health by lowering blood pressure, reducing “bad” low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and decreasing inflammation.
What’s more, the tannins that give unripe persimmons their mouth-puckering bitterness may lower blood pressure.
A  2012 study  in rats suggests that tannic acid and gallic acid, both found in persimmons, are effective at lowering high blood pressure, a major risk factor for heart disease.
Yet more research involving humans needs to be done to confirm these benefits.
Persimmons contain flavonoid antioxidants and tannins, which benefit heart health by reducing blood pressure, lowering inflammation, and decreasing cholesterol levels.

4. May help reduce inflammation
Conditions like heart disease, arthritis, diabetes, cancer, and obesity are all linked to chronic inflammation.
Choosing foods that are high in anti-inflammatory compounds can help  reduce inflammation  and lower disease risk.
Persimmons are an excellent source of the potent antioxidant vitamin C. In fact, one persimmon contains 14% of the recommended daily intake.
Vitamin C helps protect cells from damage caused by free radicals and combats inflammation in the body. It reduces free radical damage by donating an electron to these unstable molecules, which neutralizes them and prevents them from causing further harm.
C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 are substances produced by the body in reaction to inflammation.
An 8-week  study from 2015  involving 64 people with obesity found that supplementing with 500 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C twice daily significantly reduced levels of C-reactive protein and interleukin-6.
Plus, a large  study from 2016  linked higher dietary intake of vitamin C to a reduced risk of inflammatory conditions like heart disease, prostate cancer, and diabetes.
Persimmons also contain carotenoids, flavonoids, and vitamin E, all of which are potent antioxidants that fight inflammation in the body.
Persimmons are rich in the powerful antioxidant vitamin C, which helps lower inflammation, a common cause of many diseases.

5. Rich in fiber
Having too much cholesterol, especially “bad” LDL cholesterol, can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and heart attack.
Foods high in soluble fiber, such as fruits and vegetables, can help  lower high cholesterol levels  by helping the body get rid of excess amounts of it.
Persimmons are a high fiber fruit that has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol levels.
One  study from 2013  found that adults who consumed cookie bars containing persimmon fiber three times a day for 12 weeks experienced a significant decrease in LDL cholesterol, compared with those who ate bars that did not contain persimmon fiber.
Fiber  is also important for regular bowel movements and can help reduce high blood sugar levels.
Foods rich in soluble fiber, like persimmons, slow carbohydrate digestion and sugar absorption. This helps prevent  blood sugar spikes .
A  study from 2016  involving 117 people with diabetes showed that increased consumption of soluble dietary fiber led to significant improvements in blood sugar levels.
Plus, fiber helps fuel the “good” bacteria in your intestines, which can positively affect your digestive and overall health.
Fiber-rich foods like persimmons can help lower cholesterol, reduce blood sugar levels, and keep your digestive system healthy.

6. Support healthy vision
Persimmons provide lots of vitamin A and antioxidants that are critical for  eye health .
In fact, one persimmon delivers 15% of the recommended intake of vitamin A.
Vitamin A supports the functioning of the conjunctival membranes and cornea. It is also an essential component of rhodopsin, a protein necessary for healthy vision.
Persimmons also contain lutein and zeaxanthin, which are carotenoid antioxidants that also promote healthy vision.
These substances are found in high levels in the retina, a light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of the eye.
Diets rich in lutein and zeaxanthin may reduce the risk of certain eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration. This is a disease that affects the retina and can cause vision loss.
In fact, a  2015 study  involving over 100,000 people found that those who consumed the highest amounts of lutein and zeaxanthin had a 40% lower risk of developing age-related macular degeneration than those who consumed the least amounts.
Persimmons are high in vitamin A, lutein, and zeaxanthin — all nutrients that support healthy vision.

7. Delicious and easy to add to your diet
Persimmons can be added to a variety of dishes to provide an extra boost of nutrition.
These fruits can be enjoyed fresh as a simple snack or used in delicious recipes. In fact, they pair excellently with both sweet and savory foods.
Here are some ways to add persimmons to your diet:
