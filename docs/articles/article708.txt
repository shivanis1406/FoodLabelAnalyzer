Title: 13 of the Least Healthy Fruits: Sugar, Diabetes, and More

Rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, fresh fruit can be an excellent addition to a well-rounded diet ( 1 ).
However, certain types of fruit contain more sugar and calories than others. Furthermore, some fruits can cause side effects for people with health conditions such as diabetes and acid reflux. These fruits can still be enjoyed, but in smaller serving sizes.
This article takes a closer look at the fruits highest in sugar and calories, as well as the ones you may need to limit if you have diabetes or acid reflux.

1–4. Highest in sugar
Some types of fruit, both fresh and dried, are high in natural sugar. If you’re aiming to reduce your intake of carbs or sugar, stick to small amounts when enjoying these.
Dates  are known for their sweet, almost caramel-like flavor. Dried dates are often enjoyed on their own as a handy snack or used as a natural sweetener in recipes.
Although they’re rich in antioxidants and micronutrients like potassium, copper, and magnesium, they’re also high in sugar and carbs ( 2 ,  3 ).
One cup (160 grams) of dried dates contains ( 3 ):
Calories:  451
Protein:  4 grams
Sugar:  101 grams
Fat:  0.6 grams
Carbs:  120 grams
Fiber:  13 grams
Some of the most common varieties of dried fruit are apples, raisins, apricots, figs, mangoes, pineapples, and cranberries.
Compared with their fresh counterparts, they generally contain  more calories, carbs, and sugar  per serving. Most varieties are also rich in fiber, potassium, and vitamin C ( 4 ).
When you eat a handful of dried fruit, you’re consuming more calories than you would if you ate that same amount of fresh fruit. The biggest concern with dried fruit is portion size, not the amount of sugar.
Traditional dried fruits have a low to moderate glycemic index and are a good source of fiber and potassium.
Due to the higher concentration of sugar in dried fruit (even without added sugar), it’s best to enjoy dried fruits in moderation, especially if you’re looking to decrease your sugar intake.
A 1-cup (160-gram) serving of a dried fruit mixture contains ( 4 ):
Calories:  477
Protein:  4 grams
Sugar:  106 grams
Fat:  1 gram
Carbs:  126 grams
Fiber:  8 grams
Native to southeastern China, this  tropical fruit  is known for its unique taste and appearance.
It contains many key micronutrients, including vitamin C, copper, and potassium. It’s also relatively high in sugar, which may be an issue if you’re on a low carb or low sugar diet. ( 5 ).
One cup (190 grams) of raw lychee contains ( 5 ):
Calories:  125
Protein:  1.5 grams
Sugar:  29 grams
Fat:  1 gram
Carbs:  31.5 grams
Fiber:  2.5 grams
These delicious stone fruits are popular for their sweet flavor and soft, creamy texture.
Mangoes are also brimming with a variety of  nutrients , including vitamin C, folate, and copper. On the other hand, they contain a high amount of natural sugar in each serving ( 6 ).
One cup (165 grams) of mangoes contains ( 6 ):
Calories:  99
Protein:  1.5 grams
Sugar:  22.5 grams
Fat:  0.5 grams
Carbs:  25 grams
Fiber:  2.5 grams

5–7. Highest in calories
Many types of fruit are high in calories. While they can be enjoyed as part of a nutrient-dense, well-rounded diet, you may want to keep an eye on your portion sizes if you’re trying to cut your calorie intake or lose weight.
Avocados are  high in calories , thanks to their content of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats. They’re also a good source of important vitamins and minerals such as potassium, vitamin C, and B vitamins ( 7 ).
Plus, they’re loaded with fiber, an essential nutrient that can support regularity and digestive health ( 8 ).
One cup (150 grams) of avocado contains ( 7 ):
Calories:  240
Protein:  3 grams
Sugar:  1 gram
Fat:  22 grams
Carbs:  13 grams
Fiber:  10 grams
Shredded coconut is a common ingredient in baked goods, smoothie bowls, and breakfast dishes.
Although it’s rich in nutrients like manganese, copper, and selenium, it’s also high in fat and calories ( 9 ).
In particular, coconuts are high in  medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) , a type of fat that is readily absorbed by your body. MCTs have been associated with several health benefits, including improved body composition and heart health ( 10 ).
One cup (93 grams) of dried unsweetened coconut contains ( 11 ):
Calories:  560
Protein:  6 grams
Sugar:  6.4 grams
Fat:  56 grams
Carbs:  20 grams
Fiber:  14 grams
Prunes are a type of dried fruit made from plums.
Because of their fiber content and laxative effects, they’re sometimes used as a  natural remedy  for constipation. However, like other types of dried fruit, they’re relatively high in calories, carbs, and sugar. ( 12 ).
One cup (174 grams) of pitted prunes contains ( 13 ):
Calories:  418
Protein:  4 grams
Sugar:  66 grams
Fat:  0.7 grams
Carbs:  111 grams
Fiber:  12.5 grams

8–10. If you have diabetes
If you have diabetes, it’s important to eat plenty of nutrient-dense foods rich in fiber to support healthy blood sugar levels ( 14 ).
Meanwhile, foods that are low in fiber and high in added sugar should be limited, including certain forms of fruit ( 14 ).
Candied fruit is a type of fruit made by soaking and heating fruit in sugar syrup, resulting in a product with a sweet flavor and a long shelf life.
Not only is candied fruit high in calories and low in fiber, but it also packs a lot of  sugar  and carbohydrates into each serving. This may not be ideal for those with diabetes.
A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of candied fruit contains ( 15 ):
Calories:  322
Protein:  0.3 grams
Sugar:  81 grams
Fat:  0 grams
Carbs:  83 grams
Fiber:  2 grams
Fruit juice offers a concentrated amount of  carbs and sugar  without any of the fiber found in fresh fruit. Many types also contain added sugar, which can negate many of the potential health benefits that the fresh versions provide.
In a 2014 review of four studies, increased intake of sugar-sweetened fruit juice was linked to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes ( 16 ).
Also, a 2018 study in 8,492 women found that drinking fruit juice was tied to increased levels of hemoglobin A1C, a marker that is used to measure long-term blood sugar control ( 17 ).
An 8-ounce (240-mL) serving of orange juice contains ( 18 ):
Calories:  110
Protein:  2 grams
Sugar:  23 grams
Fat:  0 grams
Carbs:  26 grams
Fiber:  0 grams
While  canned fruit  can be a quick and convenient way to squeeze a few servings of fruit into your diet, it may not be the best choice for those with diabetes.
This is because it’s generally higher in carbs and sugar and lower in fiber than other types of fruit ( 19 ).
In particular, fruit canned in heavy syrup or juice is typically much higher in sugar than fruit canned in water. Thus, the water-canned version may be a better option if you’re aiming to keep your blood sugar levels in check.
A 1-cup (214-gram) serving of fruit cocktail canned in heavy syrup contains ( 19 ):
Calories:  150
Protein:  1 gram
Sugar:  36.5 grams
Fat:  0.2 grams
Carbs:  40 grams
Fiber:  3.5 grams

11–13. If you have acid reflux
Certain fruits, such as mandarins, may worsen symptoms for those with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), also known as acid reflux ( 20 ).
Although these fruits are highly nutritious and can fit into a balanced diet, you may want to limit your intake if you find that they trigger symptoms of acid reflux.
Citrus fruits such as oranges are loaded with essential nutrients like fiber, vitamin C, and potassium ( 21 ).
Unfortunately, they’re also highly acidic and may worsen heartburn for people with  GERD .
One navel orange contains ( 21 ):
Calories:  73
Protein:  1 gram
Sugar:  12 grams
Fat:  0.2 grams
Carbs:  16.5 grams
Fiber:  3 grams
Although they’re often used as a vegetable in many recipes, tomatoes are technically classified as fruit.
These nutritious fruits are rich in vitamin C, fiber, and  lycopene  — a carotenoid that has been well studied for its antioxidant effects ( 22 ,  23 ).
However, as with citrus fruits, the acidity of tomatoes and tomato-based products may trigger symptoms in people with GERD ( 24 ).
One cup (180 grams) of chopped tomatoes contains ( 22 ):
Calories:  32
Protein:  1.5 grams
Sugar:  5 grams
Fat:  0.5 grams
Carbs:  7 grams
Fiber:  2 grams
Grapefruit  is a type of citrus fruit known for its tasty, tart, and slightly bitter flavor.
It’s low in calories and rich in vitamins and minerals such as vitamins A and C, potassium, and thiamine ( 25 ).
Unfortunately, grapefruit and grapefruit juice are also common symptom triggers for people with GERD ( 26 ).
A 1-cup (230-gram) serving of grapefruit contains ( 25 ):
Calories:  69
Protein:  1 gram
Fat:  0.2 grams
Carbs:  17 grams
Fiber:  2.5 grams

The bottom line
Although fruit is highly nutritious and associated with many health benefits, some types — especially dried, juiced, and canned versions — may be high in sugar and calories.
Not only that, but certain kinds of fruit can increase blood sugar levels in people with diabetes or trigger symptoms in people with GERD.
Still, keep in mind that most fresh, minimally processed varieties of fruit can be enjoyed in moderation as part of a nutrient-dense, well-rounded diet.
