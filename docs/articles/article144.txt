Title: 10 Foods High in Omega-6, and What You Should Know

Omega-6 fatty acids are a key component of a healthy diet. They’re found in many nutritious foods like nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils.
Getting a variety of these fats in a proper balance supports overall health, and this article explains how to accomplish that.

How much omega-6 do you need?
Omega-6 fatty acids  are polyunsaturated fats found in a variety of foods.
Linoleic acid ⁠— often notated as 18:2 (n-6) ⁠— is one of the most common forms. Other types include arachidonic acid ⁠— 20:4 (n-6) ⁠— and gamma-linolenic acid ⁠— 18:3 (n-6).
They are considered  essential fatty acids  because your body needs them to function properly but is unable to produce them on its own. That means you must obtain them from foods.
On the other hand, consuming a high ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is thought to contribute to inflammation and chronic disease ( 1 ).
Some research suggests that the diets of human ancestors contained equal amounts of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. But today, Western diets are significantly higher in omega-6 fatty acids with a ratio around 17:1 ( 2 ).
According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, women and men aged 19–50 need approximately 12 grams and 17 grams of omega-6 fatty acids per day, respectively ( 3 ).
To  ensure a proper ratio , eat omega-6-rich foods in moderation and pair them with a good amount of omega-3 fatty acids from foods like fatty fish, nuts, and seeds.
Here are 10 nutritious foods high in omega-6 fatty acids, including their linoleic acid contents per serving.

1. Walnuts
Walnuts  are a popular type of tree nut that’s jam-packed with important nutrients like fiber and minerals, including manganese, copper, phosphorus, and magnesium ( 4 ).
Walnuts can be enjoyed on their own for a nutritious snack, or sprinkled over salads, yogurt, or oatmeal to boost the nutritional content of these meals.
Linoleic acid content:  10,800 mg per ounce (28 grams), or 38,100 mg per 3.5 ounces (100 grams) ( 4 )

2. Safflower oil
Safflower oil  is a common cooking oil extracted from the seeds of the safflower plant.
Like other vegetable oils, safflower oil is high in monounsaturated fat, which is a type of fatty acid that may help improve heart health ( 5 ,  6 ).
Safflower oil has a neutral flavor, which makes it great to use in stir-fries, baked goods, salad dressings, and sauces.
Linoleic acid content:  1,730 mg per tablespoon (14 grams), or 12,700 mg per 3.5 ounces (100 grams) ( 5 )

3. Tofu
Tofu  is made by coagulating soy milk and pressing the soy curds to form soft blocks.
Each serving provides a hearty dose of several key nutrients, including protein, iron, calcium, and  manganese  ( 7 ).
Try adding tofu to your weekly meal rotation by whipping up a tofu scramble, sprinkling it over salads, or swapping it in for meat in your main courses.
Linoleic acid content:  6,060 mg per 1/4 block (122 grams), or 4,970 mg per 3.5 ounces (100 grams) ( 7 )

4. Hemp seeds
Hemp seeds  are the seeds of the hemp plant, also known as  Cannabis sativa .
In addition to being loaded with heart-healthy fats, hemp seeds are a great source of protein,  vitamin E , phosphorus, and potassium ( 8 ).
Hemp seeds can be sprinkled over smoothies, cereal, salads, and yogurt for an extra dose of nutrients.
Linoleic acid content:  8,240 mg per 3 tablespoons (30 grams), or 27,500 mg per 3.5 ounces (100 grams) ( 8 )

5. Sunflower seeds
Sunflower seeds  are the nutritious seeds harvested from the head of the sunflower plant.
They’re especially high in important vitamins and minerals, including vitamin E and  selenium , both of which act as antioxidants that protect against cell damage, inflammation, and chronic disease ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ).
With their nutty flavor and tender yet crunchy texture, sunflower seeds make a great addition to trail mix,  granola bars , baked goods, and casseroles.
Linoleic acid content:  10,600 mg per ounce (28 grams), or 37,400 mg per 3.5 ounces (100 grams) ( 9 )

6. Peanut butter
Peanut butter  is a creamy spread made from roasted peanuts.
It’s not only rich in healthy fats and protein but also loaded with key nutrients like  niacin , manganese, vitamin E, and magnesium ( 12 ).
Plus, it’s versatile and easy to enjoy. Try using it as a dip for fruits and veggies, blending it into  smoothies , or adding a scoop to your favorite desserts.
Linoleic acid content:  1,960 mg per tablespoon (16 grams), or 12,300 mg per 3.5 ounces (100 grams) ( 12 )

7. Avocado oil
Avocado oil  is a cooking oil produced from avocado pulp.
In addition to being high in  antioxidants , animal studies have found that avocado oil may improve heart health by reducing cholesterol and triglyceride levels ( 13 ,  14 ,  15 ).
Avocado oil also has a high smoke point, which means that it withstands high temperatures without breaking down or oxidizing. This makes it  ideal for high-heat cooking methods , such as baking, roasting, sautéing, and frying.
Linoleic acid content:  1,750 mg per tablespoon (14 grams), or 12,530 mg per 3.5 ounces (100 grams) ( 16 )

8. Eggs
Eggs  can be a delicious, nutritious, and versatile addition to your diet, as they’re packed with an array of important nutrients like protein, selenium, and riboflavin ( 17 ).
Although they’re often enjoyed scrambled, fried, or boiled, they can also be added to breakfast burritos, sandwiches, casseroles, and salads to mix up your meals.
Linoleic acid content:  594 mg per large egg (50 grams), or 1,188 mg per 3.5 ounces (100 grams) ( 17 )

9. Almonds
Almonds  are a common type of tree nut that’s native to the Middle East but now cultivated around the globe.
They’re a great source of protein and  fiber , along with vitamin E, manganese, and magnesium ( 18 ).
Although almonds make a satisfying snack on their own, you can try  roasting  them and adding them to a food processor to make smooth and creamy almond butter.
Linoleic acid content:  3,490 mg per ounce (28 grams), or 12,320 mg per 3.5 ounces (100 grams) ( 18 )
