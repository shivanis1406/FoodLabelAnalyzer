Title: 15 Easy Ways to Increase Your Protein Intake

Some small ways to increase your protein intake may include replacing cereal with eggs at breakfast, snacking on cheese, or starting your meals by eating protein sources first.
The  Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020–2025  recommends that adult females get at least 46 grams (g) of protein daily and adult males at least 56 g daily.
However, some  researchers  suggest that eating more than this amount may help lower your risk of some health conditions, such as:
type 2 diabetes
cardiovascular disease
obesity
metabolic syndrome
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
cardiovascular diseases
A high protein intake may also help increase weight loss, enhance muscle growth, and improve your overall health.
Keep reading to discover ways to help you increase your protein intake.

How to increase your protein intake
Here are 15 easy ways to help you get more protein in your diet.

1. Eat your protein first
When eating a meal, eat the protein source first, especially before you get to the starches.
Protein increases the production of peptide YY (PYY), a gut hormone that makes you feel  full and satisfied . A high protein may also  decrease  levels of ghrelin, the “hunger hormone.”
What’s more, eating protein first can help keep your blood sugar and  insulin levels  from rising too high after a meal.
In a  2015 study , people with type 2 diabetes were served identical meals on different days. Blood sugar and insulin rose significantly less when they consumed protein and vegetables before eating  high carb foods , compared with when the order was reversed.

2. Snack on cheese
Many common snack foods, such as chips, pretzels, and crackers, are low in protein. For example, a 1-cup (30-g) serving of plain tortilla chips has  142 calories  but only 2.1 g of protein.
That said, choosing  high protein snacks  can help you get extra protein into your diet.
A 1-ounce (oz) (28-g) serving of  cheddar cheese  contains  7 g  of protein, along with nearly 30 fewer calories and 6 times as much  calcium .
Some  research  suggests that cheese may even benefit heart health.
You can enjoy  healthy cheese options  with whole grain crackers, tomatoes, or sliced apples for a satisfying snack.

3. Replace cereal with eggs
Many breakfast foods are low in protein, including toast, bagels, and  cereals .
Oatmeal  contains more protein than most cereals. However, a 1-cup (240-g) serving only provides  5 g  of protein.
On the other hand, 3 large  eggs  provide  19 g  of protein, along with important nutrients like selenium and choline.
A  2017 study  found that eating two eggs for breakfast instead of oatmeal reduces appetite and keeps you full for several hours. This may help you eat fewer calories later in the day.

4. Top your food with chopped almonds
Almonds  are high in magnesium,  fiber , and heart-healthy monounsaturated fat, yet low in digestible carbs.
They also contain  6 g  of protein in a 1-oz (28-g) serving, which makes them a better source of protein than most nuts.
A 2021 study found that your body only absorbs around  78.5%  of the energy in almonds. So, although a serving of almonds contains 170 calories, your body may only absorb 133 calories because some of the fats aren’t digested.
For an extra bit of protein, try adding a few tablespoons (tbsp) of chopped almonds over  yogurt , cottage cheese, salads, or oatmeal.

5. Choose Greek yogurt
Greek yogurt  is a versatile, high protein food. It’s made by removing whey and other liquids to produce a richer, creamier yogurt that’s higher in protein.
A 3.5-oz (100-g) serving provides  10 g  of protein, which is twice the amount in traditional yogurt. However, this may differ slightly depending on the specific brand.
A  2015 review  suggests that yogurt increases the release of the gut hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and PYY. These reduce hunger and make you feel full.
In addition, it contains  conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) , which has been shown to  promote fat loss .
Greek yogurt has a tangy flavor that goes well with  berries  or chopped fruit. It can also be used as a substitute for sour cream in dips, sauces, and other recipes.

6. Have a protein shake for breakfast
Many smoothies contain a lot of fruits, vegetables, or juice, but very little protein.
However, using  protein powders  makes it easy to create a healthy,  high protein shake . There are several types of protein available on the market, including whey,  soy , egg, and  pea  protein.
Whey protein powder  is the most popular and may help  keep you satiated  the longest.
On average, 1 scoop (28 g) of whey powder provides about  17 g  of protein.
Here’s a basic whey shake recipe:
8 oz (225 g) of unsweetened  almond milk
1 scoop (28 g) of whey powder
1 cup (150 g) of fresh berries
stevia  or another healthy sweetener, if desired
1/2 cup (70 g) of crushed ice
Combine all ingredients in a blender and process until smooth.
To boost the protein content even further, add unsweetened  nut butter ,  flaxseeds , or  chia seeds .

7. Include a high protein food with every meal
Getting enough protein at each meal is important.
Several researchers recommend consuming  30–40 g  of protein at each meal. This amount promotes fullness and preserves muscle mass better than smaller amounts eaten throughout the day.
Examples of  foods high in protein  include:
meat
fish
poultry
eggs
legumes
soy products like tofu or tempeh

8. Choose leaner, slightly larger cuts of meat
Selecting leaner cuts of meat and increasing portion sizes slightly can help boost the protein content of your meal.
What’s more, your meal may even end up being lower in calories.
For example, compare the nutritional value of a 3-oz (85-g) serving of these two  steaks :
T-bone steak:   21 g  of protein and 250 calories
Sirloin steak:   26 g  of protein and 150 calories

9. Add peanut butter to your diet
Peanut butter  is a delicious, high protein food with a creamy texture that pairs well with a variety of ingredients.
Peanut butter has been  associated with :
decreasing appetite
increasing fat burning
reducing blood sugar levels
Spreading 2 tbsp (32 g) of peanut butter on sliced fruit can boost the total protein content by  7 g .
That said, it’s important to choose natural peanut butter with no added sugars.

10. Eat lean jerky
Lean jerky is a quick and convenient way to get more protein into your diet.
However, it’s important to choose a healthy type. Many types of  jerky  contain high amounts of sodium, sugar, and preservatives, and they could be made from low quality meat.
A  2020 review  suggests choosing meats that come from  grass-fed animals . These may provide better quality meat with higher amounts of healthy  omega-3 fats .
Lean jerkies contain about  9 g  of protein per 1 oz (28 g).
They can often be stored for several months without refrigeration and are also portable and ideal for travel.

11. Indulge in cottage cheese
Cottage cheese  is high protein food. A 1-cup (210-g) serving contains  23 g  of protein and 176 calories.
A  2015 study  found cottage cheese to be as  filling  and satisfying as eggs. What’s more, full fat varieties are a good source of CLA, which may  promote fat loss  and lead to improved body composition.
Cottage cheese is delicious on its own. However, you can also try it with chopped nuts or seeds,  cinnamon , and stevia for a quick and easy breakfast.
Additionally, smaller amounts of cottage cheese make a great snack between meals and can be added to fruit salads or smoothies to bump up their protein contents.

12. Munch on edamame
Edamame  is the term for steamed  soybeans  in their unripened form.
Soybeans have more protein than  other legumes  and are popular among vegetarians and vegans. One cup (155 g) of edamame has  18.4 g  of protein and 188 calories.
Edamame is also high in a flavonoid known as kaempferol. A  2021 review  suggests that kaempferol may have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-depressant benefits, among others.
Edamame can be purchased fresh or frozen and makes a great snack. It can also be added to stir-fries, salads, stews, and rice dishes.

13. Eat canned fish
Canned  fish  is a fantastic way to boost your protein intake.
It requires  no refrigeration , so it’s wonderful for travel. It can also be enjoyed as a snack or with a meal.
A 3.5-oz (100-g) serving of canned fish contains about  19 g  of protein and just 90 calories.
Fatty fish like  salmon , sardines, herring, and mackerel are also excellent  sources of omega-3  fatty acids. These may help  fight inflammation  and improve heart health.
You can combine canned fish with  healthy mayo , serve it in a salad, eat it straight from the can, or add it to an omelet, croquette, or pasta dish.

14. Enjoy more whole grains
Whole grains are rich in important nutrients,  such as :
fiber
vitamins
minerals
antioxidants
What’s more, they could also help ramp up your intake of protein.
For instance, a 1-cup (185-g) serving of cooked  quinoa  contains  8 g  of protein, while cooked  amaranth  provides over  9 g  of protein per cup (246 g).
This is more than refined grains like white rice, which contains just  4 g  of protein per cooked cup (158 g).
Other examples of protein-rich  whole grains  include:
buckwheat
couscous
wild rice
millet
teff
Try swapping these ingredients in for refined grains in recipes like pilafs, stir-fries, and grain salads.

15. Eat more legumes and beans
Legumes are a  great source  of protein, fiber, and antioxidants.
For example, a 100-g (2.45-oz) serving of  white beans  contains  24.5 g  of protein, while 100 g of  lentils  contains  23 g  of protein.
You can add  legumes  to chillis, sauces, and patties, and you can roast them in the oven to add them to salads.

Frequently asked questions
