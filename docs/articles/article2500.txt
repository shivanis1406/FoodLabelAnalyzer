Title: The 20 Best Snack Ideas If You Have Diabetes

If you have diabetes, choosing nutrient-rich snacks can help promote fullness without causing your blood sugar to spike. These can include avocados, chickpeas, and almonds. Read on for 20 snack ideas.

1. Hard-boiled eggs
One large hard-boiled  egg  provides  6.3 grams  of protein and around half a gram of carbs. The protein helps prevent your blood sugar from rising too high after eating.
Eggs can also  promote fullness , which may  help lower  calorie intake and lead to weight loss.

2. Yogurt with berries
Berries  are a great source of fiber. For example, a 1-cup (150-gram) serving of blueberries provides  3.6 grams  of fiber, which  helps slow  digestion and stabilize blood sugar levels after eating.
Yogurt  is also associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. This is partly due to the  probiotics  it contains, which  may improve  your body’s ability to metabolize foods with sugar.
One cup of blueberries with one  156-gram  container of plain nonfat Greek yogurt contains 27.38 grams of carbs.

3. Handful of almonds
Almonds may benefit heart health in people with diabetes by  reducing  LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. They also contain a good amount of magnesium, which is  important  for proper glucose metabolism.
A  28-gram  handful of unsalted almonds contains just under 6 grams of carbs and almost 3 grams of fiber.

4. Veggies and hummus
Hummus has a small amount of protein and fat. This  may benefit  blood sugar management in people with diabetes.
One small  2020 study  with 39 adults found that those who consumed hummus as an afternoon snack reduced blood glucose and increased satiety. However, this study did not include people with diabetes. More research on hummus is needed in individuals with diabetes.
Two tablespoons  of hummus and  100 grams  of baby carrots contains 15 grams of carbs.

5. Avocado
The high fiber content and  monounsaturated fatty acids  in  avocados  may  help lower  blood sugar levels.
One  2023 study  involving Hispanic and Latino individuals with type 2 diabetes found that consuming avocado was associated with lower HbA1c and fasting blood sugar.
One hundred grams of avocado contains around  8 grams  of carbs.

6. Apples and peanut butter
Apples and peanut butter are high in fiber.  One medium apple  combined with  2 tablespoons  (32 grams) of peanut butter provides 34.74 grams of carbs and around 6 grams of fiber.

7. Beef sticks
Most beef sticks provide around  6 grams  of protein per ounce (28 grams), which may help keep your blood sugar under control. There is around 1 gram of carbs in an ounce.
Beef sticks can be high in sodium, though, which  can lead  to high blood pressure in some people if consumed in excess. If you eat beef sticks, make sure to consume them in moderation.

8. Roasted chickpeas
In a  1/2 cup  (82-gram) serving of chickpeas, there are about 7 grams of protein, 6 grams of fiber, and 22.45 grams of carbs.
One way to make chickpeas easy to snack on is by roasting them, which makes them crunchy and convenient. Try roasting them with olive oil and seasonings of your choice.

9. Turkey roll-up
Turkey roll-ups have low carb and high protein contents, which can help prevent your blood sugar levels from rising too high.
The protein in turkey roll-ups may  help lower  your appetite.
To make a turkey roll-up, simply spread a tablespoon (about 10 grams) of cream cheese onto a slice of turkey and wrap it around sliced non-starchy veggies, such as cucumbers or bell peppers.
There are around 7 grams of carbs in 10 grams of  cream  cheese , a slice of  turkey breast , and 100 grams of  red bell peppers .

10. Cottage cheese
A  half-cup  (about 112-gram) serving of small-curd  cottage cheese  provides almost 13 grams of protein and 4 grams of carbs.
According to a  2019 review  of studies, dairy products can decrease insulin resistance and improve weight loss.

11. Cheese and whole-grain crackers
While crackers can be high in carbs, the protein in the cheese and fiber in the crackers  may prevent  them from spiking your blood sugar.
Make sure you choose your crackers carefully, as many brands are high in refined flour and added sugar, which may negatively affect blood sugar levels.
To avoid these ingredients, choose crackers made with 100%  whole grains .

12. Tuna salad
Three ounces (85 grams) of canned tuna provides around  21 grams  of protein and no carbs.
Additionally, tuna provides small amounts of  omega-3 fatty acids , which have been shown to lower inflammation and  improve  cholesterol levels.
Tuna salad is made by combining tuna with mayonnaise and other ingredients, such as celery and onions. You can increase the protein by swapping the mayonnaise for cottage cheese or Greek yogurt.
There are around 2 grams of carbs in 85 grams of canned tuna with 1 tablespoon of light mayonnaise.

13. Popcorn
Three cups (24 grams) of air-popped  popcorn  contains  93 calories  and 3 grams of fiber.
However, it is higher in carbs, at around 18 grams for 3 cups. Try pairing it with a high protein food, such as a handful of dry-roasted peanuts or cheese cubes.
Keep in mind that microwave popcorn can be high in salt and fat. To avoid this, you can make your own using an air popper or on the stove.

14. Chia seed pudding
Chia seed pudding is made by soaking chia seeds in milk until the mixture achieves a pudding-like consistency.
Chia seeds are rich in many nutrients that help stabilize blood sugar,  including  protein and fiber.

15. No-bake energy bites
Energy bites are made by combining and rolling ingredients of your choice into balls.  This  recipe for matcha superfood energy bites  contains only 13 grams of net carbs per serving.

16. Black bean salad
Since black beans  contain  fiber and protein, eating them may  prevent blood sugar spikes  and  help lower  insulin levels after meals.
To make black bean salad, combine:
100 grams of black beans
100 grams of  white onion
100 grams of  red bell pepper
tablespoon of  olive oil  for dressing
One-quarter of this recipe contains around 9 grams of carbs.

17. Trail mix
Trail mix is a snack made by combining nuts, seeds, and dried fruit.
A  1-ounce  (28-gram) serving of trail mix provides 12.7 grams of carbs and almost 4 grams of protein. It also provides some healthy fats and fiber from the nuts and seeds.
Trail mix is high in calories, so limit eating too much trail mix at once. A reasonable serving size is about a handful.

18. Edamame
There are 14 grams of protein, 8 grams of carbs, and 8 grams of fiber in a  cup  (155 grams) of  edamame .
Compounds found in soy called isoflavones  may improve  cardiovascular risk factors in people with diabetes. However, more research is needed.

19. Homemade protein bars
Many store-bought protein bars are high in  added sugar , so it’s beneficial to make your own.  Homemade protein bars  can include filling ingredients like nut butters and protein powder.

20. Peanut butter celery sticks
Celery sticks are very low in calories, providing  17 calories  per 100 grams.
Adding a tablespoon or two (about  16 to 32 grams ) of peanut butter to celery sticks adds some extra protein and fiber.
One hundred grams of celery and 2 tablespoons of peanut butter contain around 10 grams of carbs.

The takeaway
There are plenty of healthy and tasty snack options if you have diabetes.
A good rule of thumb is to choose foods that are high in protein, fiber, and healthy fats, such as the foods listed in this article, which help maintain healthy blood sugar levels.
