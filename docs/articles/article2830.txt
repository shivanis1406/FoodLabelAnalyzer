Title: Do Banana Shakes Have Any Benefits?

Banana shakes are a popular drink made by blending bananas with other ingredients.
Many people enjoy banana shakes as a convenient breakfast option, quick snack, component of their fitness routine, or strategy to help reach their weight goals.
This article reviews the potential benefits, downsides, common ingredients, and best uses of banana shakes.

Potential benefits
Banana shakes are often used as a convenient way to incorporate calories and nutrition into a busy lifestyle or support a health goal like weight loss or gain. Many people also use them to support recovery from a  hangover .
Some potential applications and benefits of banana shakes include:
Weight gain . One medium banana contains approximately  100 calories . To promote weight gain, you may want to include several bananas in your shake along with other high calorie ingredients ( 1 ).
Weight loss . Bananas are rich in fiber, containing 3–4 grams each. This nutrient can enhance feelings of fullness, prevent overeating or snacking between meals, and support healthy weight loss goals ( 1 ).
Workouts . Bananas are a rich source of complex carbs, which can increase muscle glycogen stores and potassium, which helps prevent muscle cramps. They also provide a steady stream of glucose, making them perfect for fueling a workout ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
Hangovers . Alcohol increases urination and inhibits the production of certain hormones that otherwise help your body retain water. This can result in a loss of electrolytes like potassium, and bananas are a rich source of this mineral ( 5 ).
Ultimately, these shakes can be tailored to meet your specific lifestyle goals and offer a number of potential benefits.
Banana shakes are extremely versatile, and the recipe can be tailored to meet specific health needs and goals, including promoting weight loss or gain, fueling a workout, or aiding hangover recovery.

Similarly, you risk increasing the added sugar content of homemade shakes if you include ingredients like ice cream, yogurt, or refined sugar.
Second, banana shakes can be high in calories. While this can benefit those using them to gain weight or drinking them during periods of appetite loss, it may not be ideal if you’re looking to avoid excess calories in your overall diet.
The best ways to know which ingredients are in your shakes are to either make them yourself or read the ingredient and nutrition panels on commercial versions.
Depending on their ingredients, banana shakes may be high in added sugar and calories. While this may be suitable for certain uses like weight gain, some people may want to avoid these shakes.

Types
Banana shakes are versatile, and it’s easy to adjust the ingredient list to meet your personal needs and health goals.
For instance, you can make a low carb shake by using just one banana, which will contribute 23–27 grams of carbs to your smoothie. Other low carb smoothie ingredients include almond milk, soy protein powder, and raw nuts ( 1 ).
A  high protein  shake can be made by adding protein powder, nut butter (blended or powdered), and seeds.
If you’re using banana shakes to gain weight, you can use the high protein ingredients above, along with canned coconut milk, to significantly increase the fat and calorie content.
Banana shakes can also be transformed from a smoothie into a milkshake to be enjoyed as a dessert. Simply incorporate ice cream or frozen yogurt, as well as toppings like chocolate chips and whipped cream, to give your shake a delicious dessert twist.
To make your shake vegan, avoid using dairy products or other animal-derived ingredients. Instead, use a plant-based milk, such as soy, pea, hemp, or almond milk, as well as a soy- or pea-based protein powder.
Adjust the ingredients in your banana shake to make it low carb, vegan, high protein, or high calorie and high fat.

This is especially true because you can adjustments the recipe as needed to fit your specific health or fitness needs.

People aiming to gain weight can start with a basic recipe and add other high calorie, high fat ingredients to create a calorie-dense snack to enjoy between meals and help increase their body weight.
