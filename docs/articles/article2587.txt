Health benefits
Sweet potato skin is edible, and you may miss out on some health benefits if you toss it.
Sweet potato skins are very nutritious.
A medium (146 gram)  sweet potato  with the skin on provides ( 1 ):
Calories:  130
Carbs:  30 grams
Protein:  3 grams
Fiber:  5 grams
Provitamin A:  154% of the Daily Value (DV)

The  fiber  content of sweet potatoes mainly comes from the peel. Therefore, removing it will decrease your fiber intake.
Research has shown that the nutrients in vegetables and fruits tend to be concentrated around the peel. Thus, removing the peel can reduce your intake of nutrients and antioxidants ( 2 ,  3 ).
Sweet potatoes are a good source of fiber. However, their fiber content is reduced when the peel is removed ( 4 ).
Fiber helps increase feelings of fullness,  support a healthy gut microbiome , and manage blood sugar and cholesterol levels ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ).
Sweet potatoes are high in  antioxidants , particularly beta carotene, chlorogenic acid, and vitamins C and E. Furthermore, purple sweet potatoes are high in antioxidants called anthocyanins ( 9 ).
These antioxidants help prevent cellular damage and are associated with a lower risk of chronic conditions like heart disease and cancer ( 10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13 ).
Since antioxidants tend to be concentrated in the skin and just below it, eating sweet potato skins can increase your antioxidant intake ( 2 ).
Sweet potato skins are rich in fiber, antioxidants, and nutrients like potassium, manganese, and vitamins A, C, and E, all of which may help improve your health.

Are there any risks?
Sweet potato skins are safe to eat both  raw  and cooked.
However, since sweet potatoes are tubers and grow in the ground, it’s important to properly wash the outer skin to remove any excess dirt, pesticides, or debris.
To wash your sweet potato, place it under running water and scrub it with a vegetable brush. Since their skins are tough, you don’t need to worry about damaging it or the flesh.
You can eat sweet potato skins raw or cooked, though it’s important to properly clean the outer skin with a vegetable brush to remove dirt and other residue.
