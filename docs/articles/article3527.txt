Effectiveness for weight loss
Purple Carrot provides a variety of plant-based foods, which may be beneficial for weight loss. Similarly, Green Chef caters to several diet patterns that could help improve  body composition .
All recipes from Purple Carrot are  vegan .
Studies suggest that plant-based diets could be beneficial for weight control and may even decrease body fat ( 1 ,  2 ).
Other research has found that those following a vegan or vegetarian diet are less likely to have overweight or obesity and tend to have a lower body mass index (BMI) than those following a more traditional eating pattern ( 3 ,  4 ).
Purple Carrot also provides several low calorie meals, clearly labeled on its menu, that could help support  weight loss .
Furthermore, Purple Carrot promotes eating more healthy meals at home, which could be linked to improved diet quality and reduced body fat ( 5 ,  6 ).
Green Chef makes it easy to add more nutritious whole foods to your diet, which can contribute to weight loss and improve overall health.
Although Green Chef doesn’t offer a specific meal plan for weight loss, it does provide information on the nutritional value for each recipe, including the  number of calories  in each serving.
Green Chef tailors meals to several eating patterns that have been linked to weight loss, including plant-based, Paleo,  ketogenic , and  low carb diets  ( 1 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ).
Like Purple Carrot, Green Chef encourages members to enjoy more home-cooked meals and provides portion- and calorie-controlled recipes, which may support weight management and improvements in body composition ( 5 ,  6 ).

Other benefits
Here are some of the other benefits associated with each service.
Plant-based diets have been linked to many powerful health benefits and can help support brain function, enhance blood sugar levels, and improve  heart health  ( 10 ,  11 ).
Switching to a plant-based diet may be a way to decrease your carbon footprint, as studies show that plant-based foods typically have a lower environmental impact ( 12 ).
Purple Carrot is also committed to promoting  sustainability  and uses mostly recyclable packaging.
What’s more, it can be a convenient alternative to other services, as it’s one of the few companies that offers options for breakfast, lunch, and snacks as well as dinner.
Green Chef meals are made with mostly organic ingredients and are free of steroids, growth hormones,  genetically modified organisms (GMOs) , and antibiotics.
The company also partners with local suppliers whenever possible to source the highest quality ingredients available.
Plus, all the packaging is made from recyclable, reusable, or compostable materials, and the company can offset 100% of carbon emissions from operations.
Green Chef is also one of the few meal delivery services offering options suitable for a  gluten-free diet .
In fact, all recipes on its Keto + Paleo plan are grain-free and certified gluten-free. That means they’re safe options for people with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity ( 13 ,  14 ,  15 ).

Downsides
Here are a few of the drawbacks to consider with each service.
According to Purple Carrot, although most non-produce items are organic, many recipes do contain conventional ingredients due to sourcing constraints. So, Purple Carrot may not be ideal if you prefer to eat mostly organic foods.
There’s also limited information on where Purple Carrot sources ingredients, which could be a key consideration if you prefer to eat locally grown foods or support local businesses.
Because of the risk of  cross contamination , you may need to be cautious when ordering meal kits from Purple Carrot if you have severe food allergies or intolerances.
Additionally, there are very few options suitable for certain  diet patterns , such as ketogenic, low carb, or Paleo diets.
Compared with similar services, Green Chef can be relatively pricey, with plans starting at $11.99 per serving.
In addition to each plan’s base price, there’s also a fee for shipping.
Furthermore, although Green Chef does offer certified gluten-free recipes on its Keto + Paleo plan, meals are manufactured in a facility that handles other common  food allergens .
Therefore, if you have severe food allergies or  sensitivities , you may need to consult with your doctor before using Green Chef.

The bottom line
Purple Carrot and Green Chef are two services designed to help you prepare more  healthy , home-cooked meals.
Purple Carrot is focused on plant-based recipes and offers several meals, including various breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and snacks.
Green Chef tailors meals to several different dietary restrictions and uses mostly organic produce, which may be preferable for some people.
