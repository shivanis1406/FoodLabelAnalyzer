Title: Testosterone Booster Supplements: Efficacy and Best Options

Research on testosterone boosters is inconclusive, but some ingredients may be beneficial. If you’re experiencing symptoms like erectile dysfunction or depression, talk with a doctor before trying testosterone boosters.
Though many supplements claim to help boost testosterone levels, viable research on these products is lacking. Meanwhile, most studies focus on the effects of individual ingredients rather than proprietary blends.
One  2019 review  of older studies concluded that only 30% of study participants experienced an increase in testosterone levels using ingredients found in popular over-the-counter (OTC) testosterone booster supplement blends, including:
tongkat ali extract
horny goat weed
saw palmetto extract
boron
nettle extract
maca root powder
ashwagandha root extract
fenugreek
bioperine
DIIM
Testosterone booster supplements may work for some people, but more research is needed to evaluate their safety and effectiveness for the larger population.

Testosterone production is highest in males from adolescence through early adulthood. After you reach 30 years old, testosterone declines by about  1%  a year. Low “T,” as testosterone is often called, can impair health in several ways, including increasing the risk of erectile dysfunction and even  depression .
In recent years, the idea of naturally boosting testosterone that’s lost due to aging, obesity, or lifestyle choices such as drinking alcohol has gained attention. But the science behind this is spotty.
Though some natural substances, such as fenugreek seed extracts and ashwagandha root, have shown promise for increasing T levels in some males, this result is not a given. Lifestyle and dietary changes may be more helpful.
This article examines supplements that have the strongest research supporting their potential use. We also look at other natural methods that may help boost testosterone.
At Healthline, we respect and acknowledge an individual’s  sex, gender , and  sexual orientation . Throughout this article, we use the terms “men” and “male” as the sex assigned at birth as most studies we source use these terms. However, this article pertains to anyone looking to increase their testosterone levels.

How testosterone boosters work
Testosterone boosters aim to improve the levels of testosterone, a hormone that  plays a key role  in several aspects of health. These supplements include compounds that can either increase testosterone or related hormones directly, or help prevent your body from converting testosterone into  estrogen .
In theory, maintaining “normal” blood levels of testosterone  may help prevent  symptoms or conditions associated with low testosterone levels, which is when testosterone levels fall  below 300 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL) .
Healthy testosterone levels depend on your age.  Experts recommend  older men aim for testosterone levels between 500 and 800 ng/dL, while younger men aim for testosterone levels between 600 and 900 ng/dL.
However, while there are evidence-based ways to naturally support healthy testosterone levels, there’s limited research on the effectiveness of testosterone boosters.
Some nutrients and herbal extracts often used as  testosterone boosters  have been linked to additional benefits, including:
improvements  in  sperm health
enhanced  sexual function
increased  exercise performance
Still, more research is needed on the effectiveness and potential benefits of these supplements.
If you’re looking for a simple way to try and  naturally increase testosterone levels , the supplements on this list may be beneficial.

A note of caution about testosterone boosters
Although various ingredients have been shown to increase testosterone levels in some populations, research on the safety and effectiveness of OTC testosterone boosters is lacking.
As noted above, only  30%  of people experience an increase in testosterone levels when taking supplements containing common testosterone-boosting ingredients.
Furthermore, many popular testosterone boosters on the market contain a wide range of herbal ingredients or other compounds, some of which could interact with certain medications and health conditions.
Also, if you think you may have low testosterone, it’s best to speak with a qualified healthcare professional. There are several health conditions that share symptoms of low testosterone as well as diseases that can cause low testosterone, such as hypothyroidism and certain cancers.
Therefore, it’s important to never self-diagnose low testosterone and instead seek advice from a qualified healthcare professional if you’re experiencing symptoms that may be related to low testosterone.

Ingredients and supplements to consider
General prices for supplements that may help boost testosterone levels range from affordable to expensive. The following range is indicated for the products listed below. Check each label to determine how many servings each product contains.
$  = under $10
$$  = $10 to $25
$$$  = over $25
Though some people may prefer products that contain a blend of nutrients and herbal ingredients, a single-nutrient supplement may be a better option for others.
Below, we discuss herbs and nutrients that may be helpful for naturally increasing testosterone levels and include a single-nutrient or single-herb product option.

Ashwagandha
What it is:   Ashwagandha  is an herb used in Ayurvedic medicine as an adaptogen, which means it  helps  your body handle  stress and anxiety . Research:  A  2022 study  including 50 men with low sexual desire found that, compared with those who took a placebo, participants who took a 600-milligram (mg) supplement of ashwagandha per day for 8 weeks experienced significant increases in perceived sexual well-being and a significant increase in testosterone levels.
However, study participants were men with normal testosterone levels.
A  2019 study  with 57 men found that taking 600 mg of ashwagandha extract increased testosterone levels by nearly 15% and led to an 18% greater increase in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), a male sex hormone involved in testosterone production, after 8 weeks compared with a placebo.
Although these findings are promising, more research is needed before strong conclusions can be made.
Also, keep in mind that these effects on testosterone and DHEA-S are  not sustained over time  after ashwagandha is discontinued — meaning you’d have to keep taking ashwagandha supplements to possibly maintain these effects.
Moreover, researchers aren’t sure exactly how ashwagandha works to support testosterone and DHEA-S levels. More research is needed to understand how this herb affects hormonal health.

Vitamin D
What it is:  Vitamin D  is a fat-soluble vitamin that your body produces when exposed to sunlight. Low vitamin D is extremely common. It’s  more likely  to occur in people with limited sunlight exposure, older adults, those with dark skin, and people who have more body fat.
In its active form, vitamin D functions as a steroid hormone in your body and is  essential  for male sexual function.
Research:   Some research  suggests that having lower blood levels of vitamin D could be linked to decreased testosterone levels in men. For example, in a small  2020 study , 10 days of sun exposure and 6 weeks of vitamin D supplementation led to significant increases in vitamin D and testosterone levels in soccer players.
However,  other studies  have found that vitamin D supplementation has no effect on testosterone levels. That said, maintaining optimal vitamin D status is essential for overall health. It may help reduce the risk of a number of health conditions, such as  osteoporosis  and  depression .
Therefore, increasing your sun exposure, eating more  vitamin D-rich foods , or using a vitamin D supplement could be beneficial for overall health.
Although research on the best dosage to specifically support testosterone levels is lacking, most guidelines recommend dosages of  400–2,000 international units (IU)  of vitamin D per day to prevent deficiency in people with normal levels.
However, people with low or deficient vitamin D levels  require  much larger dosages of supplemental vitamin D. If you have low or deficient levels, a healthcare professional will recommend the most effective dose for your health needs, which may include taking up to 50,000 IU of vitamin D weekly.

Fenugreek
What it is:   Fenugreek  is a popular herb used in cooking as well as in alternative medicine. While more research is needed, it may support  healthy testosterone levels .
Research:  In a  2016 study , men who took 600 mg of fenugreek extract daily for 12 weeks experienced a significant increase in testosterone levels and improvements in sexual function compared with those who took a placebo.
A small  2017 study  with 50 participants found that taking 500 mg of fenugreek extract per day increased free testosterone levels by up to 46% in 90% of participants after 12 weeks. The extract also improved mental alertness and mood in most participants.
The authors of a  2020 review  also concluded that fenugreek extract is effective in enhancing testosterone levels. Fenugreek may boost testosterone levels by  inhibiting enzymes  that convert testosterone into other hormones and blocking testosterone breakdown.
Still, the research on fenugreek is limited. Larger, long-term studies are needed.

Zinc
What it is:   Zinc  is an essential mineral that contributes to more than 100 chemical processes within your body.
Research:  Studies have found links between  zinc and sexual health , including testosterone levels. The authors of a  2018 review  note that low zinc levels can negatively affect  men’s sexual health  and fertility.
A  2023 review  that included eight human studies found that zinc deficiency was associated with reduced testosterone levels and that higher blood levels of zinc were positively correlated with total testosterone levels. The review also found that zinc supplementation improved testosterone levels.
Additionally, a  2021 study  including 116 postmenopausal women with low zinc levels found that zinc supplementation increased testosterone levels and improved overall sexual function.

Natural ways to boost testosterone
Though several supplements may support healthy testosterone levels, the best way to maintain optimal testosterone is to follow a nutritious and balanced diet, maintain a moderate weight, and avoid lifestyle choices associated with low testosterone. It’s best to avoid smoking and heavy drinking, too.
Read more about how to increase testosterone levels naturally.

Who may be interested in boosting testosterone?
Low testosterone can affect many aspects of health in men and women.
For example, people with low levels of testosterone may experience symptoms like:
reduced sex drive
weight gain
low energy
decreased bone mineral density
Testosterone deficiency  can also lead  to erectile dysfunction and loss of facial hair  in men  and irregular periods and pain during sex  in women .
Because low testosterone can harm both physical and mental health, it’s essential to get the right diagnosis and medical care. If a doctor diagnoses low testosterone, they  may recommend  hormone replacement therapy, which can effectively increase your testosterone levels.
If you’re interested in trying supplements to boost your testosterone, always clear it with a doctor or other healthcare professional first, especially if you’re taking hormone replacement therapy or one or more medications.

When to talk with a doctor
It’s best to talk with a healthcare professional if you’re experiencing  symptoms of low testosterone , such  as:
decreased sex drive
erectile dysfunction
muscle loss
hot flashes
fatigue
A healthcare professional can  check  your blood levels to determine whether you have  low testosterone  and develop a treatment plan to address your needs. They can also evaluate whether other factors or conditions could be contributing to your low testosterone levels and whether those conditions need to be addressed.
It’s a good idea to talk with a healthcare professional before adding any supplements to your routine, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medications that could interact with herbal supplements.
