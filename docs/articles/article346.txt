What is almond butter?
Almond butter is a nut spread made by roasting and grinding almonds into a light brown paste or spread that resembles peanut butter.
Some brands may also blanch the almonds before grinding by removing the outer skin, resulting in a smoother, lighter, and less gritty butter.
Furthermore, while some commercial almond butters only contain  almonds , others may add additional ingredients during the grinding step, including salt, sugar, honey, low calorie sweeteners, protein, cocoa powder, cinnamon, vanilla extract, stabilizers, and emulsifiers ( 1 ).
Stabilizers help prevent the separation of oils from the paste when the butter is stored at room temperature, while emulsifiers reduce butter stickiness to keep it from sticking to the roof of the mouth ( 1 ).
Almond butter is a nutrient-dense food rich in  heart-healthy fats  and fiber. It also provides a good amount of plant-based protein, vitamins, and minerals, such as calcium and potassium ( 1 ,  2 ).

Other key ingredients:  macadamia nuts, coconut, cinnamon, cacao, pink Himalayan salt, erythritol, and stevia
The ketogenic, or keto, diet is a very low carb, high fat diet. Almond butters can be a great addition to a ketogenic diet because they provide ample amounts of fat, as well as other important nutrients.
The SuperFat Nut Butter contains a blend of almonds and macadamia nuts, coconut, cinnamon, cacao, pink Himalayan salt, erythritol, and stevia. It fits well into a  keto diet , as it packs fat and protein without any added carbs.
Generally, those who follow the keto diet should steer clear of almond butters that have added sugars. You want to have fewer than 2 or 3 net carbs per serving.
Net carbs  are the carbs your body digests after you subtract the dietary fiber, which isn’t absorbed by the body — though, keep in mind this method is not 100 percent accurate.
The SuperFat Nut Butter offers 15 g of fat, 4 g of protein, 5 g of dietary fiber, and 2 g of net carbs per 1-oz. (30-g) serving. It’s also sold in a convenient pouch, which can be useful if you’re an endurance athlete or lead a busy life.
It doesn’t include ingredients like honey or evaporated cane juice, which would provide added carbs that may knock you out of  ketosis , a metabolic state in which your body digests fats instead of carbs as its main fuel source.

No added anything — including sweeteners, sodium, or stabilizers — makes the Georgia Grinder’s Salt-Free Almond Butter the best choice for people with  diabetes .
Its only ingredient is roasted almonds. However, all of their products — including peanut butters — are processed on shared equipment, and while they claim to thoroughly sanitize all equipment, you may still want to be cautious if you have  peanut allergies .
At 7 g of protein and 7 g of carbs, or 4 g of net carbs per 2-tablespoon (32-g) serving, this well-balanced almond butter includes a mix of dietary fiber, fat, and protein — which, together, can help keep your blood sugar levels more stable ( 3 ,  4 ).

Other key ingredients:  pecans and erythritol
For those on a  low carb diet , Legendary Foods’ Pecan Pie Flavored Almond Butter is a great choice. What’s more, it’s vegan-friendly.
This product blends almonds with pecans and dashes in  erythritol  to keep net carbs low, at 3 g per 2-tablespoon (32-g) serving.
Erythritol is a sugar alcohol that functions as a low calorie sweetener ( 5 ).
Its pecan pie flavor may help satisfy your sweet tooth. For a dessert-like, low carb shake, add the following to a blender:
2 tablespoons (32 g) of Legendary Foods’ Pecan Pie Flavored Almond Butter
1/2 cup (about 4 cubes) of ice
1 cup (244 ml) of unsweetened almond milk
2 tablespoons (28 g) of 5% fat Greek yogurt
This shake brings you to a grand total of 5 g of net carbs ( 6 ,  7 ).
You can also add in half a medium banana with an additional 12 net g of carbs if that’s within your carb allowance ( 8 ).

The Better Almond Butter is  certified organic  and made from sprouted Spanish almonds.
Sprouting  is the process of soaking legumes and nuts for a period of time to allow them to start growing seedlings. This is believed to increase the absorption of nutrients and the production of plant compounds with potential health benefits ( 9 ,  10 ).
This particular product hasn’t had any recalls due to bacterial infections. However, it should be noted that those with compromised immune systems, such as people who are pregnant or undergoing chemotherapy, should generally avoid raw, sprouted products, as these have recently been linked to  Salmonella  ( 11 ).
Better Almond Butter is delicious on apple slices or celery for added fiber, or try spreading it on a piece of whole-grain toast.

No single product or ingredient will cause you to lose weight. However, if you are trying to reach or maintain a moderate weight, almond butter can be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet.
Wild Friends’ Classic Creamy Almond Butter stands out for its slightly higher protein content at 7 g per 2-tablespoon (32-g) serving.
This, paired with the natural fats in almonds, can promote feelings of fullness and keep you energized through a workout ( 12 ).
Its creamier, thinner texture makes it ideal for drizzling into smoothies or yogurt, or for mixing into a bowl of  oatmeal .
And it’s free of added sugars and sweeteners that could contribute to weight gain.

Justin’s Classic Almond Butter has a satisfying taste, high quality ingredients, and a smooth, creamy texture. It’s also the most affordable product on our list.
Each 2-tablespoon (32-g) serving packs 19 g of fat, 6 g of protein, and 6 percent of the Daily Value (DV) for both iron and calcium.
Iron is important for healthy red blood cells, while  calcium  is critical for bone and heart health ( 13 ,  14 ).
It’s even sold in single-serve squeeze packets, which can be especially convenient for busy parents or athletes. Along with its classic flavor, you can also get this almond butter in maple, vanilla, and  cinnamon .
It does contain palm oil, but it’s sustainably sourced. Palm oil is commonly used to stabilize products like almond butter so that it doesn’t separate as much and doesn’t require as much stirring.

While specialty almond butters can be delicious and convenient, they can also leave your wallet feeling a little lighter.
For a thrifty alternative, try making your own.
To do so, you’ll need the following:
3 cups (360 g) of raw, unsalted almonds
optional flavorings like a dash of salt,  honey , cinnamon, vanilla extract, or cocoa
a food processor
an oven
1 large cookie sheet
1 rubber spatula
To make your own:
Preheat your oven to 350°F (177°C). Then, place the raw almonds on a cookie sheet and bake for 10 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let cool for an additional 10 minutes. These steps help make your almonds easier to break down.
Add your almonds to a food processor and pulse. It may seem like your almonds won’t break down into a paste, until they suddenly do.
Let it get smooth and creamy, scraping the sides of your food processor as needed. You may add a dash of salt, or other optional flavorings at this point, to taste.
Now you have delicious, natural, homemade almond butter. Slather this on whole-grain toast or dollop it onto yogurt or oatmeal. Refrigerate any leftovers.

What are the benefits of almond butter?
Almonds are a highly nutritious tree nut that provide heart-healthy fats, fiber,  plant-based protein , and antioxidants. Therefore, they have numerous health benefits to offer, both when consumed whole or when made into butter ( 15 ,  16 ).
For example, research suggests that almonds may help reduce the risk for heart disease by improving blood cholesterol parameters.
Several studies show that almonds may lower total and LDL (bad) cholesterol and increase HDL (good) cholesterol levels. This effect is attributed to almonds’ high levels of unsaturated fatty acids — namely mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids, or MUFAs and PUFAs ( 16 ,  17 ,  18 ).
Additionally, almonds’ low  glycemic index  and protein, fat, fiber, and antioxidant content may also help manage blood sugar levels and body fat by slowing the rate at which your stomach empties its contents and inhibiting sugar-digesting enzymes ( 16 ,  19 ,  20 ,  21 ).
Furthermore, adding almonds — or almond butter — to your diet may also improve your gut health, blood pressure, diet quality, and inflammatory markers ( 16 ,  21 ,  22 ,  23 ).
Keep in mind that to best reap the benefits of almonds, it’s best to choose minimally processed almond butters with short ingredients lists.

How to choose the best almond butter
The number one thing to consider when buying almond butter is its ingredient list, as there are many you should try to avoid.
For instance, aim for a butter without added salt and sugar or with a low amount of  added sugar , including honey. While both are primarily used to improve the butter’s flavor, they may contribute to high sodium and sugar intakes throughout the day, which is associated with detrimental health effects ( 24 ,  25 ,  26 ).
Similarly, opt for a butter without added fats or oils, which could significantly increase your butter’s total calorie and saturated fat content — the type of fat that may be associated with an increased risk of heart disease ( 27 ).
Check the label to find out if the product blends almonds with other nuts or if it is processed in a facility that also processes peanuts. This is especially important for people with  food allergies .
Also, consider added flavors and the product’s texture to ensure it aligns with your personal preferences. And note that some brands offer single-serving packets, which might be more convenient if you need to take your almond butter on the go.
Finally, don’t forget to factor in the price per serving to make sure you make the most of your budget.

Frequently asked questions about almond butter
While people with peanut allergy are not necessarily allergic to tree nuts, about 30 percent of people with a  peanut allergy  may also react with skin, respiratory, and gastrointestinal symptoms upon tree nut consumption ( 28 ).
Despite not being botanically related, cross-reactivity may occur due to the similarity of allergenic proteins between peanuts and tree nuts, including almonds ( 28 ,  29 ,  30 ).
Therefore, it would be best to avoid almond butter if you have a peanut allergy.
Yes, almond butter is safe for dogs.
However, you should avoid feeding them flavored or sweetened butters — especially if they contain artificial sweeteners such as  xylitol , which could harm your dog.
In addition, you should avoid feeding them almond butter in large amounts to prevent digestive issues, including diarrhea and gas. Try giving almond butter to your pup as a treat or spread it onto a toy to keep them entertained for a while.
Yes, it is a typical trait of almond butters made without stabilizers.
Stabilizers such as palm, rapeseed, soybean, and  cottonseed oil  in nut butters prevent the separation of the less dense oil fraction during storage at room temperature. This leads to a solid paste settling at the bottom while an oil layer remains on top ( 1 ,  31 ).
While the separation of the oil is not a sign of decay, it may increase the degradation of lipids or fats, which may result in premature rancidity ( 31 ).
To incorporate the oil back into the butter, mix thoroughly until you reach a creamy consistency.

The bottom line
There are many almond butters on the market. These can be a great addition to your diet given their high fat and protein content, as well as  iron  and calcium, which will keep you feeling full and satisfied.
Whether keto-friendly, organic, or low carb — this product roundup has you covered.
For the thriftiest alternative, try making your own and experimenting with flavors.
