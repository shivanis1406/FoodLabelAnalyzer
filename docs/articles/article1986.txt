Title: 10 of the Best Foods to Help You Heal

Many foods, including fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, and protein sources, have been shown to reduce inflammation, improve immune function, promote healing, and provide the fuel necessary for you to get on the mend.
Whether you’re recovering from an illness or surgery, the foods and beverages you consume can either help or hinder your recovery.
Here are 10 healing foods that can help your body recover.

1. Leafy green vegetables
Leafy green vegetables like kale, spinach, arugula, mustard greens, and Swiss chard are packed with nutrients that decrease inflammation, enhance immune function, and improve wound healing, making them the perfect choice to promote recovery.
Leafy greens  are high in vitamin C, manganese, magnesium, folate, and provitamin A, all of which are essential for immune function and overall health ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
They’re also rich in polyphenol antioxidants that have powerful anti-inflammatory and immune-supportive properties ( 3 ,  4 ).
In fact, research shows that certain polyphenols, including the antioxidant  quercetin , that are concentrated in green leafy veggies, may help suppress the production of inflammatory proteins like TNF-alpha ( 5 ).
What’s more, vitamin C is essential for wound healing, making leafy greens a good choice when recuperating after surgery ( 6 ).

2. Eggs
Following surgery, your body needs  significantly more protein  than the current Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of 0.36 grams per pound (0.8 grams per kg) of body weight.
The American Society for Enhanced Recovery recommends 0.7–0.9 grams of protein per pound (1.5–2 grams per kg) of body weight after surgery. That equals 105–135 grams for a 150-pound (68-kg) person ( 7 ).
Eggs  are not only an excellent source of highly absorbable protein, providing 6 grams per large egg (50 grams), but also nutrients that support immune health and wound healing ( 8 ).
Whole eggs contain vitamins A and B12, as well as zinc, iron, and selenium, all of which play vital immune roles ( 1 ).

3. Salmon
Salmon is packed with protein, B vitamins, selenium, iron, zinc, and omega-3 fats ( 9 ).
What’s more, studies show that its omega-3 fats may promote wound healing, enhance immune response, and reduce inflammation when taken in supplement form ( 10 ).
Plus, just 3 ounces (85 grams) of  wild-caught salmon  delivers over 70% of your daily needs for selenium, a mineral that regulates inflammation and immune response ( 11 ).
Although eating salmon is likely safe, you should talk to your healthcare provider before taking  fish oil supplements  before or after surgery. Recent research indicates that these supplements don’t increase bleeding risk, but some surgeons advise against fish oil anyway ( 12 ).

4. Berries
Berries  are brimming with nutrients and plant compounds that can help support your body’s recovery.
For instance, berries provide ample vitamin C, which promotes wound healing by stimulating the production of  collagen  — the most abundant protein in your body ( 13 ).
They also pack antioxidants like anthocyanins, which are plant pigments that give berries their vibrant color, in addition to providing anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immune-supporting effects ( 14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 ).

5. Nuts and seeds
Nuts and  seeds  like almonds, pecans, walnuts, sunflower seeds, and hemp seeds are a great choice for fueling your body during the recovery process. These foods provide plant-based protein, healthy fats, and vitamins and minerals that support healing.
For example, nuts and seeds are a good source of zinc, vitamin E, manganese, and magnesium.  Vitamin E  acts as an antioxidant in your body, protecting against cellular damage. It’s also critical for immune health ( 18 ).
Some studies note that healthy vitamin E levels may improve the function of protective immune cells, such as natural killer cells (NK cells), which help fight infection and disease ( 19 ,  20 ,  21 ).

6. Poultry
Specific amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein, play important roles in wound healing and immune function.
Poultry, including  chicken and turkey , pack glutamine and arginine, two amino acids that may aid recovery and healing ( 22 ).
Glutamine  provides cellular protection during times of stress, such as illness and injury, while arginine assists collagen production and wound healing ( 23 ).
What’s more, arginine is rapidly depleted during times of stress, injury, and illness, making adequate intake of this amino acid all the more important ( 23 ).

7. Organ meats
Organ meats are some of the most nutritious foods you can eat. They boast many immune-supportive nutrients, including vitamin A, iron, zinc, B vitamins, and copper, which is needed for the production of connective tissue and collagen ( 24 ,  25 ).
Vitamin A, which is essential for proper immune cell response, helps inhibit inflammatory cells and is critical for  skin health  and wound healing ( 26 ).
Additionally,  organ meats  are an excellent source of protein, which is necessary for recovery after surgery and illness.

8. Cruciferous vegetables
Cruciferous vegetables like cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and  kale  are well known for their impressive health benefits. They may support recovery thanks to their wide variety of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
Cruciferous veggies contain glucosinolates, which are compounds that your body converts into isothiocyanates. Isothiocyanates have been shown to promote immune health by suppressing inflammation, activating immune defenses, and inducing death in infected cells ( 27 ).
Plus, these veggies pack an array of nutrients that your body craves during recovery, such as vitamin C and  B vitamins  ( 28 ).

9. Shellfish
Shellfish  like oysters, mussels, and clams are loaded with nutrients — especially zinc — that may promote recovery.
Zinc is crucial for healthy immune function. This mineral may also help speed recovery and promote wound healing, making shellfish great for recuperating from surgery ( 29 ,  30 ,  31 ).
Just 6 medium oysters (59 grams) provides over 300% of the Daily Value (DV) for  zinc  ( 32 ).

10. Sweet potatoes
Eating  healthy high carb foods , such as sweet potatoes, is important for recovery. Carbs not only provide the energy your cells require for healing but also enzymes like hexokinase and citrate synthase, which aid wound repair ( 33 ).
In fact, inadequate carb intake may impair wound healing and delay recovery ( 34 ).
Sweet potatoes  are nutritious carb sources that are packed with anti-inflammatory plant compounds, vitamins, and minerals — including vitamin C, carotenoids, and manganese — that may optimize immune response and help your body recover ( 35 ).

Other ways to help your body heal
In addition to following a healthy diet full of nutrient-dense foods, other lifestyle modifications may support healing.
Rest is essential when recovering from an illness, injury, or surgery. Plus,  getting enough sleep  bolsters your body’s repair process.
In fact, lack of sleep may harm immune function and delay recovery ( 36 ,  37 ).
Hydration is also important for every aspect of healing and recovery, especially proper wound care. Plus, illnesses that involve fever and diarrhea may increase your hydration needs ( 38 ,  39 ).
Additionally, you should steer clear of cigarettes and alcohol when recuperating from illness or injury. Smoking and drinking can delay recovery, impair wound healing, and suppress your immune system ( 40 ,  41 ,  42 ,  43 ).
Deficiencies in zinc and vitamins B12 and A may likewise hamper recovery. Talk to your healthcare provider if you’re concerned about  nutrient deficiencies  ( 23 ).

The bottom line
When recovering from illness or surgery, you should fuel your body with foods that are high in nutrients and compounds that promote healing.
Salmon , nuts, cruciferous veggies, and several other foods may help optimize recovery.
Getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and avoiding smoking and  alcohol  promote optimal healing as well.
