Title: 7 Simple and Delicious Keto Salads

The ketogenic diet is a very-low-carb, high-fat eating method that’s popular for weight loss.
It typically involves limiting carb intake to 20–50 grams per day to stimulate ketosis — a metabolic state in which your body starts using ketones for energy instead of glucose ( 1 ).
However, because it can be restrictive, you may wonder what salads you can eat on a keto diet. Notably, keto salads should be low in carbs but high in healthy fats and protein.
Here are 7 simple and delicious keto salads, plus recipes.

1. Grilled chicken salad
This grilled chicken salad is not only high in protein but also a great source of  healthy fats  like oleic acid from its olives, extra virgin olive oil, and avocado.
Numerous test-tube and animal studies link oleic acid to reduced inflammation, enhanced immunity, and potential anticancer effects ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
Ingredients  (serves two) ( 6 ):
1/2 pound (225 grams) of  chicken thigh , grilled, sliced
4 cups (200 grams) of romaine lettuce, chopped
1/4 cup (60 grams) of cherry tomatoes, chopped
1/2 of a medium cucumber, thinly sliced
1/2 of a medium avocado, sliced
1 ounce (28 grams) of feta cheese, crumbled
1 ounce (28 grams) of olives, pitted, sliced
2 tablespoons (30 ml) of red wine vinegar
3 tablespoons (45 ml) of extra virgin olive oil
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1 teaspoon of fresh thyme
Salt and pepper to taste
Instructions:
Coat the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic, and thyme.
Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until brown. Once cooked thoroughly, remove the chicken from heat.
In a large bowl, arrange the  lettuce , cherry tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, and olives as desired. Once the chicken has cooled, add it to the salad.
Drizzle with red wine vinegar and additional olive oil if desired.

3. Easy pesto-baked salmon salad

Salmon  is one of the best sources of the omega-3 fats EPA and DHA. These fatty acids are considered essential because your body cannot create them, meaning that they must come from your diet.
Studies link EPA and DHA to health benefits, including reduced inflammation, heart disease risk, and cancer risk ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ,  12 ).
Ingredients  (serves two) ( 6 ):
1/2 pound (225 grams) of salmon or two 4-ounce (225-gram) salmon fillets

Bake the salmon for 15–20 minutes, or until it flakes easily.
While the salmon is baking, sauté the spinach in a pan with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil for 2 minutes, or until the leaves have wilted.

Ingredients to avoid
The keto diet typically restricts carb intake to 20–50 grams per day to reach and maintain  ketosis  ( 1 ).
Thus, your keto salad should limit carb-rich foods, instead incorporating healthy, high-fat ingredients. High-carb items to avoid include ( 6 ):
Fruit:  most fruit, except avocados
Dried fruit:  all dried fruit, including raisins, dates, and prunes
Bread and grains:  rice, farro, quinoa, bulgur, croutons, and more
Legumes:  beans, peas, chickpeas, peanuts, and others
Starchy vegetables:  potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, yams, and more
Pasta:  all types of wheat-based pasta
High-sugar add-ins:  candied nuts, jam
Certain dressings:  low-fat, fat-free, and/or sweet dressings like honey mustard
To increase the fat content of your salad, simply drizzle your salad with  olive oil  or avocado oil. You can also add healthy, high-fat toppings like avocado or cheese.
Avoid ingredients like croutons, pasta, fruit, and starchy vegetables in your keto salad, as they’re too high in carbs.

The bottom line
The  keto diet  restricts carb intake to promote weight loss through ketosis.
Although it limits several food groups, you can still create delicious salads using keto-friendly ingredients and  dressings .
If you’re interested in this diet, try incorporating a few of these salads into your routine.
