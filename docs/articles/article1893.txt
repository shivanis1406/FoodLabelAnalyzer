Calcium is an important mineral that’s crucial for  maintaining  bone strength and structure.
What’s more, it’s involved in many other aspects of health and is  required  for blood clotting, muscle contractions, and nerve cell function.
While it’s recommended to meet your calcium needs through your diet from foods like dairy products, nuts, seeds, and leafy greens, some people may need additional help from a supplement to ensure adequate intake.
Selecting a high quality calcium supplement can be challenging, especially if you’re not sure what to look for.
Keep reading for our picks of the best calcium supplements, along with tips for how to choose the right supplement for your needs.
There are several different forms of calcium available, each of which contains varying amounts of elemental calcium (or the amount of calcium that’s actually used by the body).
Calcium carbonate  is one of the  most common , least expensive, and readily available forms. Calcium citrate is another common type found in supplements, which is less dependent on stomach acid to absorb and therefore less likely to cause digestive issues.
Other types of calcium supplements that are available  include :
calcium sulfate
calcium ascorbate
calcium microcrystalline hydroxyapatite
calcium gluconate
calcium lactate
calcium phosphate

It’s also gluten-free, vegan, and third-party tested, which can help ensure that you’re getting the highest quality possible.

A comparison of the best calcium supplements
Here’s a quick look at how our top picks compare:

How we chose
This article evaluates calcium supplements based on the following criteria:
Quality:  We looked for products from reputable companies that have ideally been third-party tested or manufactured by third-party certified facilities.
Type of calcium:  We prioritized supplements that feature forms of calcium that are easy to absorb.
Dosage:  We included supplements that provide a range of doses to help you find a product that meets your needs.
Additional ingredients:  Many of our picks pair calcium with other nutrients to support bone health or maximize absorption, such as vitamin D, vitamin K, or magnesium.
Vetting:  All products included in this article have been vetted and approved by our team of experts to ensure that they meet Healthline’s medical and business standards.
Every brand and product on our list has been reviewed by registered dietitians and  vetted  to ensure that it aligns with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being. Each product in this article:
adheres to allowable health claims and labeling requirements, per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations
is manufactured in facilities that adhere to current good manufacturing practices established by the FDA
is produced by a medically credible company that follows ethical, legal, and industry best standards
is made by a company that provides objective measures of trust, such as having its supplements validated by third-party labs

How to choose
With so many supplements on the market, picking the right product can be challenging.
Here are a few of the most important factors to consider:
Extensive testing:  In addition to buying supplements from a reputable manufacturer, be sure to look for products that have undergone testing to ensure purity and potency, ideally by a third-party lab.
Type:  Calcium carbonate is more widely available and cheaper, and it  contains  a higher amount of calcium. But it  may cause  gas and bloating. Calcium citrate is more expensive but more easily absorbed in the body, which may be key for people who have low stomach acid or are taking  proton pump inhibitors .
Ingredients:  It’s important to check the ingredient label carefully and steer clear of products that contain high amounts of fillers, additives,  artificial sweeteners , and preservatives. Many products also contain added ingredients like vitamin D, which can help  optimize  the absorption of calcium.
Dosage:  Though calcium requirements range from  1,000 mg to 1,300 mg  daily for most adults, supplements with 200 mg to 500 mg are usually enough to help fill in the gaps in your diet. However, some people may need a higher amount,  including  those with certain dietary restrictions or health conditions.
Note that it’s important to only use supplements as directed and to talk with a healthcare professional before trying them, especially if you have any underlying conditions or are taking medications.
Additionally, always talk with your healthcare professional before using a high dose calcium supplement, and remember to split supplementation into several smaller doses of less than 500 mg to  maximize  absorption.

Benefits of calcium
Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body and is essential for maintaining bone strength. In fact, about  98%  of the calcium found in the body is stored in the bones.
Calcium is also involved in several other important functions in the body, including:
nerve transmission
hormone secretion
blood clotting
blood vessel contraction
muscle function
Getting enough calcium in your diet through foods or supplements might offer several potential health benefits.
For example,  one study  of over 7,300 people under age 35 found that calcium supplementation was tied to increased bone mass.
According to another review, each 300 mg increase in daily calcium consumption was linked to a  6%  lower risk of developing colorectal cancer.
Other research  suggests  that calcium may even aid weight loss by altering the absorption and metabolism of fat, though more studies are needed.

Potential risks and side effects
Though  calcium  is an essential mineral and plays a central role in bone health, excessive intake of calcium from supplements has been associated with several negative side effects, including:
increased risk  of kidney stones, especially when combined with vitamin D or if supplements are taken between meals rather than with food
higher risk  of heart disease and heart attack
hypercalcemia , or high levels of calcium in the blood, which can cause a range of symptoms,  including  digestive issues and bone pain
If you’re considering taking calcium supplements, talk with a healthcare professional first to determine whether the potential benefits outweigh the risks.
Not getting enough calcium  can increase  the risk of developing osteoporosis, a condition that causes the bones to become weak and brittle.
Calcium deficiency may also contribute to other bone disorders like rickets, which causes the softening of the bones in children.
In many cases, low levels of calcium may not cause any symptoms. However, calcium deficiency has been linked to a wide range of health issues, some of which can be serious. These include:
numbness in the mouth
tingling of the hands or feet
muscle spasms
kidney problems
calcium deposits
cataracts
congestive heart failure
depression

Who should take calcium supplements
Calcium supplements  can be a simple and effective way to increase your calcium intake.
They may be especially beneficial for certain groups, including:
those who are unable to meet their calcium needs through  food sources  alone
people with health conditions that can interfere with nutrient absorption
postmenopausal people, as menopause  can lead  to bone loss and decreased calcium absorption
those concerned about bone loss, as adequate calcium intake is  recommended  to maintain bone health and  decrease  bone density loss during menopause
It’s important to talk with a healthcare professional before taking calcium supplements to determine whether they are necessary for you.

Frequently asked questions
There are several forms of calcium available, each of which has its own pros and cons.
Calcium citrate is  often preferred  over other types because it’s more readily absorbed and less likely to cause side effects.
On the other hand, calcium carbonate may be associated with gas and bloating, but it’s also more affordable, readily available, and requires fewer tablets per serving to reach your desired dose.
Other forms are also available but are less common and have not been studied as extensively, including calcium phosphate, calcium ascorbate, and dicalcium malate.

Vitamin D and calcium are two different nutrients. Calcium is a mineral  found naturally  in dairy products and leafy greens. Meanwhile, vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that’s  produced  by the skin in response to sun exposure.
Though there are several differences between these two nutrients, both play a key role in bone health and are often combined in many supplements.

The bottom line
Calcium is an important mineral that plays a central role in bone health.
While its best to meet your calcium needs through  food , some people may benefit from also taking a supplement.
There are many calcium supplements on the market, each of which varies based on the type of calcium, dosage, and ingredients it contains.
When selecting a calcium supplement, be sure to consider all of these factors and look for products that have undergone third-party testing to ensure that you’re getting the highest quality possible.
