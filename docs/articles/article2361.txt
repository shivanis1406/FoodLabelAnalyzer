Title: The 12 Best Casein Protein Powders

Casein  is the most predominant type of protein in milk. In fact, it represents about 80% of milk’s total protein content ( 1 ).
It’s widely used as a pre-sleep protein supplement because it’s a more slowly digested protein source, which may allow for increases in overnight muscle protein synthesis and help prevent muscle degradation while you sleep ( 2 ,  3 ).
Two forms of casein are commonly found in casein supplements: micellar casein, which is milk’s natural casein form, and sodium, potassium, or calcium caseinates, which are more rapidly digested.
Aside from being a more natural form of casein, micellar casein has traditionally been preferred over caseinates because of its slower digestion rate, which sustains blood amino acid concentrations overnight. However, the research is mixed ( 4 ).

Comparison of the best casein protein powders
Here’s a quick look at how our top picks compare:

How to choose a casein protein powder
There are several factors to consider when shopping for a casein protein supplement:
Third-party testing:  Choosing a casein protein powder that has been third-party tested is the best way to ensure purity and potency. While third-party testing doesn’t guarantee product safety, it does help ensure that the label accurately reflects the contents.
Safe for sport:  Competitive athletes should choose a product that’s Informed Sport certified or NSF Certified for Sport to ensure that the supplement is free from substances that are banned by most sporting organizations ( 20 ).
Form of casein:  If you’re looking for a protein powder that digests slowly, it may be worth choosing one with micellar casein. While results are mixed, some research suggests that micellar casein is more slowly digested than other forms of casein, though processing and storage may greatly impact the rate of digestibility ( 4 ).
Presence of additives:  Casein powders vary widely in composition. Some may contain food  additives  or other ingredients, such as added sugars, probiotics, or artificial sweeteners. Consider these ingredients in the context of your diet as a whole.
Quantity of protein:  Check the grams of protein per serving of casein, as this can vary among brands. Research suggests that a dose of at least 30 grams of casein is optimal for muscle growth ( 2 ,  21 ).
Calorie content:  Casein supplements vary widely in total calorie content. Choose a supplement that best fits your calorie needs and weight goals.

Benefits of casein protein powder
The primary  benefit of casein  protein powder supplements is to provide a source of protein that’s easy to consume.
Casein supplements are often marked as being beneficial for muscle repair and recovery when taken before bed. However, the overnight benefits of casein have recently been called into question.
A recent study of resistance-trained men found that pre-sleep casein supplementation did not enhance muscle recovery but did reduce feelings of hunger the morning after supplementation ( 22 ).
“While this study was a small and short duration study, it certainly points to the limited benefits of casein before bed,” explains  Dr. Rachele Pojednic , PhD, assistant professor and program director of exercise science at Norwich University.
Despite this, Pojednic says there is still a benefit to taking casein: “Casein has an excellent essential amino acid profile, is highly digestible, and is still a great source of overall protein.”
While research is mixed on the benefits of casein for muscle protein synthesis, casein can still offer all the benefits  protein provides . “Protein is essential for life and critically important for physiologic functions outside of muscle protein synthesis,” explains Pojednic.
In addition to being an excellent source of protein, casein is a good source of BCAAs.
“The BCAAs, particularly leucine, have been shown to be critically important for muscle protein synthesis,” Pojednic says.
Still, keep in mind that leucine needs to be paired with a regular resistance training regimen for optimal effectiveness.
Additionally, taking BCAAs alone is not as effective as consuming BCAAs along with all the essential amino acids.
“When examining the BCAAs in isolation compared to complete proteins such as whey or casein, those that contain all of the EAAs have much more beneficial and synergistic effects overall,” says Pojednic.
This is another reason that choosing a casein protein powder is more beneficial than taking BCAAs alone.

Potential side effects
Casein protein powders are generally considered safe. However, the FDA does not regulate the safety, quality, and accuracy of supplements as strictly as it does for other products, such as pharmaceuticals.
Third-party testing is the most important consideration when choosing any supplement to ensure that the product contains what is listed on the label and is free of other contaminates.
Concerns have also been raised about heavy metal presence in protein powders. A study by the Clean Label Project found that 40% of the 134 protein powders tested contained high levels of heavy metals ( 23 ).
However, these results were called into question, and further investigation found that the amounts of heavy metals in the protein powders tested do not pose a risk to human health in quantities normally consumed ( 24 ,  25 ).
As is the case in much of nutrition science, more isn’t always better when it comes to nutrients.
While there is limited research on the effect of taking casein in excess, some research suggests that general protein intake in excess of daily needs does not provide a benefit to muscle protein synthesis or recovery ( 26 ).
Finally, keep in mind that some people do have  casein allergies , which can result in symptoms such as hives and vomiting.

Frequently asked questions
Casein protein powder is generally considered safe for healthy adults.
However, people who are currently taking medications, have a medical condition, or are pregnant or nursing should talk with a healthcare professional before taking any new supplements.
Casein protein powder could lead to weight gain if adding it to your diet causes you to regularly consume more calories than you burn.
However, simply consuming casein protein powder is unlikely to cause weight gain on its own.
Any protein consumed in excess, including casein, will be stored as fat or excreted depending on total energy needs and daily intake.
Additionally, casein protein powder is not intended to act as a weight loss supplement or meal replacement. Therefore, there’s a potential risk of nutrient deficiencies if you’re regularly consuming casein supplements in place of nutrient-rich foods.

The bottom line
Casein is a slowly digested protein that may allow your body to repair your muscles while you sleep, which could promote muscle recovery.
Milk and other dairy products contain varying amounts of casein. If you’re looking for a whole-food source of casein, drinking milk may be the easiest and least expensive way to add it to your diet.
Pojednic also recommends an unexpected source of casein: cheese.
“Casein is the protein that causes milk to produce curds, the precursor to making cheese,” she says. “So, if you want an all-natural source of casein you can carry with you as a snack, just go find those yummy, salty, squeaky cheese curds in the dairy aisle!”
If you’re looking to add casein via a casein protein powder, make sure to choose a product that meets your specific preferences and needs regarding flavor, quality, and calorie content.
