Title: Can Dark Chocolate Help You Lose Weight?

Thanks to  dark chocolate ‘s content of beneficial compounds like polyphenols, flavanols, and catechins, it’s often hailed as a health food ( 1 ).
In fact, it has been linked to a number of health benefits, including improved heart health, decreased inflammation, and enhanced brain function ( 2 ).
Due to its recent superfood status, many people also wonder whether dark chocolate may aid weight loss.
This article takes a closer look at the research to determine whether dark chocolate can help you lose weight.

Potential benefits
Dark chocolate may offer several potential benefits when it comes to weight loss.
Some research suggests that dark chocolate could help improve your body’s  sensitivity to insulin , the hormone responsible for shuttling sugar out of your bloodstream and into your cells where it can be used for energy ( 3 ).
This can help decrease levels of insulin in the blood, which may be associated with increased weight loss and reduced fat storage ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ).
Although more research is needed, some small studies have also found that dark chocolate may help improve blood sugar control ( 7 ,  8 ).
This may help prevent spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels, which can lead to symptoms like increased hunger ( 9 ).
Studies show that dark chocolate may  reduce cravings  and promote feelings of fullness, which may help support weight loss.
In one study in 12 women, smelling and eating dark chocolate decreased appetite and reduced levels of ghrelin, the hormone that stimulates hunger ( 10 ).
Another small study in 16 people compared the effects of milk chocolate and dark chocolate and found that participants felt less hungry and more full and satisfied after eating dark chocolate ( 11 ).
Furthermore, they also consumed 17% fewer calories at a subsequent meal, compared with participants who ate milk chocolate ( 11 ).
Similarly, a study in 14 postmenopausal women showed that consuming dark chocolate led to greater reductions in food intake, compared with eating white and milk chocolate ( 12 ).
Still, more research is needed to evaluate how dark chocolate may affect appetite and food intake, compared with other foods.
Several studies have found that dark chocolate may positively affect mental health and mood, which can ensure that you feel your very best to help promote weight loss ( 13 ).
According to one study in 13,626 people, those who consumed higher amounts of dark chocolate had 57% lower odds of experiencing depressive symptoms than those who did not regularly consume dark chocolate ( 14 ).
In another small study, eating 1.5 ounces (40 grams) of dark chocolate daily  reduced stress levels  in women over 2 weeks ( 15 ).
What’s more, a study in 72 adults showed that consuming a dark chocolate drink for 30 days led to increased feelings of self-rated calmness and contentedness, compared with a placebo ( 16 ).
Additional research is needed to determine whether the potential  mood-boosting benefits  of dark chocolate may be beneficial for weight loss.
Dark chocolate may help improve insulin sensitivity, reduce hunger and appetite, and enhance mood — all of which may help promote weight loss.

Possible downsides
Although dark chocolate may offer some potential benefits for weight loss, there are several downsides to consider.
First, dark chocolate is relatively high in fat and calories.
In fact, a 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of dark chocolate contains 155 calories and nearly 9 grams of fat ( 17 ).
Depending on the specific brand and product, a single serving may contain one-half to one-third the number of calories in a standard chocolate bar.
Some types of dark chocolate also contain high amounts of  added sugar , which can harm your health.
In addition to increasing the number of calories in a product, added sugar may contribute to chronic health conditions like liver disease, heart disease, and diabetes ( 18 ).
Therefore, while dark chocolate can likely fit into a weight loss diet, it’s important to stick to  high quality varieties  and avoid going overboard.
For best results, stick to around 1 ounce (28 grams) at a time and pick a product that’s low in added sugar and contains at least 70% cocoa.
Dark chocolate is high in calories and fat, which may contribute to weight gain if consumed in excess. Some types also contain high amounts of added sugar, which can increase the calorie count and contribute to chronic disease.

The bottom line
Dark chocolate may aid  weight loss  through several mechanisms, such as by improving insulin sensitivity, reducing hunger and appetite, and enhancing mood.
However, it’s important to keep in mind that dark chocolate is also high in calories and fat, and many varieties contain high amounts of added sugar.
For this reason, it’s best to select high quality products that are low in added sugar and contain at least 70% cocoa, as well as enjoy it in moderation as part of a healthy, well-rounded diet.
Fortunately, dark chocolate can be purchased in bite-sized, individually wrapped pieces, which might help promote portion control.
