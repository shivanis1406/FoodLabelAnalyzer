Title: What Is Coconut Meat, and Does It Have Benefits?

Coconut meat is rich in fiber and MCTs (medium-chain triglycerides). Consuming it may offer a number of benefits, including improved digestion, heart health, and weight loss.
Coconut meat is the white flesh inside a coconut.
Coconuts are the large seeds of coconut palms ( Cocos nucifera ), which grow in tropical climates. Their brown, fibrous husks conceal the meat inside.
As the oil and milk from this fruit have become increasingly popular, many people may wonder how to use coconut meat and whether it offers health benefits.
This article tells you everything you need to know about coconut meat.

Nutrition facts
Coconut meat is high in fat and calories while moderate in carbs and protein.
The nutrition facts for 1 cup (80 grams) of fresh, shredded coconut meat are ( 1 ):
Calories:  283
Protein:  3 grams
Carbs:  10 grams
Fat:  27 grams
Sugar:  5 grams
Fiber:  7 grams
Manganese:  60% of the Daily Value (DV)
Selenium:  15% of the DV
Copper:  44% of the DV
Phosphorus:  13% of the DV
Potassium:  6% of the DV
Iron:  11% of the DV
Zinc:  10% of the DV
Coconut meat is rich in several important minerals, especially  manganese  and copper. While manganese supports enzyme function and fat metabolism,  copper  assists bone formation and heart health ( 2 ,  3 ).
Coconut is a unique fruit because of its high fat content. Around 89% of the fat in its meat is  saturated  ( 4 ).
Most of these fats are medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which are absorbed intact in your small intestine and used by your body to produce energy ( 5 ).
Just 1 cup (80 grams) of shredded coconut provides 7 grams of  fiber , which is over 20% of the DV ( 6 ).
Most of this fiber is insoluble, meaning that it doesn’t get digested. Instead, it works to move food through your digestive system and aids bowel health.
Coconut meat is particularly high in calories, saturated fat, and fiber. It also contains a variety of minerals, including manganese, copper, selenium, phosphorus, potassium, and iron.

Health benefits of coconut meat
Coconut meat may benefit your health in a number of ways.
Much of the research on the benefits of this tropical fruit is focused on its fat content.
Coconut meat contains coconut oil, which may boost HDL (good) cholesterol and reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol. Improvements in these markers may reduce your risk of  heart disease  ( 7 ).
One 4-week study gave 91 people 1.6 ounces (50 ml) of either extra virgin coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil, or unsalted butter daily. Those in the coconut-oil group showed a significant increase in HDL (good) cholesterol, compared with those given butter or olive oil ( 8 ).
An 8-week study in 35 healthy adults showed similar results, finding that 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of  coconut oil  taken twice daily led to a significant increase in HDL cholesterol, compared with the control group ( 9 ).
Another 8-week study noted that people who consumed 7 ounces (200 grams) of porridge made with coconut milk had significant reductions in LDL (bad) cholesterol and increases in HDL (good) cholesterol compared with those who ate porridge made with soy milk ( 10 ).
Coconut meat may aid weight loss.
Studies suggest that the MCTs in this fruit may promote feelings of fullness, calorie burning, and  fat burning , all of which may support weight loss ( 11 ,  12 ,  13 ).
Additionally, the high fiber content of coconut meat can boost fullness, which may help prevent overeating ( 14 ,  15 ).
A 90-day study in 8 adults found that supplementing a standard diet with 1.3 cups (100 grams) of fresh coconut daily caused significant weight loss, compared with supplementing with the same amount of peanuts or  peanut oil  ( 16 ).
Keep in mind that these studies use very large amounts of coconut and MCT oil, so it’s unclear if eating smaller amounts of coconut meat would have the same effects.
Coconuts are high in fiber, which helps bulk up your stool and supports bowel regularity, keeping your  digestive system  healthy ( 6 ,  17 ).
Since these fruits are likewise high in fat, they can help your body absorb fat-soluble nutrients, including vitamins A, D, E, and K.
Additionally, the MCTs in coconut meat have been shown to strengthen your  gut bacteria , which may protect against inflammation and conditions like metabolic syndrome ( 18 ).
What’s more, coconut oil may reduce the growth of harmful yeasts, such as  Candida albicans , which can cause serious infections ( 19 ).
Eating coconut meat may have other benefits, including the following:
May stabilize blood sugar.  This fruit may lower your fasting  blood sugar  and alter your gut bacteria to aid blood sugar control ( 20 ,  21 ,  22 ).
May improve immunity.  Manganese and antioxidants in coconut may help boost your immune system and  reduce inflammation . This fruit’s MCTs may also have antiviral, antifungal, and tumor-suppressing properties ( 23 ,  24 ,  25 ,  26 ).
May benefit your brain.  The MCTs in coconut oil provide an alternative fuel source to glucose, which may aid people with impaired memory or brain function, such as those with Alzheimer’s disease ( 27 ,  28 ).
The MCTs and fiber in coconut meat may benefit weight loss, heart health, digestion, brain health, blood sugar levels, and immunity.

Potential downsides
While coconut meat has multiple benefits, it may also have downsides.
It contains a significant amount of saturated fat, which is highly controversial.
A study in over 115,000 healthy adults found that high saturated fat intake was associated with an increased risk of heart disease ( 29 ).
While the effects of saturated fat on heart disease is still debated, studies show that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats may lower heart disease risk ( 30 ).
Some scientists argue that although coconuts don’t seem to damage heart health, most people don’t eat enough to experience any negative effects — especially on a Western diet ( 31 ).
Given that this fruit may also have positive effects on your heart, more research is needed on coconut meat and long-term heart health.
Notably, coconut meat is also  calorie-dense . Overeating it may lead to unwanted weight gain if you don’t restrict calories elsewhere.
Lastly, some people may react severely to coconut. Still, coconut  allergies  are rare and not always associated with other nut allergies ( 32 ).
Coconuts are high in saturated fat, a controversial fat that may be harmful if consumed in high amounts. What’s more, coconut meat packs quite a few calories, and some people may be allergic to it.

How to use coconut meat
Coconut meat can be purchased in many forms, including frozen, shredded, or dried.
In certain places, you can even purchase whole coconuts. You’ll need to pierce its soft spots — or eyes — with a hammer and nail, then drain the milk, after which you can break the husk. Remove the meat with a spoon if it’s soft or a knife if it’s firm.
Some ways to use coconut meat include:
shredding it to add to fruit salad, mixed greens,  yogurt , or oatmeal
blending it into smoothies, dips, and sauces
combining it with breadcrumbs to coat meat,  fish , poultry, or tofu before baking
drying it to add to homemade trail mix
stirring fresh chunks of coconut into stir-fries, stews, or cooked grains
Many dried and prepackaged coconut products are heavily sweetened, which significantly increases the  sugar content .
One cup (80 grams) of fresh, unsweetened coconut contains only 5 grams of sugar, whereas 1 cup (93 grams) of sweetened, shredded coconut packs a whopping 34 grams ( 4 ,  33 ).
Thus, unsweetened or  raw  products are healthiest.
Both fresh and dried coconut meat can be used in a variety of dishes, such as cooked grains, smoothies, and oatmeal. Look for unsweetened or raw products to minimize your sugar intake.

The bottom line
Coconut meat is the white flesh of coconuts and is edible fresh or dried.
Rich in fiber and  MCTs , it may offer a number of benefits, including improved heart health,  weight loss , and digestion. Yet, it’s high in calories and saturated fat, so you should eat it in moderation.
Overall, unsweetened coconut meat makes a great addition to a balanced diet.
