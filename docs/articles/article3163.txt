Title: Whole-Foods, Plant-Based Diet: A Detailed Beginner's Guide

Whole-foods, plant-based diets prioritize plant foods and minimize processed ingredients and animal products. This eating pattern is environmentally friendly and may be associated with several health benefits.
There are many arguments about which diet is best for you.
Nevertheless, health and wellness communities agree that diets emphasizing fresh, whole ingredients and minimizing processed foods are superior for overall wellness.
The whole-foods, plant-based diet does just that.
It focuses on minimally processed foods and prioritizes plants. Studies show that plant-based diets are effective at stimulating weight loss and improving health ( 1 ,  2 ).
This article reviews everything you need to know about the whole-foods, plant-based diet, including its potential health benefits, foods to eat, and a sample meal plan.

What is a whole-foods, plant-based diet?
There is no clear definition of a what constitutes a whole-foods, plant-based diet (WFPB diet). The WFPB diet is not necessarily a set diet — it’s more of a lifestyle.
This is because plant-based diets can vary greatly depending on the extent to which a person includes animal products in their diet.
Nonetheless, the basic principles of a whole-foods, plant-based diet are as follows:
emphasizes whole, minimally processed foods
limits or avoids animal products
focuses on plants, including vegetables, fruits,  whole grains , legumes, seeds, and nuts, which should make up the majority of what you eat
excludes refined foods, like  added sugars , white flour, and processed oils
pays special attention to food quality, with many proponents of the WFPB diet promoting locally sourced, organic food whenever possible
For these reasons, this diet is often confused with  vegan or vegetarian diets . Yet although similar in some ways, these diets are not the same.
People who follow vegan diets abstain from consuming any animal products, including dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, and honey. Vegetarians exclude all meat and poultry from their diets, but some vegetarians eat eggs, seafood, or dairy ( 3 ).
The WFPB diet, on the other hand, is more flexible. Followers eat mostly plants, but animal products aren’t off limits.
While one person following a WFPB diet may eat no animal products, another may eat small amounts of eggs, poultry, seafood, meat, or dairy.
The whole-foods, plant-based diet emphasizes plant-based foods while minimizing animal products and processed items.

It can help you lose weight and improve your health
Obesity is an issue of epidemic proportions. In fact, it’s estimated that nearly 31% of adults have overweight, while over 42% have obesity ( 4 ).
Fortunately, making dietary and lifestyle changes can facilitate  weight loss  and have a lasting impact on health.
Many studies have shown that plant-based diets are beneficial for weight loss.
The high fiber content of the WFPB diet, along with the exclusion of  processed foods , is a winning combination for shedding excess pounds.
A review of 12 studies that included more than 1,100 people found that those assigned to plant-based diets lost significantly more weight — about 4.5 pounds (lbs), or 2 kilograms (kg), over an average of 18 weeks — than those assigned to non-vegetarian diets ( 5 ).
Adopting a healthy plant-based eating pattern may also help  keep weight off  in the long run.
A study in 65 people with overweight or obesity found that those assigned to a WFPB diet lost significantly more weight than the control group and were able to sustain that weight loss of 25 lbs (11.5 kg) over a 1-year follow-up period ( 6 ).
However, it’s unclear whether the control group received nutrition advice or made any changes to their diet ( 6 ).
Regardless, simply cutting out the processed foods that aren’t allowed on a WFPB diet like soda, candy, fast food, and  refined grains  is a powerful weight loss tool itself ( 7 ,  8 ).
Many studies have demonstrated that whole-food, plant-based diets are effective for weight loss. They may also help you maintain weight loss in the long run.

It benefits a number of health conditions
Adopting a whole-foods, plant-based diet not only benefits your waistline, but it can also lower your risk and reduce symptoms of certain chronic diseases.
Perhaps one of the most well-known benefits of WFPB diets is that they are  heart-healthy .
However, the quality and types of foods included in the diet matter.
A large study in over 200,000 people found that those who followed a healthy plant-based diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains,  legumes , and nuts had a significantly lower risk of developing heart disease than those following non-plant-based diets ( 9 ).
However, less nutritious plant-based diets that included sugary drinks, fruit juices, and refined grains were associated with a slightly increased risk of heart disease ( 9 ).
Similarly, several other studies suggest that people following a healthy plant-based diet may have a lower risk of heart disease compared to meat eaters ( 10 ,  11 ).
Consuming the right kinds of food is critical for heart disease prevention when following a plant-based diet, which is why adhering to a WFPB diet is the best choice.
Research suggests that following a plant-based diet may reduce your risk of certain types of  cancer .
A study in over 76,000 people found that following a healthy plant-based diet could be associated with a lower risk of breast cancer ( 12 ).
Similarly, another recent study showed that greater consumption of nutritious plant-based foods was linked to a lower risk of aggressive forms of prostate cancer, especially in men under 65 years ( 13 ).
Furthermore, a 2022 review concluded that plant-based diets could be tied to a lower risk of digestive system cancers, including pancreatic, colon, rectal, and colorectal cancers ( 14 ).
Some studies suggest that diets rich in vegetables and fruits may help slow or prevent cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease in older adults.
Plant-based diets have a higher number of plant compounds and  antioxidants , which may help slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease and reverse cognitive deficits, according to some test-tube and animal studies ( 15 ).
In many studies, higher intakes of fruits and vegetables have been strongly associated with a reduction in cognitive decline.
A review of nine studies including over 31,000 people found that eating more fruits and vegetables led to a 20% reduction in the risk of developing cognitive impairment or dementia ( 16 ).
Other studies in older adults have found that plant-based eating patterns may be associated with a reduced risk of cognitive impairment, along with a slower decline in brain function ( 17 ,  18 ).
Adopting a WFPB diet may be an effective tool in managing and reducing your risk of developing  diabetes .
A study in more than 200,000 people found that those who adhered to a healthy plant-based eating pattern had a 34% lower risk of developing diabetes than those who followed unhealthy, non-plant-based diets ( 19 ).
Another study demonstrated that plant-based diets could be beneficial for the prevention of type 2 diabetes, especially when they included nutritious plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes ( 20 ).
Plus, plant-based diets have been shown to  improve blood sugar control , body weight, and cholesterol levels in people with diabetes ( 21 ).
Following a whole-foods, plant-based diet may reduce your risk of developing heart disease, certain cancers, cognitive decline, and diabetes.

Adopting a whole-foods, plant-based diet is good for the planet
Switching to a plant-based diet not only benefits your health — it can help protect the environment, as well.
People who follow plant-based diets may have smaller environmental footprints.
Adopting sustainable eating habits can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption and land used for factory farming, which are all factors in global warming and environmental degradation.
A review of 63 studies showed that the largest environmental benefits were seen from diets containing the least amount of animal-based foods such as vegan, vegetarian, and  pescatarian diets .
The study reported that a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and land use and 50% less water use could be achieved by shifting Western diet patterns to more sustainable, plant-based dietary patterns ( 22 ).
What’s more, reducing the number of animal products in your diet and purchasing local, sustainable produce helps drive the local economy and reduces reliance on factory farming, an unsustainable method of food production ( 23 ).
Plant-based diets emphasizing local ingredients are more environmentally friendly than diets that rely heavily on mass-produced animal products and produce.

Foods to eat on a whole-foods, plant-based diet
From eggs and bacon for breakfast to steak for dinner, animal products are the focus of most meals for many people.
When switching to a plant-based diet, meals should center around plant-based foods.
If animal foods are eaten, they should be eaten in smaller quantities, with attention paid to the quality of the item.
Foods like dairy, eggs, poultry, meat and seafood should be used more as a complement to a plant-based meal, not as the main focal point.
Fruits:  berries, citrus fruits, pears, peaches, pineapple, bananas, etc.
Vegetables:  kale, spinach, tomatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, asparagus, peppers, etc.
Starchy vegetables:  potatoes, sweet potatoes,  butternut squash , etc.
Whole grains:  brown rice, rolled oats, farro, quinoa, brown rice pasta, barley, etc.
Healthy fats:  avocados, olive oil, unsweetened coconut, etc.
Legumes:  peas, chickpeas, lentils, peanuts, black beans, etc.
Seeds, nuts and nut butters:  almonds, cashews,  macadamia nuts , pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, natural peanut butter, tahini, etc.
Unsweetened plant-based milks:  coconut milk, almond milk, cashew milk, etc.
Spices, herbs and seasonings:  basil, rosemary, turmeric, curry, black pepper, salt, etc.
Condiments:  salsa, mustard, nutritional yeast, soy sauce, vinegar, lemon juice, etc.
Plant-based protein:  tofu, tempeh,  plant-based protein  sources or powders with no added sugar or artificial ingredients
Beverages:  coffee, tea, sparkling water, etc.
If supplementing your plant-based diet with animal products, choose quality products from grocery stores or, better yet, purchase them from local farms.
Examples of animal products that can be enjoyed in moderation include:
eggs
poultry
beef
pork
seafood
dairy products
While you can consume conventional animal products, some people may choose pasture-raised, grass-fed, wild-caught, or  organic products  for environmental reasons or personal preferences.
A healthy, WFPB diet should focus on plant foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. If animal products are eaten, they should be eaten in smaller quantities compared to plant foods.

Foods to avoid or minimize on this diet
The WFPB diet is a way of eating that focuses on consuming foods in their most natural form. This means that heavily processed foods are excluded.
When purchasing groceries, focus on fresh foods and, when purchasing foods with a label, aim for items with the fewest possible ingredients.
Fast food:  French fries, cheeseburgers, hot dogs, chicken nuggets, etc.
Added sugars and sweets:  table sugar,  soda , juice, pastries, cookies, candy, sweet tea, sugary cereals, etc.
Refined grains:  white rice, white pasta, white bread, bagels, etc.
Packaged and convenience foods:  chips, crackers, cereal bars, frozen dinners, etc.
Processed vegan-friendly foods:  plant-based meats like Tofurkey, faux cheeses, vegan butters, etc.
Artificial sweeteners:  Equal, Splenda, Sweet’N Low, etc.
Processed animal products:  b acon , lunch meats, sausage, beef jerky, etc.
While healthy animal foods can be included in a WFPB diet, they should be minimized. These include:
beef
pork
sheep
game meats
poultry
eggs
dairy
seafood
When following a WFPB diet, highly processed foods should be avoided and animal products minimized.
