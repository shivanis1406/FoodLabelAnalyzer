Title: The 6 Best Collagen Supplements for Better Skin, According to a Dietitian

A daily smidgen of collagen could be just the thing for a glow-up. Our dietitian evaluated top products and chose the best collagen for skin health. Here are the supplements that made the list.

So, what type of collagen is best for the skin? Technically, all types of collagen, but if you want to go the extra mile, we recommend choosing a supplement that contains additional ingredients thought to enhance skin health.
We chose five collagen powders and one capsule option after evaluating their ingredients against clinical research and then trying some for ourselves.

But first, what is collagen?
Collagen is a type of protein found throughout your body. It’s in your skin, bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, tissue, and teeth.
Collagen in supplement for is most commonly derived from:
bovine
porcine
marine sources
It can also be made synthetically from insect, yeast, and plant or mammal cultures, resulting in a  lower risk  of allergic reactions. People often use collagen supplements to promote skin health, as this protein has shown  benefits  for skin elasticity, hydration, and texture.
Though bovine collagen is more widely found in supplements, the body absorbs  marine collagen  better, and it’s less inflammatory and contains fewer toxins, according to  research .
Most of our picks contain bovine collagen because it’s more common. However, our  Ancient Nutrition pick  contains marine collagen as well as bovine and other sources.
Additionally,  Anthony’s Marine Collagen  is a former top pick that’s made strictly from marine sources, but we decided not to include it in our main list since it does not contain additional ingredients that benefit skin health. However, it’s a good choice if you want a collagen powder sourced solely from marine sources.
Generally, prices range from $1.33 to $3.50 per serving or $29.99 to $70.00 per container, though this may vary depending on where you shop.
$  = under $0.50 per serving $$  = $0.50 to $1 per serving $$$  = over $1 per serving

Healthline’s picks for the best collagen supplements for better skin

Best overall
Number of servings   14 per container
Dose   2–4 tbsp per day
Active ingredient(s) (serving strength)   collagen peptides 20 g (bovine), hyaluronic acid 80 mg
Price   $$$
Why we picked it:  This collagen supplement is third-party tested. It’s also formulated with ingredients to promote skin health, including vitamin C and hyaluronic acid.
More about it:  Vital Proteins produces many of the most popular collagen supplements on the market.
This collagen supplement is intended to support joints that have been overworked and promote healthy skin and nails.
The collagen in this supplement comes from grass-fed cows and is gluten- and dairy-free. The product also contains vitamin C and hyaluronic acid. Though topical preparations of hyaluronic acid work more quickly, taking hyaluronic acid orally can help  maintain results  in the long term.
With both flavored and unflavored varieties available, there are plenty of ways to add it to your diet. One of our editors uses the chocolate collagen “literally every day” in her coffee and uses the plain flavor for cooking and baking, especially for thickening sauces without using flour. Keto gravy, anyone?
Vital Proteins products are made in an  NSF certified , current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs) compliant facility and are free of:
gluten
dairy
fillers
sweeteners
“I love this product! It’s a staple in my home.
“I make my morning ‘coffee’ with the chocolate flavor, or I use the plain and add a few drops of vanilla-flavored stevia to sweeten it up.
“It’s also a great option for thickening curries, gravies, and soups without flour. Plus, my kiddo doesn’t notice it in his hot chocolate, so he gets some added nutrients instead of all the sugar.”
—  Crystal Hoshaw, Bezzy editor

Best multisource collagen
Number of servings   45 per container
Dose   1 scoop
Active ingredient(s) (serving strength)   hydrolyzed collagen peptides 10 g (bovine, egg shell membrane, chicken bone broth concentrate, fish), bacilus coagluans (2 billion CFU), vitamin C (90 mg)
Price   $$$
Why we picked it:  In addition to providing collagen derived from four sources (which could be more beneficial), this supplement also includes vitamin C and probiotics for an added boost of nutrients. Like our top pick, it’s also third-party tested.
More about it:  Ancient Nutrition Multi Collagen Protein is the only product on our list that features 20 grams (g) of collagen from four sources:
bovine collagen
eggshell membrane
fish
chicken bone broth
Each source contains different types of collagen, which differ in function and potential health effects, so opting for a multisource collagen supplement might be beneficial.
One of the four types is  marine collagen . According to a  2018 review of research , marine collagen is better absorbed, less inflammatory, and contains fewer toxins.
While some online reviews point to an “unsettling” taste and smell, an editor on our team uses it almost daily in her coffee and has found that it’s tasteless and dissolves fully.
Each scoop includes 90 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C — a nutrient that  slows aging  and promotes collagen production — and 2 billion colony forming units (CFU) of  Bacillus coagulans , a type of probiotic.
This product is third-party tested for safety. Plus, Ancient Nutrition offers a certificate of analysis (COA) for each product on its website. The COA provides detailed information about testing results.
“Between the two of us, my husband and I use this collagen powder almost daily in our morning coffee or (occasionally) smoothies, and we have been using it on an off for about 2 years.
“I chose it mostly because it doesn’t have any added flavors or other ingredients like some collagen powders, and it’s proved to be easy to add to coffee without changing the taste or texture of my beloved morning beverage.
“It dissolves completely. I’ll either stir with a spoon to mix it up, sometimes I’ll just scoop it into my cup and have found that if I have to walk away to butter my toast or chase my toddler or what have you, it will completely dissolve on its own after a few minutes.”

These capsules also contain a blend of other ingredients and herbal extracts to support skin health, including:

Why we picked it:  This supplement couples grass-fed collagen with a long list of ingredients that can promote skin health. Though it’s one of the pricier options on our list, it’s high in protein and a variety of vitamins and minerals, meaning it may even help streamline your supplement routine.

While some of these ingredients — such as  vitamin C ,  vitamin E , and  hyaluronic acid  — have been shown to reduce oxidative stress and support skin health,  research is limited  on the effectiveness of others for skin health, including biotin.

How we chose the best collagen powders and supplements
We selected the products featured in this article based on the following criteria:
Type of supplement:  We included collagen supplements in various forms, including powders and capsules.
Ingredients:  We selected collagen supplements made with high quality ingredients, all of which are free of fillers and unnecessary additives.
Third-party testing or certifications:  Many of the products on our list have been tested or certified by a third-party organization to ensure safety and quality.
Dosage:  Most studies have evaluated the effects of collagen at doses of  2.5 to 10 g  per day. We selected collagen supplements available in a wide range of doses so you can adjust based on your needs.

Considerations as you shop for collagen supplements
When selecting a collagen supplement, there are several factors to consider.
First, it’s important to consider the form of supplement.
While some people prefer the ease and convenience of capsules, others enjoy the versatility of collagen powders, which can easily be mixed into beverages and baked goods.
Also check the label to determine the  dosage .
Although there are no established guidelines for how much collagen you should take,  studies  show that 2.5 to 15 g of collagen  peptides  per day are considered safe and effective.
You may also want to read the ingredients label, as some products may contain additional ingredients to support skin health, such as:
silica
hyaluronic acid
vitamin C

Because collagen is derived from animal products, there are no vegan-friendly sources of collagen.
Some  older research  suggests that vegan collagen could be made using genetically modified yeast and bacteria. More studies are needed, though, and vegan collagen supplements are not yet readily available.
However, several vegan-friendly, collagen-boosting supplements are already on the market. These usually contain ingredients that support collagen production, such as vitamin C, but not collagen itself.
Alternatively, you can consume more  vitamin C-rich foods , such as fruits and vegetables, to help naturally promote collagen production.

the type of supplement
additional ingredients
the dosage
whether the product has undergone third-party testing
As with any supplement, consult a healthcare professional, like your primary care doctor, a dietitian, or a pharmacist, before adding collagen to your treatment regimen, especially if you have any underlying health conditions.
