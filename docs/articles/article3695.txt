Title: How Much CoQ10 Should You Take per Day?

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is made naturally in the body and is also available as a supplement. The dosage varies, but recommendations indicate that you take 100 to 200 milligrams (mg) per day.
CoQ10 has many roles, including energy production and protecting the body from oxidative cell damage.
Many people get enough in their diet. However, if you have a health condition or are taking certain medications, you may want to supplement. For example, if you’re taking statins, supplementing with CoQ10 can help ease muscle pain.
Read on to learn more about recommended CoQ10 dosages and how to take it safely.

What Is CoQ10?
Coenzyme Q10, or  CoQ10 , is a fat-soluble antioxidant present in all human cells.
It’s highly concentrated in the mitochondria, which are specialized structures that produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main source of energy used by your cells.
CoQ10 plays a fundamental role in energy production and acts as a powerful antioxidant, inhibiting the generation of free radicals and preventing cell damage.
Your body produces CoQ10 naturally, but you can also get it  through foods , including eggs,  fatty fish , organ meats, nuts, and poultry.
Even though your body makes CoQ10, several factors can deplete its levels. For example, you produce less as you get older. Your levels can also go down if you take statin medications or have heart disease, nutrient deficiencies, genetic mutations,  oxidative stress , or cancer.
Supplementing with CoQ10 has been shown to counteract damage or improve conditions related to a deficiency in this important compound.
Additionally, as it’s involved in energy production, CoQ10 supplements may help athletes.  Studies  have shown that it can boost athletic performance and decrease inflammation.

Dosage recommendations by health condition
The typical recommended dose is  100 to 300 mg  of CoQ10 per day. However, your needs can vary depending on the medications you take and any health conditions you may have.
Statins are a group of medications that lower high blood levels of cholesterol or  triglycerides  to prevent heart disease. Though they’re generally well tolerated, they can cause side effects like muscle injury and liver damage.
They also interfere with the production of mevalonic acid, a compound that helps form CoQ10. This can significantly  decrease  CoQ10 levels in the blood and muscle tissues.
While current research is conflicting, taking CoQ10 may be a good idea for people who are taking  statins . The recommended dosage is  100 to 200 mg .
People with heart conditions like heart failure and angina may also benefit from taking a CoQ10 supplement.
CoQ10 could help reduce pain associated with angina, which is chest pain due to your heart muscle not getting enough oxygen. What’s more, the supplement may reduce heart disease risk factors, such as  lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL)  or “bad” cholesterol.
While research is relatively limited, studies have shown that CoQ10 supplementation has links to lower all-cause mortality.
The recommended dosage is up to  200 mg  per day.
When used alone or in combination with other nutrients, such as  magnesium  and riboflavin, CoQ10 might improve migraine symptoms. It may also ease headaches by reducing oxidative stress and free radical production, which may otherwise trigger a migraine episode.
A small 2019 study in 45 women demonstrated that those treated with  400 mg  of CoQ10 per day had significant reductions in the frequency, severity, and duration of migraine episodes compared to a placebo group.
As mentioned above, CoQ10 levels naturally  deplete with age . Supplements can raise your levels of CoQ10 and may even improve your overall quality of life.
Older adults with higher blood levels of CoQ10 tend to be more physically active and have lower levels of oxidative stress, which may help prevent heart disease and cognitive decline.
A  2021 article  indicates that CoQ10 supplements improve muscle strength, vitality, and physical performance in older adults.
To counteract the age-related depletion of CoQ10, it’s recommended to take  100 to 200 mg  per day.
Diabetes and its complications have links to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. What’s more, those with  diabetes  may have lower levels of CoQ10, and certain anti-diabetic drugs may further deplete body stores.
CoQ10 also helps improve  insulin resistance  and regulate blood sugar levels in people with diabetes.
A  12-week study  in 50 people with diabetes found that those who received 100 mg of CoQ10 per day had significantly reduced blood sugar, markers of oxidative stress, and insulin resistance compared to the control group.
The recommended dose for people with diabetes is  100 to 200 mg .
Oxidative damage is one of the leading causes of  male and female infertility  because it adversely affects sperm and egg quality. For example, oxidative stress can damage sperm DNA, potentially resulting in  male infertility .
Research has found that dietary antioxidants — including CoQ10 — may help reduce oxidative stress and improve fertility in both men and women.
A 2020 systematic review of studies found that CoQ10 supplementation increased pregnancy rates in those undergoing assistive reproductive technology (ART).
While the review identified doses ranging from  180 mg to 1,200 mg  per day, the participants in the studies only took these amounts for short periods. There are currently no accepted dosage recommendations for infertility.
CoQ10 is involved in energy production, so it’s a popular supplement for athletes looking to boost physical performance. CoQ10 supplements help reduce the inflammation associated with heavy exercise and may even speed up recovery.
One 2023 study indicates that taking CoQ10 before exercise improved athletic performance and lowered oxidative damage. The recommended dosage is  30 mg to 300 mg .

Side effects
Most people tolerate CoQ10, even at high doses. However, some people who are sensitive to the compound may experience side effects, such as diarrhea,  headache , nausea, and skin rashes.
It’s important to note that taking CoQ10 close to bedtime  may cause  insomnia in some people, so it’s best to take it in the morning or afternoon.
CoQ10 supplements can interact with some common medications like  blood thinners , antidepressants, and  chemotherapy drugs . Therefore, it’s important to speak with your doctor before taking supplemental CoQ10.
Because it’s fat-soluble, those supplementing with CoQ10 should keep in mind that the body absorbs it better when you take it with a meal or snack containing a fat source. Additionally, be sure to buy supplements that deliver CoQ10 in the form of ubiquinol, which is the most absorbable.

The bottom line
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) has links to improved aging, exercise performance, heart health, diabetes, fertility, and migraine. It may also counteract the adverse effects of statin medications.
Typically, dosages of around 100 mg to 200 mg of CoQ10 per day are recommended, though some conditions may require higher amounts.
CoQ10 is a relatively well-tolerated and safe supplement that may benefit a wide variety of people looking for a natural way to boost health.
