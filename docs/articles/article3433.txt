Title: How to Gain Weight Fast: Tips to Be Safe and Healthy

Making dietary changes may help you gain weight healthily, such as increasing your intake of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. You can also try consuming nuts, dried fruit, and shakes.
There are many reasons someone may want to gain weight, such as being naturally underweight due to genetics or a fast metabolism. Being underweight may also indicate poor nutrition or underlying health conditions.
Additionally, many people who are not clinically underweight may still want to gain muscle and put on weight for other reasons.
However, gaining weight safely is important. This can include eating more nutrient-dense foods and living an overall healthy lifestyle, such as getting enough sleep and reducing stress where possible.
Whatever your reasons are for wanting to gain weight, there are a variety of strategies you can use.
Below, we’ve outlined several ways that may help.

Increase your caloric intake
The most important thing you can do to gain weight is to create a calorie surplus, meaning you eat more calories than your body needs.
You can determine your calorie needs using this  calorie calculator .
If you want to gain weight slowly and steadily, try aiming for 300–500 calories more than you burn each day according to the calculator. If you want to gain weight fast, try aiming for around 700–1,000 calories above your maintenance level.
Keep in mind that calorie calculators only provide estimates. Your needs may vary by several hundred calories per day, give or take.
You don’t need to count calories forever, but it can help to do it for the first few days or weeks to get a feel for how many calories you’re eating. There are  many great tools  out there to help you.

Eat more protein
Eating enough high quality proteins  is essential  for optimal growth, development, and general health.
A 2020 study of  23 individuals  demonstrated that increasing protein can help increase lean muscle mass.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends adults eat  50 grams (g)  of protein daily. However, this can vary for each individual and depends on factors such as age, sex, and medical history.
High protein foods  include:
meats
fish
eggs
dairy products
legumes
nuts
Protein supplements like  whey protein  can also be helpful if you find it difficult to get enough protein in your diet.
However, protein may also significantly  reduce hunger and appetite , making it harder to get enough calories.
Consider speaking with a doctor to see if increasing your protein intake would help you achieve your goal of gaining weight safely.

Increase your intake of carbs
Carbohydrates (carbs) alone will not lead to an increase in weight, but they  can provide  a great way to consume more calories.
Examples of foods high in healthy carbs  include :
oats
quinoa
fruits, like oranges, bananas, and blueberries
sweet potato
buckwheat
Carbs are a vital part of a balanced diet. The amount you should aim to eat each day can depend on several factors, such as your age, sex, and overall health. However, in general, experts recommend that  45% to 65%  of your daily calories should come from carbs.

Eat more energy-dense foods
It is important to ensure you include a lot of energy-dense foods in your diet. These are foods that contain many calories relative to their weight.
Using plenty of  spices , sauces, and condiments can help with this. The tastier your food is, the easier it may be to eat more. Toppings may also add additional calories.
Here are some energy-dense foods that may help you gain weight:
nuts, like  almonds ,  walnuts , macadamia nuts, and peanuts
dried fruit, like raisins, dates, prunes, and others
high fat dairy, like whole milk, full-fat  yogurt , cheese, and cream
fats and oils, like extra virgin olive oil and  avocado oil
grains, like oats and brown rice
meat, like chicken, beef, pork, and lamb; you can also choose fattier cuts
tubers, like potatoes, sweet potatoes, and yams
other energy-dense foods, like  dark chocolate ,  avocados , peanut butter, coconut milk, granola, and trail mix
If weight gain is a priority for you, it may be a good idea to avoid over-consuming vegetables and fruit. The fiber in fruits and vegetables can help you  feel full  faster, leaving less room for energy-dense foods.

Other quick tips
Here are several other strategies that may help you gain weight even faster:
Avoid drinking water before meals:  This can fill your stomach and  make it harder  to get enough calories.
Try weight gainer shakes:  If you are having trouble gaining weight, consider  weight gainer  shakes. These are very high in protein, carbs, and calories.
Use bigger plates:  Consider  using large plates  if you’re trying to get in more calories, as smaller plates can cause people to eat less.
Take creatine:  The muscle-building supplement  creatine monohydrate  can  help you gain  muscle weight.
Get quality sleep:  Good  sleep hygiene  is  very important  for muscle growth.
Avoid smoking, and if you smoke, consider quitting:  Smokers  tend to weigh less  than non-smokers, and quitting smoking often leads to weight gain.
A  healthy approach  to gaining weight involves gaining a balanced amount of  muscle mass  and subcutaneous fat rather than a lot of unhealthy belly fat.
A high percentage of body fat also  increases your chances  of developing type 2 diabetes and other health problems, even if you have overweight.
Focusing on eating a balanced and healthy diet can still help you gain weight, but in a safe way.

How can I gain weight without eating too much?
To gain weight, you’ll likely need to consume additional calories.
You can avoid overeating and ensure that excess calories go to your muscles instead of just your fat cells by starting a resistance training program.
Resistance training, or  strength training , includes bodyweight exercises and free weights. Resistance training leads to muscle hypertrophy, which  increases muscle mass .
Combining protein supplementation with resistance training can also promote additional gains in lean body mass beyond those gained by resistance exercise alone.
One study found that protein supplementation during  6 weeks  of resistance training increased lean mass growth by 27% in healthy adults.
If you’re new to training, consider hiring a qualified personal trainer or taking a class to help you get started, if this is possible for you.
Consider speaking with a doctor if you have any skeletal problems or medical issues that may make exercising difficult.
