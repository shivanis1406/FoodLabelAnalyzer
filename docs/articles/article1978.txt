There are eight B vitamins that support metabolism, nerve function, and energy production, among other bodily processes. As these vitamins are abundant in food sources like animal products, legumes, leafy greens, and fortified foods, many people get all the B vitamins they need from their diet.
But if you eat vegetarian or vegan, have increased nutrient needs, or have a medical condition that affects your body’s ability to absorb nutrients, you may benefit from taking a B-complex supplement. Here are the products our dietitians recommend most.

Vitamin B complex supplements compared
Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the brands on this page, we considered all the vitamin brands that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further.

How to pick a vitamin B complex supplement
Your needs:  Do you need a supplement that contains all eight B vitamins? Or would you prefer a supplement that contains select B vitamins, such as B12 and folate?
Type of folate:  Many vitamin B complexes contain  folic acid , the synthetic form of folate found in food. However,  research suggests  that folic acid isn’t as readily absorbed as the active form of folate, 5-MTHF. When possible, look for products that contain 5-MTHF.
Dosage:  B vitamins are  water soluble , and your body excretes whatever it doesn’t need via urine — but B vitamin toxicity can still happen. Therefore, it’s best to discuss  optimal doses  of B vitamins with a healthcare professional and use supplements as directed.
Cost:  Some products cost less than others, but it doesn’t mean they’re low quality. Plenty of affordable, well-formulated vitamin B complex supplements are available.

Vitamin B Complex vs. Vitamin B12
Simply put, a vitamin B complex will contain all of the essential B vitamins in one capsule, tablet, or gummy. A vitamin B12 supplement will only contain vitamin B12.
