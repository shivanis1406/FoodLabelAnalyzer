Title: 14 Keto-Friendly Recipes for Your Instant Pot

The ketogenic diet is a low carb, high fat diet that many people use for weight loss.
The diet restricts high carb foods like grains, bread, starchy vegetables, fruits, and desserts, allowing your body to burn fat for fuel instead. If you follow this eating pattern, aim to limit your carb intake to 20–50 grams per day and get around 60% of your daily calories from fat ( 1 ).
To achieve this, it’s helpful to have some tasty and easy keto-friendly recipes on hand. Using an Instant Pot, which is a combined pressure cooker and slow cooker, is an easy and quick way to make keto dishes.
Here are 14 keto recipes you can make in an Instant Pot.

Breakfast
Considering you can throw together eggs, meat, and cheese in no time, it’s incredibly easy to make a keto breakfast in the Instant Pot.
This  breakfast casserole with sausage  is ready in 35 minutes and requires only 4 ingredients. It makes 6 servings and contains less than 1 gram of carbs per serving.
Plus, eggs are an excellent food to enjoy at breakfast. They’re loaded with filling protein and provide several nutrients, including choline, which is vital for brain and nervous system health ( 2 ).
If you’re not a morning person or need to eat breakfast on the go, make these  low carb egg bites  in your Instant Pot. They’re freezer-friendly and easy to reheat.
Made with eggs, cream, cheese, and bacon, each bite provides only 1 gram of carbs and 11 grams of protein.
You can modify the recipe to include non-starchy vegetables like broccoli or bell peppers. This adds a good dose of vitamin C and fiber, which can aid digestive health ( 3 ).

Lunch
Buffalo sauce and chicken is a winning culinary combo, and lettuce wraps are a great way to enjoy this duo on the keto diet.
With the help of the Instant Pot, you can have perfectly cooked buffalo chicken in under 30 minutes. Pile it on top of crunchy romaine leaves, and your low carb lunch is ready to serve.
These  cheesy buffalo chicken lettuce wraps  use a few different sources of dairy, all of which provide bone-building calcium ( 4 ).
The recipe makes four servings, each of which has 2 grams of net carbs.  Net carbs  are calculated by subtracting the grams of fiber from the total carb count. They’re typically used to add up daily carbs on a keto diet.
Enjoy all of the best flavors of tacos in soup form — without the high carb tortillas.
Low carb taco soup  is made with ground beef, cream cheese, and cream, making it a filling, keto-friendly lunch option. It even has some veggies in the form of diced tomatoes and chili peppers.
Making taco soup in the Instant Pot reduces the cooking time and yields enough for the entire family. Each serving has 7 grams of net carbs.
What’s more, beef has an abundance of nutrients, including vitamin B12, which supports a healthy nervous system ( 5 ).
If you love take-out egg rolls, try making deconstructed egg rolls in a bowl in the Instant Pot. They boast similar flavors but aren’t deep fried. Plus, they can fit into a keto diet.
These  low carb Instant Pot egg roll bowls  can be made in advance for easy lunches throughout the week, with each bowl containing only 8 grams of net carbs.
This recipe is also loaded with veggies, including cabbage, carrots, mushrooms, and green onions, all of which provide fiber. Eating more fiber can help reduce constipation, a common side effect of the keto diet ( 1 ).
Savor the flavors of shrimp scampi in this low carb rendition, which is served over cauliflower rice instead of pasta.
The  recipe  comes from the Instant Pot website and boasts a short prep time. With ingredients like white wine,  garlic , and lemon juice, it’s flavorful and keto-friendly. Each serving has 7 grams of net carbs.
Shrimp is a nutritious lean protein that’s great to use in keto meals. It contains healthy fats and is a good source of selenium, an essential mineral that protects your body from oxidative damage that can otherwise contribute to disease ( 6 ).

Dinner
Fish is a healthy protein source to enjoy on the keto diet, and the Instant Pot can cook most types of fish in minutes.
With only 10 minutes of cooking time, this  keto-friendly salmon and asparagus recipe  is sure to be a winning meal on busy nights. It yields 4 servings, each with 5 grams of total carbs and 3 grams of net carbs.
Eating more salmon has health benefits, too. Salmon is rich in protein, vitamins, minerals, and omega 3 fatty acids that may help prevent heart disease ( 7 ).
Creamy chicken and mushrooms is a comforting and satisfying meal, and it can be on the table in just 30 minutes with the help of the Instant Pot.
The ingredients in this  Instant Pot chicken and mushrooms  meal are basic yet delicious — and low in carbs. The recipe makes 6 servings, which is ideal for feeding the whole family, and each serving has under 3 grams of carbs.
Plus, mushrooms provide important nutrients, including B vitamins that assist with energy metabolism in your body. They also contain several beneficial compounds that may protect against cancer and other diseases ( 8 ).
Pot roast is typically a time-intensive dish, but with the Instant Pot, you can prepare a keto-friendly roast in about an hour.
This  keto pot roast  features tender beef chuck, which is high in fat and protein, paired with a variety of non-starchy veggies. The recipe yields 8 servings, each of which has only 3 grams of net carbs.
The veggies — zucchini, cauliflower, onions, celery, and peppers — provide fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Radishes, which contain compounds that may have antidiabetic effects, take the place of potatoes ( 9 ).
The Instant Pot makes it incredibly easy to cook perfect pork chops in no time.
That’s one reason why these  sour cream pork chops  are a great option for a quick dinner on busy nights. Sour cream contributes additional fat and a tangy, creamy flavor, helping keep the net carbs at 5 grams per serving.
Besides being an excellent source of protein, pork provides a variety of micronutrients. It’s one of the best dietary sources of thiamine, a water-soluble  B vitamin  necessary for extracting energy from food ( 10 ).

Snacks and desserts
While snack foods are often associated with carbs, you can still enjoy delicious snacks on a keto diet.
These  Instant Pot blueberry muffins  use coconut flour and erythritol, a sugar alcohol that’s subtracted from the total fiber content, to keep the carb content low. Each muffin has only 2 grams of net carbs, making them a perfect keto treat to enjoy between meals.
Blueberries are one of the few keto-friendly fruits, provided you eat them in small portions. What’s more, eating blueberries is linked to a reduced risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes ( 11 ).
Spinach artichoke dip is typically made with high fat ingredients, and with a few tweaks, it can fit into a keto eating plan.
Artichokes contain an abundance of health-promoting compounds known as polyphenols, which may help protect against heart disease ( 12 ,  13 ).
Instant Pot spinach artichoke dip  takes only 25 minutes to prepare and yields 10 servings, each of which has 6 grams of net carbs. Serve this dip with low carb veggies, such as cauliflower florets.
On the keto diet, you can still have your cake and eat it too.
Instant Pot cheesecake , made with high fat, keto-friendly ingredients, is a decadent sweet treat. It’s hard to believe that each slice has only 8 grams of net carbs.
While this recipe is to be enjoyed in moderation, it still has some nutritional value. The dairy products contribute calcium, potassium, and vitamin A.

These  keto English muffins  are made with cream cheese, butter, eggs, coconut flour, Parmesan cheese, and seasonings. Each muffin has about 4 grams of net carbs.
To make a nutritious meal or snack, top a muffin with smashed avocado and hard-boiled eggs. The avocado will provide heart-healthy fats and fiber, while the eggs contribute satisfying protein.
