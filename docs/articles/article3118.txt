BOTTOM LINE: The Ornish diet is a low fat, lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet that focuses on switching up your eating pattern. Though it may help support weight loss, it’s very low in fat and limits intake of specific food groups, which may cause some nutrient deficiencies.

What is the Ornish Diet?
The Ornish Diet is a plan developed by Dr. Dean Ornish, a physician, researcher, and founder of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito, California.
The plan is essentially a low-fat,  lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet  that focuses on plant-based ingredients like fruits, veggies, whole grains, and legumes.
Other foods are also permitted on the plan, including soy products, egg whites, and limited amounts of non-fat dairy.
According to the diet’s creator, simply switching up your eating pattern can promote weight loss and reverse the progression of chronic conditions like prostate cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.
It’s said to work by activating health-promoting genes while  reversing aging  at a cellular level.

How to follow the Ornish Diet
Unlike many other  fad diets , the Ornish Diet is straightforward and easy to follow.
There is no need to count calories or track your nutrient intake, and no foods are completely off-limits as part of the diet, aside from most animal products.
However, meat, fish, and poultry are not included in the diet, and high-fat foods like nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils are permitted only in limited amounts.
Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and soy foods are key components of the Ornish Diet and should comprise the majority of your meals.
Egg whites are also permitted, and up to two daily servings of non-fat dairy products like milk and  yogurt  can be enjoyed as well.
Healthy fats  should make up about 10% of your total daily calorie intake and mostly come from naturally occurring fats in whole foods like whole grains and legumes.
Three or fewer servings of foods like nuts and seeds can also be eaten per day. However, it’s important to keep in mind that the serving sizes are very small, and one serving should contain fewer than 3 grams of fat.
Also, caffeinated beverages, refined carbs, sugar, alcohol, and low-fat packaged foods should be limited as part of the diet.
In addition to making changes to your diet, it’s also recommended to get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily to optimize results.
The Ornish Diet involves eating mostly low-fat, plant-based foods and limiting animal products, refined carbs, high-fat foods, and processed ingredients.

Benefits
The Ornish Diet may be associated with several health benefits.
The Ornish Diet emphasizes  nutrient-dense ingredients  like fruits, veggies, and plant-based proteins, making it an excellent option if you’re looking to lose weight.
According to one study in 20 people, following the Ornish Diet for 1 year resulted in an average weight loss of 7.5 pounds (3.3 kg), which was greater than other popular diets like Atkins, Weight Watchers, and the Zone Diet ( 1 ).
Similarly, another 1-year study found that 76 participants who followed the Ornish Diet lost an average of 5 pounds (2.2 kg) ( 2 ).
Furthermore, other studies show that switching to a vegetarian diet could  aid weight loss .
In one study in 74 people with type 2 diabetes, following a vegetarian diet for 6 months was significantly more effective than a low-calorie diet at promoting fat loss ( 3 ).
Promising research suggests that the Ornish Diet could help prevent chronic disease.
In fact, studies show that vegetarian diets may be associated with a lower risk of heart disease, diabetes, and obesity ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ).
Other studies have found that  vegetarian and vegan diets  may be linked to a lower risk of certain types of cancer, including stomach, colorectal, prostate, and breast cancer ( 7 ,  8 ,  9   10 ).
What’s more, one small study in 18 people compared the effects of three popular diets, including the Ornish Diet, over 4 weeks.
The Ornish Diet reduced levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL (bad) cholesterol, and inflammation, all of which are risk factors for heart disease ( 11 ).
Unlike other diet plans that require you to carefully  count calories  or track your nutrient intake, the Ornish Diet requires minimal effort and is relatively easy to follow.
According to the diet’s creator, aside from certain animal products, no foods are completely off-limits on the plan — though some ingredients should be limited.
Even certain prepackaged convenience items like veggie burgers or whole-grain cereals are permitted in moderation, provided they contain fewer than 3 grams of fat per serving.
Given that the diet is not overloaded with complicated rules and regulations, it’s easy to stick to in the long run.
The Ornish Diet may increase weight loss and aid disease prevention. It’s also more flexible and easier to follow than other diet plans.

Potential downsides
Though the Ornish Diet is associated with several potential benefits, there are some downsides to consider.
For starters, it’s  very low in healthy fats , with less than 10% of total daily calories coming from fat.
Most health experts and regulatory agencies recommend getting around 20–35% of your total daily calories from fat to help optimize health ( 12 ).
Healthy fats like mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids can protect against heart disease, reduce inflammation, support brain function, and ensure healthy growth and development ( 12 ,  13 ,  14 ).
Additionally, it’s important to keep in mind that removing meat and certain animal products from your diet can increase your  risk of nutritional deficiencies .
In fact, studies show that vegetarian diets tend to be lower in important nutrients like protein, calcium, vitamin B12, and zinc ( 15 ).
Monitoring your intake of these key vitamins and minerals and enjoying a variety of nutrient-dense fruits, veggies, whole grains, and legumes can ensure that you’re able to meet your needs while following the Ornish Diet.
You may also opt to take a  multivitamin , which can help fill any gaps in your diet to prevent a nutritional deficiency.
The Ornish Diet is very low in healthy fats and requires careful planning to prevent nutritional deficiencies.
