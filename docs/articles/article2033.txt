Proper hydration is extremely important for your health. But drinking water is not the only way to stay hydrated. Foods that contain a lot of water include many fruit and vegetables, some dairy, as well as broths and soups.
In fact, not drinking enough water can lead to  dehydration , which can cause fatigue, headaches, skin problems, muscle cramps, low blood pressure and a rapid heart rate ( 1 ).
Moreover, prolonged dehydration can lead to serious complications like organ failure ( 1 ).
Experts generally recommend drinking several glasses of water per day to  meet your hydration needs .
But while drinking water is very important, you can also get it from foods. There are many healthy foods that can contribute a large amount of water to your diet.
This article discussed 19 water-rich foods that will help you stay hydrated.

Because of their high water content, watermelons have a very low  calorie density . That means that a relatively large portion of watermelon contains very few calories.
Foods with low calorie densities have been shown to help with weight loss by promoting fullness and reducing appetite ( 3 ,  4 ).
