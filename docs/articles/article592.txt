Title: 9 Nutritious Keto-Friendly Fruits

Many high carb foods are considered off-limits on the keto diet, including certain types of grains, starchy vegetables, legumes, and fruits. However, you can eat some fruits that are low in carbs and high in fiber.
The ketogenic, or keto, diet is a very low carb, high fat eating plan on which carb intake is often restricted to less than 20–50 grams per day.
Some fruit is also high in fiber, an indigestible type of carb that doesn’t count toward your total daily carb count. That means they contain fewer net, or digestible, carbs. This is calculated by subtracting the grams of fiber from the total grams of carbs.
Here are 9 nutritious, tasty, and keto-friendly fruits.
