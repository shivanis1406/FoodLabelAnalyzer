Rhodiola ( Rhodiola rosea ) is an herb that grows in regions of Russia and Asia.
It has long been known as an adaptogen — a natural, nontoxic herb that stimulates your body’s stress response system to increase stress resistance ( 1 ).
The adaptogenic properties of  rhodiola  are linked to two of the herb’s potent active components: rosavin and salidroside ( 2 ).
A small 8-week study involving 100 people with chronic fatigue symptoms, such as poor sleep quality and impairments in short-term memory and concentration, found that supplementing with 400 mg of rhodiola extract per day improved symptoms after just 1 week ( 3 ).
Participants’ symptoms continued to decrease throughout the study.
Likewise, in one small high quality study in 80 people with mild anxiety, researchers found that those who took 400 mg of rhodiola per day experienced significant improvements in stress and anxiety after 2 weeks compared with those who received no treatment ( 4 ).
If you’re interested in trying rhodiola,  HUM Nutrition  Big Chill is one of the best options.
The supplement contains a clinically researched effective dose of 500 mg of  R. rosea  extract per serving. It’s also third-party tested and free of artificial sweeteners and colors.

Melatonin  is a natural hormone that regulates your body’s circadian rhythm, or sleep-wake cycle.
Levels of the hormone increase in the evening when it’s dark to promote sleep and decrease in the morning when it’s light to promote wakefulness ( 5 ).
Some research suggests that because stress is linked to insomnia, supplementing with melatonin may help ( 6 ,  7 ).
One review of 7 high quality studies involving 205 people investigated the effectiveness of melatonin for managing secondary  sleep disorders , which are those that result from another condition, such as stress or depression.
The researchers concluded that melatonin decreased the time it took people to fall asleep and increased total sleep time but did not significantly affect sleep quality as compared to a placebo ( 8 ).
Randomized controlled trials have found doses as small as 0.5 mg per night to be effective ( 9 ).
Though melatonin is a natural hormone, supplementing with it does not affect your body’s production of it. Melatonin is also non-habit-forming, but it’s best to start with the lowest dose possible and work up to a higher dose if necessary ( 10 ,  11 ).
If you find that you’re having trouble sleeping as a result of stress and you’re interested in trying a melatonin supplement, Life Extension IR/XR Magnesium is a great option.
The supplement contains a total of 1.5 mg of immediate-release and extended-release melatonin, which may help you fall asleep and stay asleep through the night.
Life Extension is a trusted company that manufactures its supplements according to standards that exceed those established by the FDA. The company’s raw materials are also third-party tested.
However, while some Life Extension supplements are third-party tested, its Melatonin IR/XR is not.

Magnesium  is an essential mineral that your body uses in more than 300 different biochemical reactions.
It’s involved in numerous aspects of healthy bodily function, including DNA synthesis, nerve and muscle function, and blood sugar and blood pressure regulation ( 12 ).
Magnesium is found mostly in nuts and seeds, green leafy vegetables, and fish.
Research shows that magnesium may be involved in stress management, particularly for people who don’t get enough magnesium in their diet.
One older study in 100 people found that people who supplemented with 400 mg of magnesium per day for 90 days had increased heart rate variability (HRV) compared to a control group ( 13 ).
Some studies have linked low HRV to depression, sleep disturbances, and stress ( 14 ,  15 ).
Another high quality trial assessed the effects of daily supplementation of 300 mg of magnesium and 30 mg of vitamin B6 for 8 weeks in 264 people with low magnesium levels ( 16 ).
Researchers in this study noted that participants who received magnesium alone had similar decreases in stress scores to those who received magnesium and vitamin B6.
However, people with stress that was categorized as “severe” or “extremely severe” saw more improvement when taking both magnesium and vitamin B6 ( 16 ).
Innate Vitality Magnesium Glycinate is a great  magnesium supplement  because it contains 500 mg of magnesium glycinate, a form of magnesium that may be easier for the body to absorb than other commonly used supplemental magnesium forms, such as magnesium citrate ( 17 ).
The supplement is also third-party tested and free of artificial additives.

Ashwagandha ( Withania somnifera)  is an adaptogenic herb native to India, where it has been used in Indian Ayurveda, one of the world’s oldest medicinal systems ( 18 ).
Similarly to rhodiola,  ashwagandha  is thought to enhance your body’s resilience to physical and mental stress.
In one study on the stress-relieving effects of ashwagandha, researchers randomized 60 individuals with mild stress to receive 240 mg of a standardized ashwagandha extract or a placebo daily for 60 days ( 19 ).
Compared with the placebo, supplementing with ashwagandha was strongly associated with greater reductions in stress, anxiety, and depression. Ashwagandha was also linked to a 23% reduction in morning levels of cortisol, a stress hormone ( 19 ).
What’s more, an older review of five studies examining the effects of ashwagandha on anxiety and stress observed that people who supplemented with ashwagandha extract scored better on tests measuring levels of stress, anxiety, and  fatigue  ( 20 ).
Klaire Labs Ashwagandha Extract provides 300 mg of ashwagandha extract per 1-capsule serving, and it’s free from artificial additives and major allergens.
Klaire Labs prides itself on producing high quality, research-backed supplements. Its products are manufactured in CGMP-compliant facilities, though the products are not third-party tested.

L-theanine is an amino acid most commonly found in tea leaves.
Researchers have studied it for its ability to promote relaxation and reduce stress without having sedative effects ( 21 ,  22 ).
One high quality study in 30 people found that taking 200 mg of L-theanine per day significantly improved depression symptoms, sleep quality, cognitive function, and stress compared to a placebo ( 23 ).
In another study in 34 people, drinking a beverage containing 200 mg of  L-theanine  and other nutrients lowered levels of cortisol in response to a stressful task that involved multitasking ( 24 ).
L-theanine is well tolerated and safe when used as a supplement for relaxation at its effective dose, which is 200–600 mg per day in capsule form ( 25 ,  26 ).
Pure Encapsulations L-Theanine contains 400 mg of L-theanine per 2-capsule serving. It’s vegan-friendly and certified gluten-free.
Pure Encapsulations works with several third-party labs to ensure quality control, including Silliker, Intertek, Eurofins, and Advanced Laboratories.
If you dislike taking supplements, it’s worth noting that green tea is also a great source of L-theanine.
One small randomized controlled trial noted that drinking at least 300 mL (about 1.5 cups) of low caffeine  green tea  reduced stress markers significantly more than regular green tea ( 27 ).
Because caffeine may inhibit L-theanine’s effectiveness, low caffeine green tea appears to be more effective ( 27 ).

B-complex vitamin supplements  usually contain all eight B vitamins.
These vitamins play an important role in metabolism by transforming the food you eat into usable energy. B vitamins are also essential for heart and brain health ( 28 ).
Food sources of B vitamins include grains, meats, legumes, eggs, dairy products, and leafy greens.
Interestingly, some research suggests that high doses of B vitamins may improve symptoms of stress, such as mood and energy levels, by lowering blood levels of the amino acid homocysteine ( 28 ,  29 ).
High homocysteine levels  are associated with stress and an increased risk of several health conditions, including heart disease, dementia, and colorectal cancer ( 30 ,  31 ,  32 ).
What’s more, a review of 12 high quality trials noted that daily B vitamin supplementation for at least 4 weeks may help significantly decrease stress and improve mood ( 33 ).
Another older study observed similar results, suggesting that supplementing with B vitamins as part of a multivitamin and mineral supplement may improve mood and stress by lowering homocysteine levels ( 34 ).
However, it’s unclear whether people who already have low homocysteine levels will experience these effects.
While there are several great B-complex supplements, MegaFood Balanced B Complex is a great option.
Each serving contains at least 100% of the Daily Value for all eight B vitamins in forms that are easy for the body to absorb, such as folate in the form of 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate instead of folic acid ( 35 ).
Plus, the supplement is easy to digest and can be taken on an empty stomach.

Vitamin D is sometimes called the “sunshine vitamin” because your body can make it after sun exposure. It’s not naturally found in large amounts in many foods, and many people don’t get enough in their diet ( 36 ).
One of vitamin D’s main functions is to help your body absorb more calcium, but researchers have found that it’s also  involved in several other processes , such as reducing inflammation and promoting immune function ( 36 ).
It may also help with stress reduction, especially in people who have a vitamin D deficiency.
In one small high quality study in 86 people who did not have vitamin D deficiency, researchers found that those who consumed 1,600 IU of vitamin D daily for about 4 months throughout winter didn’t experience the dip in vitamin D levels that typically occurs as a result of getting less sun exposure during these months ( 37 ).
They also found that those in the control group, who received a placebo, had a longer period of stress following a stressful situation than those in the vitamin D group ( 37 ).
Other high quality studies in women noted that taking 50,000 IU of vitamin D every 2 weeks, when paired with either probiotics or omega-3 supplements, helped improve depression, anxiety, and stress (probiotics) and anxiety and sleep (omega-3s) ( 38 ,  39 ).
Just keep in mind that it’s best to get your vitamin D levels checked by a healthcare professional before taking vitamin D supplements. As interest in vitamin D supplementation has grown, vitamin D toxicity has become much more common ( 40 ).
Nordic Naturals Vitamin D3 1000 is one of the  best vitamin D supplements  because it contains 1,000 IU of vitamin D3 — the active form of vitamin D, also known as calcitriol.
Nordic Naturals supplements are third-party tested, and you can easily view the testing results by searching for the certificate of analysis (COA) for each product on the company’s website.

How to choose supplements for stress
Here are some factors to keep in mind when shopping for supplements to help with stress:
Intended effect:  Is stress affecting your sleep or your ability to focus? Look for a product formulated to address your specific issues. For example, melatonin may help  improve sleep , whereas rhodiola and L-theanine are better options for focus and productivity.
Price:  Price is an important consideration. Especially if you’ll be taking supplements for an extended period, it’s important to know how much you’ll be spending each month.
Quality:  Because the FDA doesn’t regulate supplements in the same way as medications, it’s important to select products from trusted brands. Ideally, look for products that are third-party tested to ensure purity and potency.
Professional help:  It’s a good idea to consult a healthcare professional before taking supplements. They can help you choose products and can order blood work or analyze your diet to see if you’re deficient in any essential nutrients that may affect stress levels.
Drug interactions:  Because some supplement ingredients can interact with medications, it’s important to check with a healthcare professional before taking any new supplements if you’re already taking prescription or over-the-counter medications.

Frequently asked questions
B vitamins and vitamin D may help with stress. However, these may be helpful only for people who have low levels of these vitamins and cannot meet their needs through diet alone ( 33 ,  41 ,  42 ).
You may have inadequate levels of B vitamins, vitamin D, or magnesium if you are feeling stressed. However, this is not the case for everyone.
The best way to know for sure is to ask a healthcare professional for a blood test or purchase a home  micronutrient testing kit  to check your blood levels of these nutrients.
Kava  is a supplement made from the roots of the  Piper methysticum  plant. It has a long history of use for relieving stress and anxiety in traditional herbal medicine, and research suggests that it does offer some stress-relieving benefits ( 43 ).
However, researchers have also noted rare cases of liver damage arising from kava use.
Not enough information is available about these episodes to allow researchers to confidently create dosing or safety guidelines. For this reason, we recommend avoiding kava and choosing alternatives that have a better safety profile ( 43 ).

The bottom line
Several vitamins and other supplements, including  Rhodiola rosea , melatonin, vitamin D, and ashwagandha, have been linked to  reduced stress  symptoms.
L-theanine, B-complex vitamins, and magnesium may also help increase your body’s resistance to life’s stressors.
Always consult a healthcare professional before trying a new supplement, especially if you’re taking other medications or if you’re pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
If stress continues to be a problem in your life, consider speaking with a medical professional or therapist about possible solutions.
