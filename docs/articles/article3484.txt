What Is Caffeine?
Caffeine  is a naturally-occurring chemical that acts as a central nervous system stimulant, enhancing alertness and fighting off fatigue.
It can be found in the leaves, seeds and fruits of many plants and is especially prevalent in  cocoa  beans, tea leaves and coffee beans ( 3 ).
It’s also commonly added to many products, including soft drinks,  energy drinks  and certain over-the-counter medications.
Nowadays, caffeine tops the charts as one of the most commonly consumed ingredients around the world ( 4 ).
In fact, it’s estimated that 85% of the US population consumes at least one caffeinated beverage per day, with an average daily intake of 165 mg of caffeine.
While coffee accounts for the majority of caffeine intake across the board, carbonated soft drinks like Coke make up a high proportion of the intake in those younger than 18 ( 5 ).

Why Caffeine Intake Matters for Some
Caffeine consumption can have several benefits for your health.
In particular, research shows that it may  increase metabolism ,  improve exercise performance  and boost alertness ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ).
However, it can also come with negative  side effects , especially for people who are sensitive to its effects.
Caffeine can be addictive, and some research indicates that genetic variations could cause people to respond differently to it ( 12 ,  13 ).
Caffeine intake has also been shown to affect mental health, with one study in 2,307 children associating increased caffeine consumption with higher levels of perceived anxiety and depression ( 14 ).
Excess intake can also cause other side effects, including headaches, high blood pressure and sleep disturbances ( 15 ,  16 ,  17 ).
Additionally, it’s recommended that women who are pregnant or breastfeeding limit their caffeine intake, as it may be linked to a higher risk of miscarriage and low birth weight ( 18 ,  19 ).
Caffeine consumption has been linked to improvements in metabolism, exercise performance and alertness. However, it can also be addictive and may cause a wide range of side effects in some people.

How Much Caffeine Is Too Much?
When consumed in moderation, caffeine can be used safely with minimal risk of side effects.
In fact, doses up to 400 mg daily are considered safe for most adults ( 20 ).
Ideally, though, it’s best to limit your intake to around 200 mg daily to reduce your risk of side effects.
For reference, this equals just two 8-ounce (237-ml)  cups of coffee  or around five 8-ounce (237-ml) cups of green tea.
However, you would need to drink more than six 12-ounce (355-ml) cans of Coke or four 12-ounce (355-ml) cans of Diet Coke per day to reach this amount.
400 mg of caffeine daily is considered safe for most adults, but cutting your intake to 200 mg daily can help reduce your risk of adverse side effects.

The Bottom Line
Coke and Diet Coke contain 32 and 42 mg of caffeine per 12 ounces (335 ml) respectively, which is lower than other caffeinated beverages like coffee, tea and energy drinks.
However, they’re often high in sugar and other unhealthy ingredients, so keep your intake to a minimum to promote better health.
Instead, opt for other natural sources of caffeine in moderation, such as coffee or tea, to maximize the potential health benefits.
