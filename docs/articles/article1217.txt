Title: Is Hummus Keto-Friendly? Carbs, Substitutes, and More

There’s no easier (or tastier) appetizer than hummus and pita chips.
What’s more, hummus is highly regarded as a nutritious snack, especially compared with other dips and spreads, which tend to be high in fat and calories.
However, you might be curious if you can eat hummus on the low carb, high fat keto diet.
Hummus is usually made from just four ingredients — chickpeas, olive oil, tahini, and lemon juice. Of these four, the only ingredient of concern for keto dieters is the chickpeas.
While most people on keto aim to keep their daily total carb intake below 50 grams (or net carb intake — which is total carbs minus fiber — below 25 grams), 1/2 cup (90 grams) of cooked chickpeas packs 20 grams of total carbs and 13 grams of net carbs ( 1 ).
This article explains whether hummus is keto-friendly and lists a few alternatives.

How many carbs are in hummus?
A 2-tablespoon (30-gram) serving of plain hummus contains ( 2 ):
Calories:  78
Protein:  2 grams
Fat:  5 grams
Total carbs:  6 grams
Fiber:  2 grams
Net carbs:  4 grams
This serving size of hummus is about the size of a golf ball, so it may be a smaller amount than you’d typically serve yourself in one sitting.
Even this small amount packs 4 grams of  net carbs .
Most flavors, such as  roasted garlic  or red pepper, won’t significantly change the carb count or amount of other nutrients.
A 2-tablespoon (30-gram) serving of hummus provides 6 grams of total carbs and 4 grams of net carbs.

Does hummus fit the keto diet?
Hummus can definitely be part of your keto diet, but just one or two servings can quickly expend a significant portion of your daily carb allotment.
If you do eat hummus, you’ll want to limit yourself to a small amount — perhaps just 2–4 tablespoons (30–60 grams), which provide 4–8 grams of net carbs.
Plus, it’s best to carefully plan the other foods that you eat to ensure that your carb count remains low enough to stay in  ketosis , which is the metabolic state of burning fat for fuel rather than carbs ( 3 ).
Also, remember to carefully measure your serving, as it’s easy to overestimate how much 2–4 tablespoons (30–60 grams) really is.
Additionally, you’ll want to avoid dessert hummus, which typically is chocolate-flavored and contains  added sugar  ( 4 ).
If you use hummus as a dip, you’ll want to carefully consider what you dip into your hummus.
Most crackers are too high in carbs for the keto diet, as is pita bread — unless you specifically seek out keto-friendly versions. Even the carbs in  carrots  add up quickly ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
Instead, celery, raw broccoli, and raw  cauliflower  are good dipping options.
If you’re concerned about going overboard with dip, try using hummus as a garnish. Add it to  salad  or soup for a flavorful, creamy twist, or use it as a low calorie swap for mayonnaise when making low carb sandwiches or wraps.
Treating hummus like a garnish rather than a dip makes it easier to manage your portion size.
Hummus works in small amounts on the keto diet, but you may want to use it as a garnish rather than a dip. That’s because its net carbs add up quickly.

Lower carb alternatives to hummus
While a small serving or two of hummus may be fine to have occasionally on the keto diet, you may want an alternative that’s lower in carbs, especially if you’re craving a dip. Here are a few options:
Baba ganoush.  Baba ganoush is a Mediterranean spread and dip made from eggplant rather than chickpeas, although the other ingredients are similar. This  baba ganoush recipe  contains about 3 grams of net carbs per 3-tablespoon (45-gram) serving.
Paté.  Paté is a smooth spread made from cooked chicken, beef, or duck liver. It’s high in fat and typically only contains trace amounts of carbs (though it’s expensive to buy and time-consuming to make). A 2-tablespoon (30-gram) serving of this  chicken liver pate recipe  doesn’t contain any carbs.
Black soybean hummus.  You can also make your own hummus from black soybeans, which are extremely high in fiber, to keep the net carb count on the lower side. This  black soybean hummus  contains 2 grams of net carbs per 3-tablespoon (30-gram) serving.
Spreads and dips like baba ganoush, liver pate, and black soybean hummus are much lower in carbs than hummus and may be a better fit for the keto diet.

The bottom line
While hummus is suitable for the  keto diet , you’ll want to limit yourself to a small amount. Consider using it as a garnish rather than as a dip, and avoid dessert flavors.
You may also want to consider other low carb  dips and spreads , such as baba ganoush, pate, or black soybean hummus.
Finally, remember to choose keto-friendly crackers, pita breads, or veggies for dipping.
