Known for its commitment to transparency and quality, it’s no surprise that  Transparent Labs  protein powders frequently make Healthline’s “best of” lists — including this one.
Not only is Transparent Labs Whey Protein  Informed Choice  and  Informed Protein  certified, but it’s also pretty darn tasty.
Nick Trull, Healthline’s director of business development and fitness aficionado, praised the peanut butter flavor: “I have been using the Transparent Labs Whey Grass Fed Protein for several months. It has been a great additive to post-workout recovery shakes and  breakfast shakes . The product consistency, smell, and taste are all great.
“I would certainly recommend the product to others, and my wife has actually incorporated it into her meals as well!”
If you’re not a peanut butter fan, not to worry. The powder is available in 13 additional flavors, most of which also get rave reviews for taste online.

If you’ve had a hard time finding a vanilla-flavored whey protein powder that’s good enough to drink outside of a smoothie, then you may want to check out this option from  mindbodygreen .
Healthline contributor,  Kelli McGrane , MS, RD, noted that she was surprised by how much she enjoyed this powder: “Vanilla is one of my favorite flavors, but I tend to steer clear of it with protein powders because of how hard is to find an option that isn’t artificial-tasting or overly sweet.
“The first time I tried it, I mixed 1 scoop of mindbodygreen’s vanilla whey protein with 6 ounces (oz) [177 milliliters (mL)] of water and 2 oz (59 mL) of  oat milk , fully expecting to only make it a few sips before putting it back in the fridge to be used in a smoothie later. However, before I knew it, I had finished the whole shake.
“In addition to being easy to mix, I appreciated that the consistency was both smooth and refreshing, I also really liked the addition of cinnamon. I found that it gave the powder a French vanilla-like taste.”
The powder also comes in chocolate, which McGrane also tried but didn’t like quite as much.
Mindbodygreen’s  whey protein isolate  is gluten-free, vegetarian-friendly, and third-party tested for purity and potency, though the name of the testing organization isn’t disclosed.

Made from just three ingredients, including organic coconut sugar and  cacao powder , Naked Chocolate Whey Protein Powder is a great option for people who dislike the aftertaste of sugar substitutes like stevia or monk fruit.
McGrane, who has tried multiple protein powders over the years, confidently states that this is by far her favorite chocolate whey-based option.
According to McGrane: “I’m not a huge fan of  stevia  — the aftertaste just isn’t for me — so I like that Naked Whey uses sugar instead.
“I’ve tried multiple flavors of this powder, but the chocolate is by far my favorite. I love that it has a creamy, rich chocolate taste that isn’t overly sweet. While it’s satisfying mixed with just water and a splash of oat milk, my favorite way to use it is blended in a smoothie with a frozen banana and a handful of spinach.
“The only downside is that, as with most whey-based protein powders, I do notice some bloating and general discomfort if I drink this powder  multiple days  in a row.”
Naked Whey Protein is available in four additional flavors, plus an unflavored variety. It’s also Informed Choice certified, so you can trust that the powder contains what it claims to on the label and nothing more.

Ora Organic So Lean & So Clean Vanilla is our pick as the best vanilla-flavored plant-based powder.
According to McGrane, “I’ve tried a handful of  plant-based protein powders  on the market, and Ora Organics is my favorite vanilla-flavored option because it lacks the cloyingly sweet, artificial vanilla flavor that many other powders have.
“I also appreciate that the powder mixes easily in a shaker bottle and actually feels refreshing to drink. I primarily use the powder in my overnight oats for a boost of protein in the morning, but it’s also delicious blended into a smoothie.”
Despite containing stevia and  monk fruit , McGrane notes that it doesn’t have a noticeable aftertaste.
Ora Organics So Lean & So Clean contains a handful of certified organic plant-based ingredients, including peas, rice, amaranth, and sprouted quinoa, as well as various organic fruits and vegetables.
It’s also third-party tested for purity and potency, though the name of the testing organization isn’t disclosed.

Orgain Simple Organic is our pick for chocolate lovers needing a plant-based option,
According to Healthline Senior Editor  Chelsea Logan:  “I chose this protein powder because I was looking for something vegan without stevia or monk fruit extract, as I don’t like the taste of these sweeteners.
“This one is sweetened with coconut sugar and tastes super sweet to me (almost too sweet), but it does have a nice chocolate flavor and smells and tastes almost like hot chocolate.
“It blends well, too, and doesn’t have any chalkiness to it, even if you just mix it with water.”
Orgain Simple Organic Plant-Based Protein Powder is certified organic and certified plant-based. It’s also third-party tested for purity and potency, though the name of the testing organization isn’t disclosed.
In addition to chocolate, this vegan-friendly option is also available in vanilla and peanut butter.

How to choose the best protein powder
Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the products on this page, we considered all the protein powders that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further.
When picking a protein powder, there are several factors to look for:
Protein source:  The main source of protein is an important consideration, especially if you have any dietary restrictions. While whey is one of the most common protein powder ingredients, you can find products sourced from peas, seeds, or soy, which can be useful if you follow a plant-based or  vegan diet .
Nutritional facts:  In addition to the amount of protein found in each serving, look at the calorie and carb content. This is especially important if you’re trying to lose weight or restricting your carb intake as part of a low carb or  ketogenic diet .
Ingredients list:  In addition to protein sources, many products include ingredients that may offer other health benefits, including greens, probiotics, digestive enzymes, and healthy fats. However, try to avoid protein powders with a long list of additives, such as artificial colors and preservatives.
Available flavors:  Before choosing a flavor, consider how you plan on using the powder. For example, vanilla or plain tend to be more versatile than stronger flavors like chocolate, matcha, or coffee.
Texture:  Perhaps one of the most important considerations is the texture. While some dissolve easily when stirred or shaken, others require a blender.
Budget:  The number of servings per container varies greatly by product. Thus, when looking at the price of a protein powder, be sure to consider the cost per serving.
Customer reviews:  Reading customer reviews is a great way to obtain valuable insights into the taste and texture of a product.
Finally, many brands also offer sample packs, which allow you to try out different flavors and products before committing to a full-size purchase.

The bottom line
There are many  types of protein powder  available to fit nearly any preference or palate.

With a bit of savvy shopping, it’s easy to find a protein powder that tastes great and fits seamlessly into your diet.
The tastiest way of drinking protein powder is to add the liquid that you prefer. Some protein powders have suggestions for what makes it tastiest. For example, some might recommend adding in oat milk.
