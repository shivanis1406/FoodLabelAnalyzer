Title: How Many Calories Should You Eat Per Day to Lose Weight?

Your ideal calorie intake depends on various factors, such as age and activity level. Most females at least 1,600 daily calories to maintain weight, while males may require at least 2,000.
Reducing the number of calories you eat per day  can be  an effective weight loss method.
However, figuring out exactly how many calories you should eat can be tricky, as it depends on various factors, including your age, sex, size, and activity level.
Below is a simple scientific calorie calculator and five evidence-based tips on how to reduce your calorie intake sustainably.

How do I calculate how many calories I need?
Enter your details in the calculator below to see how many calories you need on a daily basis to maintain or lose weight.
The calculator is based on the Mifflin-St Jeor equation and  can estimate  your calorie needs. It utilizes population data, as well as other factors, including genetics, medications, and lean body mass, that affect your calorie needs.
This calculator estimates the number of calories you should eat daily to maintain your weight based on your age, size, sex, and activity level.
You can adjust this number based on your goals if you’re trying to gain or lose weight.
Keep in mind that this tool only provides general guidance, as activity levels and many other factors influence your daily calorie needs. This calculator will likely give a number close to your calorie needs, but it’s not a perfect tool.
Your doctor or dietitian can offer more individualized advice on your ideal calorie intake, depending on your health status and goals.

How many calories should you eat on average?
When trying to  lose weight , it’s important  to create  a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than usual or exercising more. Some people choose to combine the two, eating a little less while being more physically active.
However, it’s important to ensure that you’re consuming enough nutrients, even if you’re trying to lose weight. Otherwise, you risk developing  nutritional deficiencies  and  metabolic changes , making long-term weight maintenance difficult.
Here’s a closer look at calorie intake based on recommendations from the  2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans .
Keep in mind that these estimates don’t apply to those who are  pregnant  or  nursing , as they’ll need significantly more calories.
People who are very active or have certain health conditions may require more calories. The number you need within these ranges also varies based on your height and weight.
Keep in mind that cutting a child’s calorie intake  may increase  their risk of nutritional deficiencies, slow growth, and foster a challenging relationship with food or an eating disorder .
Instead of counting calories, it’s best to eat a balanced diet containing lots of nutrient-dense foods.
The number of calories that your body needs can vary depending on your age, sex, activity level, and body size.

What are calories?
Simply put, a calorie is a unit that measures energy. Calories measure the energy content of foods and beverages.
To lose weight, you need to eat fewer calories than your body burns each day. Conversely, you need to  consume more  calories than you expend to gain weight.
Keep in mind that while the “ calories in, calories out ” concept of weight loss may seem simple,  many factors  contribute to weight loss or the inability to lose weight, including medical diagnoses, hormonal changes, genetics, and age.
Calories are units that measure the energy content of foods and beverages. While many factors can influence weight loss, you generally need to eat fewer calories than you burn to lose weight.

How to reduce calorie intake
Although decreasing the number of calories you consume can lead to effective weight loss, cutting calories without considering which foods you eat isn’t a sustainable way to lose weight.
Here are five strategies that may help you lose weight.
When it comes to losing weight,  protein  is incredibly important.
According to a  2020 study , increasing your protein intake may help keep you full and curb your appetite.
Protein may also help fight  cravings . According to some  research , high protein snacks help enhance feelings of fullness while decreasing hunger and appetite.
In addition to promoting weight loss, some research suggests that maintaining a high protein diet  may prevent  or reduce weight regain and  help maintain  muscle mass.
Therefore, if you want to achieve long lasting, sustainable weight loss, consider increasing your  protein intake  by eating more eggs, meat, poultry, tofu, nuts, seeds, or legumes.
Another change you can make is to limit your intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, including sodas,  fruit juices , chocolate milk, and other drinks with added sugar.
Your brain doesn’t register liquid calories the same way it does solid calories, so they have a  less significant  effect on your feelings of hunger and fullness.
Additionally, studies associate drinking  sugary beverages  with an  increased risk  of obesity.
The harmful effects of sugar also go far beyond weight gain. In fact, added sugar may  contribute to  other health issues, including heart disease, liver problems, and diabetes.
One thing you can do for your health is to  drink more water .
Adequate hydration has associations with improved brain health, weight management, and a  reduced risk  of kidney stones.
What’s more, drinking water immediately before meals  may reduce  hunger and help you  eat fewer calories .
Drinking more water—especially before meals—may help you lose weight when combined with a balanced, nutritious diet.
Research has  shown  that resistance-training activities such as  weightlifting  limit muscle loss. This may help minimize metabolic changes during long-term calorie restriction.
Cardio exercises, such as walking, swimming, or jogging, are also important for  increasing weight loss  and supporting overall health .
Additionally, exercise has a variety of  other benefits  that go beyond weight loss, such as:
increased longevity
enhanced energy levels
improved mental health
decreased risk of chronic disease
The term “refined carbs” refers to grains that have lost their bran and germ. This includes products such as white bread, pasta, crackers, white rice, sugar, and other sweeteners.
Refined grains typically lack fiber,  which supports  weight loss by decreasing your appetite and increasing feelings of fullness.
Eating more  refined carbs  may hinder weight loss by  adversely influencing  levels of specific hormones that regulate your appetite, such as peptide YY .  It’s also best to avoid  ultra-processed foods .
Eating more protein, exercising, staying hydrated, and limiting your intake of refined carbs and sugary beverages are simple ways to decrease your daily calorie intake.

A few basic weight loss tips
In addition to cutting calories, there are several steps you can take to lose weight in a sustainable, long lasting manner:
Practice mindful eating.   Mindful eating  can  help reduce  food cravings and promote long-term weight loss.
Eat more fruits and vegetables.  Fruits and veggies are low in calories but high in fiber, which makes them  ideal for  weight loss.
Stock up on nutritious foods.  Following a weight loss diet is much more challenging when you have a kitchen full of processed foods. Make sure you have  healthy snacks  and foods on hand.
Find support.  Studies show that social support  may aid  weight loss.
Try meal prepping.  Many people find that  meal prepping  is a convenient way to eat well and save time.
In addition to decreasing your daily calorie intake, the tips outlined above may support long-term weight loss.

Potential downsides of counting calories
Although counting calories can be an effective strategy for weight loss, it’s important to remember that there are many other factors to consider when choosing what and how to eat.
Instead of focusing solely on calories, it’s best to follow a  balanced diet  rich in various nutritious, whole foods.
If you do decide to cut calories, be careful not to decrease your intake too much, as doing so  may cause  several serious  side effects .
Research shows that young adults who use calorie-tracking apps to monitor how many calories they consume may be  more at risk  for developing disordered eating patterns that could develop into eating disorders.
That said, restricting how much you eat can be a successful weight loss strategy for people who are not at risk for developing disordered eating habits, at least  in the short term . However, eating too few calories may also slow your metabolism,  making it harder  to maintain weight loss in the long term.
Cutting too many calories may harm your health and make it harder to maintain weight loss. Instead of focusing only on calories, concentrate on a well-rounded diet that’s rich in nutritious, whole foods.

Frequently asked questions
Below are some commonly asked questions about calories and weight loss.
Although it may help you lose weight, eating 1,200 calories or less a day does not provide enough energy or nutrients for most adults.
The number of calories you should eat for  breakfast  depends on many factors, including your daily needs, personal preferences, health goals, and overall diet.
While some people may enjoy eating a large lunch and smaller dinner, others may decide to distribute their calorie intake more evenly. Therefore, everyone’s needs and preferences are different.
To  gain muscle , you may need to increase your daily calorie needs by  a few hundred  calories. A sports dietitian can help you develop an appropriate plan.
The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  does not recommend losing 5 pounds (lb) a week. Instead, it recommends aiming for steady and gradual weight loss (about 1-2 lbs per week), which is more sustainable and will help you maintain weight loss.
In general, a female should limit their caloric intake to  1,500  or less in order to lose 1lb per week. The average male should eat 2,000 calories a day to lose this amount.
The number of calories that you should eat at each meal or to reach a specific weight goal can differ. Therefore, it’s best to experiment to find what suits your needs.
