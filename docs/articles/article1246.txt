Countless peanut butter options are available on grocery store shelves today, but not all of them are created equal when it comes to nutritional value.
Certain types are rich in unsaturated fats, protein, and fiber with minimal additives, while others are high in added sugar and ingredients that might be less nutritious.
You may wonder what the healthiest choices are when it comes to peanut butter.
This article explains how to choose a healthy peanut butter and lists five options that our dietitians and editors buy on a regular basis.

How we chose
We considered several factors when determining which products to feature, including:
Ingredients:  We chose peanut butters that contain minimal ingredients and are free of additives, preservatives, added sugar, and other sweeteners.
Nutritional content:  We selected varieties of peanut butter that are free of added sugar, low in sodium, and rich in protein and heart-healthy fats.
Taste:  Our dietitians and editors have taste tested all the peanut butters included in our list. The brands were selected for their flavor and texture.
Price:  We included peanut butter brands at a variety of price points to fit almost any budget.

General price ranges are indicated below with dollar signs ($ to $$$).
We based the price ratings on the approximate cost for a 16-ounce (480-gram) jar of peanut butter.
$  = under $3 per jar

It wasn’t easy picking a best overall healthy peanut butter, but Crazy Richard’s ultimately won out because it hits all the right notes: It’s made from just one simple ingredient —  peanuts  — tastes delicious, and is easy to find at most major grocery stores and online.
Healthline writer and registered dietitian Rachael Ajmera, MS, RD, vouched for Crazy Richards, “This peanut butter is one of my favorites, thanks to its rich, peanutty flavor and straightforward list of ingredients.”

The brand offers both creamy and crunchy versions, so you can pick based on your personal preferences. Additionally, it’s gluten-free and made without any added sugar or palm oil.
However, pantry peanut butter fans be warned, according to Ajmera, “It can get a little runny if you leave it out, so I recommend sticking it in the fridge if you prefer a thicker, more spreadable texture.”

Not only is this peanut butter one of the most affordable options on the market, but it’s also one of the healthiest.

It contains just salt and dry-roasted peanuts, which are roasted and ground with the skins still on. According to the company, this helps improve the flavor of the final product, which was confirmed by Healthline editor Chelsea Logan.
According to Logan, “I love this peanut butter! Peanut butter is one of my favorite foods, and I’ve tried a lot of different types, but I always come back to this one. I love that it only has two ingredients and that it only costs a couple dollars.
“It’s the perfect salt level — not too salty, but not bland. It definitely has a bold peanut flavor.”
As with others on our list, because this peanut butter is free of palm oil or other  hydrogenated oils , the oil can separate and simply needs to be stirred back in.

Peanut butter and jelly fans, this peanut butter is for you.

Instead, it contains just two simple ingredients, including fresh-roasted peanuts and a small amount of salt.

It’s also gluten-free, kosher, and widely available in both creamy and crunchy varieties.

Described as “the peanut butter for the everyperson, the proletariat’s peanut butter,” by our editor Crystal Hoshaw, Adams easily won our pick as the best peanut butter with an added crunch.

According to Hoshaw, “Adams peanut butter is my go-to affordable peanut butter with no extra stuff. No sugar, no preservatives, no stabilizers, no BS. I use it for dipping apple slices, thickening smoothies, and stuffing dates for a sweet and salty snack.”

Best organic peanut butter

In addition to being free of sugar and other additives, this peanut butter from Spread the Love is  certified organic  and made with organic peanuts.

It features just one ingredient — peanuts — and is also free of gluten and salt.
While she acknowledged that it isn’t cheap, Ajmera said that the peanut butter’s “rich taste and creamy consistency” make it well worth the cost.
“I like drizzling it over fresh fruit or using it in recipes that call for peanut butter because it’s easier to scoop and measure than many other brands.”
Similar to other natural peanut butters, it has a thin, slightly runny texture, so be sure to stir in the oil before eating.

Product comparison table
Here’s a closer look at how our top natural peanut butter picks compare:

What are the benefits of peanut butter?
Peanut butter  is a great source of several nutrients,  including :
heart-healthy fats
fiber
protein
B vitamins
magnesium
vitamin E
manganese
In addition to its nutritional benefits, peanut butter is also relatively easy to find, has a long shelf-life, and has affordable options.
For all of these reasons, peanut butter can be a convenient food to keep on hand for pairing with fiber-rich foods, like oatmeal, toast, and apples, to create a balanced meal or snack.

What makes a healthy peanut butter?
Some peanut butters — including ones with otherwise minimal ingredients — contain  palm oil .
Palm oil has a neutral flavor, and its main purpose is to prevent the natural separation of oils in the product. Although palm oil isn’t a hydrogenated  trans fat , there may be other concerns associated with its use and consumption.
For example, palm oil is high in saturated fat, which  can increase  levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol, a risk factor for  heart disease .
There are also some indirect public health effects of palm oil. Clearing forests for palm oil production causes air pollution that  increases  instances of skin, eye, and respiratory disease among nearby populations.
It also releases greenhouse gases and  destroys the habitats  of at-risk species.
While peanut butters that contain palm oil can still be a part of a nutritious diet, they may come with some other health considerations when choosing which peanut butter is best for you.
The natural oils found in many varieties of peanut butter tend to separate and float to the top, requiring a quick stir with a spoon or knife before you start spreading.
Try storing your jar of peanut butter upside down and shaking it before opening. This causes the oil to rise to the bottom. Mix the oil back into your peanut butter once you’re ready to use it.

Frequently asked questions
