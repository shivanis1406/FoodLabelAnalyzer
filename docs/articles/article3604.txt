Title: A Keto Diet Meal Plan and Menu for a Lower Carb Lifestyle

A ketogenic diet is a high fat and low carb diet. Reducing carbs may put your body in ketosis, which causes it to use fat for energy. This may help with weight loss.
If you find yourself in a conversation about dieting or weight loss, chances are you’ll hear about the ketogenic, or keto, diet. The keto diet has become one of the most popular methods worldwide among people trying to lose weight and improve their health.
If you’ve been thinking about trying the keto diet and have gotten the thumbs up from your healthcare professional, use this article to learn more about what to eat and what to limit while following a keto diet.

Ketogenic diet basics
The  keto diet , as a rule, is very low in carbs, high in fat, and moderate in protein. While you can eat some carbs, you’ll need to monitor your intake.
While different versions of the keto diet exist the  percentage  of calories a person will consume will be  approximately as follows :
carbs: 5–10%
fats: 70–75%
protein: 15–20%
This carb reduction forces your body to rely on fats for its main energy source instead of glucose — a process known as  ketosis .
While in ketosis, your body uses  ketones  — molecules produced in the liver from fats when glucose is limited — as an alternate fuel source. Plus, keto diets reduce hunger and increase satiety, which can be helpful when trying to lose weight.
Research  shows that ketogenic diets are effective at promoting weight loss — though they may be no more effective than other  weight-loss diets .
The ketogenic diet relies on a very low carb routine. Carbs are typically restricted to  20–50 grams  per day on a 2,000-calorie diet. Instead, you’d eat mostly fat and protein.

Ketogenic diet meal plan
Switching to a ketogenic diet may seem overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be difficult. Your focus should be on reducing carbs while increasing the fat and protein content of meals and snacks. Some online tools and  calculators  can be helpful.
In order to reach and remain in a state of ketosis, carbs must be restricted. While certain people might only achieve ketosis by eating 20 grams of carbs per day, others may be successful with a higher carb intake.
Generally, the lower your carbohydrate intake, the easier it is to  reach and stay in ketosis .
This is why sticking to  keto-friendly foods  and avoiding items rich in carbs is the best way to successfully lose weight on a ketogenic diet.
When following a ketogenic diet, meals and snacks should center around the following foods:
Eggs:   pastured , organic, or conventional all work fine
Poultry:  chicken and turkey
Fatty fish:  salmon, herring, and mackerel
Meat:  beef, venison, pork, organ meats, and bison
Full-fat dairy:  unsweetened yogurt, butter, and cream, but check the labels as dairy does contain some carbs
Full-fat cheese:  cheddar, mozzarella, brie, goat cheese, and cream cheese
Nuts and seeds:  macadamia nuts, almonds, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, peanuts, and  flaxseeds
Nut butter:  no-sugar-added peanut, almond, and cashew butters
Oils rich in healthy fats:  olive oil, avocado oil, and sesame oil
Avocados:  whole avocados can be added to almost any meal or snack
Non-starchy vegetables:  greens, broccoli, tomatoes, mushrooms, and peppers
Condiments:  salt, pepper, vinegar, lemon juice, fresh herbs, and spices
When possible, it’s best to avoid or limit foods rich in carbs while following a keto diet.
The following foods should be limited:
Bread and baked goods:  white bread, whole wheat bread, crackers, cookies, doughnuts, and rolls
Sweets and sugary foods:  sugar, ice cream, candy, maple syrup, honey,  agave syrup , and coconut sugar
Sweetened beverages:  soda, juice, sweetened teas, and sports drinks
Pasta:  spaghetti and other noodles
Grains and grain products:  wheat, rice, oats, breakfast cereals, and tortillas
Starchy vegetables:  potatoes, sweet potatoes, butternut squash, corn, peas, and pumpkin
Beans and legumes:  black beans, chickpeas, lentils, and kidney beans
Fruit:  citrus, grapes, bananas, and pineapple
High carb sauces:  barbecue sauce, ketchup, honey mustard, sugary salad dressings, and dipping sauces
Certain alcoholic beverages:  beer and sugary mixed drinks
Though carbs should be restricted, you can eat them in small amounts while monitoring your intake.
For instance, you can enjoy low glycemic fruits, such as berries, in limited amounts as long as you’re maintaining a keto-friendly range of macronutrients (carbs, protein, fat).
Be sure to choose plenty of whole foods and steer clear of  processed foods  and trans fats when possible.
Sugar can be found in a wide variety of beverages including juice, soda, iced tea, and coffee drinks. While on a ketogenic diet, you should limit or avoid high carb drinks, just like  high carb foods .
Sugary beverages  have also been linked  to various health concerns — from obesity to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
There are many tasty sugar-free options for those on the keto diet. Keto-friendly beverage choices include:
Water.  Water is the best choice for hydration and should be consumed throughout the day.
Sparkling water.  Sparkling water can make an excellent soda replacement.
Unsweetened coffee.  Try using heavy cream to add flavor to your cup of coffee.
Unsweetened green tea.   Green tea  is delicious and may provide many health benefits.
If you want to add some extra flavor to your water, try experimenting with different keto-friendly flavor combinations. For example, tossing some fresh mint and a lemon peel into your water bottle can make hydration a breeze.
Though alcohol should be restricted, enjoying an occasional low carb drink like vodka or tequila mixed with soda water is acceptable on the keto diet.
The ketogenic diet revolves around high fat, low carb food choices and limits highly processed foods and trans fats. Keto-friendly beverage options should be sugar-free when possible. Consider water, sparkling water, or unsweetened green tea and coffee.

A sample keto menu for 1 week
The following menu provides fewer than 50 grams of total carbs per day. As mentioned above, some people may have to reduce carbohydrates even further in order to reach ketosis.
This is a general, 1-week ketogenic menu that can be altered depending on individual dietary needs.
Breakfast:  two eggs fried in butter served with sauteed greens
Lunch:  a bunless burger topped with cheese, mushrooms, and avocado atop a bed of greens
Dinner:  pork chops with green beans sauteed in olive oil
Breakfast:  mushroom omelet
Lunch:  tuna salad with celery and tomato atop a bed of greens
Dinner:  roast chicken with cream sauce and sauteed broccoli

As you can see,  ketogenic meals  can be diverse and flavorful.
Although many ketogenic meals are based around animal products, there are vegetarian options. However, following a keto vegetarian diet will be more challenging, as the choice of foods will be less varied.
Anyone following a keto diet should aim for as much variety as possible in their ingredients to reduce the risk of nutritional deficiencies.
If you’re following a more liberal ketogenic diet, adding a cup of berries to your breakfast or a small serving of a starchy vegetable to your dinner will increase the number of carbs in this meal plan.
A ketogenic meal plan, like any nutritious diet, should include whole foods and many fiber-rich, low carb vegetables. Choose healthy fats like sesame oil, avocado oil, olive oil, and butter to increase the fat content of dishes.

Ketogenic snack options
Snacking between meals can help moderate hunger and keep you on track while following a ketogenic diet.
Here are some excellent, keto-friendly snack options:
almonds and cheddar cheese
half an  avocado  stuffed with chicken salad
guacamole with low carb veggies
trail mix made with unsweetened coconut, nuts, and seeds
hard-boiled eggs
coconut chips
kale  chips
olives and sliced salami
celery and peppers with herbed cream cheese dip
berries with heavy whipping cream
jerky
cheese roll-ups
Parmesan crisps
macadamia nuts
greens with high fat dressing and avocado
keto smoothie made with coconut milk, cocoa, and avocado
avocado cocoa mousse
No matter which diet you are following, it’s important to eat the appropriate number of calories based on your activity level, weight loss goal, age, and gender. Working with a nutritionist can help you make sure you get the proper amount of nutrients and calories for your personal goals or health history.
Keto-friendly snacks should be high in fat, moderate in protein, and low in carbs. You can increase your fiber intake by snacking on sliced, low carb vegetables with a high fat dipping sauce.

A simple ketogenic shopping list
A well-rounded ketogenic diet should include lots of fresh produce, healthy fats, and proteins.
Choosing a mixture of both fresh and frozen produce will ensure that you have a supply of keto-friendly vegetables and fruits to add to recipes.
The following is a simple ketogenic shopping list that can guide you when perusing the grocery aisles:
Meat and poultry:  beef, chicken, turkey, and pork

Preparing a shopping list can help you decide what foods will fit into your ketogenic meal plan. Fill your cart with meat, poultry, eggs, low carb veggies, full-fat dairy, and healthy fats.

Benefits of the keto diet
Some  research  suggests that adopting this low carb, high fat diet may  promote  weight loss and  improve  glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes.
The keto diet may also  have neuroprotective effects  and help  improve cognitive function  in people with Alzheimer’s disease, though more research is needed.

Drawbacks and risks
While the keto diet does seem to have some benefits, it is unlikely to be suitable in the long term. There are some risks and possible drawbacks for people on the keto diet.
Keto Flu:  this includes a  range of symptoms  that can develop when starting a ketogenic diet. This can feel similar to the flu, and it’s caused by the body adapting to a new diet consisting of very little carbohydrates. Your body enters a process known as  ketosis , which may cause you to experience other symptoms that include leg cramps, digestive issues, and bad breath. Ketosis is  safe and healthy , but may not be for everyone.
Weight regain:  While it may help you lose weight, stopping can lead to weight regain.
Not for everyone:  The keto diet is  not recommended  for everyone. This may include people with kidney failure or liver disease, as well as type 1 diabetes as it can lead to diabetes-related ketoacidosis. Make sure to consult your healthcare team before beginning the keto diet.
Cholesterol impact:  A keto diet is typically high in  saturated fat  and trans fats. These can  raise LDL  (“bad”) cholesterol in some individuals, which may  increase the risk  of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke.
Fiber and vitamins:  It can also be low in vegetables, grains, and legumes, meaning you may not get enough fiber and B vitamins to maintain essential body functions.
Restrictive:  The diet is very restrictive and needs careful planning, which makes it hard to sustain. The lack of diversity can lead not only to nutritional deficiencies but also boredom. It can affect social events, as eating out becomes more difficult.
Pregnancy and nursing parents:  It  may not be safe  for those who are pregnant or nursing.
For these reasons, it’s best to check with a health professional before trying a keto diet.
A ketogenic diet may help manage weight and glucose levels, among other benefits. However, it also involves a high fat intake, and may not be suitable for everyone.

Frequently asked questions
Depending on the precise keto diet you choose, carbs will make up 5–10%, fats 70–75%, and protein 15–20%. Examples of foods you can eat would be a mushroom omelette, chicken curry, yogurt, nuts, and seeds. It’s best to get your carbs from fruits or low-carb vegetables.
People who follow a keto diet focus mainly on high-quality fats and proteins while keeping carb intake to 5–10% of their total calories. To benefit from the diet, you’d need to opt for less processed foods such as nuts and fresh fish.

Bottom line
Ketogenic diets vary but will consist of about 70–75% fat, 15–20% protein, and 5–10% of carbs per day.
Focus on high fat,  low carb foods  like eggs, meats, dairy, and low carb vegetables, as well as sugar-free beverages. Be sure to limit highly processed foods and trans fats.
