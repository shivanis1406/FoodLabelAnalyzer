Title: What You Need to Know About the Health Benefits of Collagen

Collagen is a key component in bones, skin, muscles, and other body parts. It may help improve skin health, relieve joint pain, and prevent bone loss, among other things.
Collagen is a protein. Your body makes it, and it’s important for healthy joints, skin, bones, muscles, and more. But as you age — just when it’s harder for your body to make collagen — the collagen you have begins to break down. So, you may be considering collagen supplements and wondering how much they really help.
Here are 9 science-backed health benefits of taking collagen.

What is collagen?
Collagen is the  most abundant  protein in your body. It’s the main component of connective tissues that make up several body parts, including tendons, ligaments, skin, and muscles. It has many important functions, including providing your skin with structure and strengthening your bones.
You can get collagen from foods like pork skin and bone broth, but collagen supplements have also become popular. Most are hydrolyzed, which means the collagen has been broken down to make it easier to absorb.
These supplements come primarily in powder form but are also available in capsules. The types of collagen found in supplements vary — some contain one or two types, while others contain up to five.
Collagen is the most abundant protein in your body. You can increase your intake of collagen by taking supplements or eating animal foods and bone broth. However, absorption from food may not be as efficient as from supplements.

What are the benefits of taking collagen?
Collagen supplementation provides a variety of health benefits.
Collagen is a major component of your skin. It plays a role in strengthening skin, as well as in elasticity and hydration. As you age, your body  produces less collagen , leading to dry skin and the formation of wrinkles.
Several studies have shown that collagen peptides or supplements containing collagen may help slow the aging of your  skin  by reducing wrinkles and dryness. One  review of 26 studies  focusing mostly on women found that taking 1–12 grams of collagen per day for 4–12 weeks led to improvements in skin elasticity and hydration.
These supplements  may work  by stimulating your body to produce  collagen  and other proteins that help structure your skin, including elastin and fibrillin.
There are also many anecdotal claims that collagen supplements help prevent acne and other skin conditions, but these aren’t supported by scientific evidence.

As you age, the amount of collagen in your body decreases, and your  risk increases  for joint disorders such as  osteoarthritis . Some studies suggest that collagen supplements  may help improve  symptoms of osteoarthritis and reduce overall joint pain.
A review of studies in people with osteoarthritis found that taking collagen led to  significant improvements  in joint stiffness but not pain or functional limitation.
Researchers suggest supplemental collagen may accumulate in cartilage and stimulate your tissues to make collagen which  may lead to  lower inflammation, better joint support, and reduced pain. But evidence is needed to recommend collagen as a treatment for osteoarthritis.
Your bones are made mostly of collagen. As you age, collagen deteriorates, and your bone mass decreases. This  may lead to  conditions such as osteoporosis, which is characterized by low bone density and a higher risk of bone fractures.
Research suggests  collagen supplements may help inhibit the bone breakdown that leads to osteoporosis.
In a 12-month study of postmenopausal women, some took a calcium and vitamin D supplement with 5 grams of collagen and others took a calcium and vitamin D supplement with no collagen daily.
Those taking the calcium, vitamin D, and collagen supplement had  significantly lower  blood levels of proteins that promote bone breakdown and less loss of mineral bone density than those who took only the calcium and vitamin D.
Another study found similar results in 66 postmenopausal women who took 5 grams of collagen daily for 12 months. Participants who took the collagen had an  increase of up to 7%  in their bone mineral density (BMD), a measure of the density of minerals in bones.
However, more human studies are needed.
As the most abundant protein in the body, collagen is an important component of skeletal muscle.
In a 12-week study, 26 older men with sarcopenia took 15 grams of collagen while participating in an exercise program. Compared to men who exercised but didn’t take collagen, they  gained significantly more muscle mass  and strength.
However, more research is necessary to prove collagen’s potential to  boost muscle mass .
Researchers have theorized that collagen supplements may help reduce the risk of heart conditions.
Collagen provides structure to your arteries, the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to the rest of your body.
Without enough collagen, arteries may become less flexible and elastic, which may lead to atherosclerosis, a disease characterized by the narrowing of your arteries. This condition may cause  heart attack  and stroke.
In a 6-month study, 30 healthy adults took 16 grams of collagen daily. They had experienced a significant reduction in measures of artery stiffness from the study’s beginning to its end ( 18 ).
Additionally, their levels of HDL (good) cholesterol rose by an  average of 6% . HDL is an important factor in the risk of heart conditions, including atherosclerosis, though more research is needed.
Although no randomized controlled trials support this claim, some health professionals report that collagen supplements can treat  leaky gut syndrome , also called intestinal permeability. Individuals report collagen helps, but research is needed.
Taking collagen may  increase the strength  of your nails. While more research is needed to support collagen’s effect on hair, people report that  taking collagen may help your hair  avoid breaking as easily.
While no studies have examined the role of collagen supplements in brain health, some people claim that they improve mood and reduce anxiety symptoms.
Proponents believe that collagen supplements may promote weight loss and  faster metabolism . However, no studies support these claims. Although these potential effects are promising, more research is needed before formal conclusions can be made.

What are the side effects of taking collagen?
While collagen supplements are generally well tolerated with few reported side effects, many are made from  common food allergens , such as fish, shellfish, and eggs. People with allergies to these foods should avoid collagen supplements made with these ingredients.
Some people report nausea, bloating, and  heartburn  when taking collagen supplements, but  research  has not consistently shown these as side effects.

What foods are rich in collagen?
Collagen may be found in or derived from animal products. Foods that contain collagen include:
gelatin
bone broth
connective tissues of animals
chicken skin
pork skin
beef
fish
Vitamin C is crucial for collagen synthesis. There are many foods that are  high in Vitamin C , like citrus fruits, broccoli, strawberries, and many others.

What are the alternatives to animal-based collagen?
Because collagen’s amino acid composition differs from those of other proteins, the possible alternatives are limited.  Vegan collagen  can be made from genetically modified yeast and bacteria, which contain proteins similar to collagen. These are being investigated as potential collagen sources.
A nutritionally balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and plant-based protein foods  may help boost  the body’s production of collagen.

Frequently asked questions
Collagen turnover is a slow process. Most studies use a minimum of 8 weeks to assess collagen’s effects on skin health and joint pain relief, but  other studies  use longer periods, such as 12 months, for bone health.
It’s probably fine to take supplements containing collagen daily, and few side effects have been reported.
If you have kidney stones or are at risk for them, you may want to  avoid collagen  supplements. They contain an amino acid called hydroxyproline that is converted into oxalate in your body. Too much oxalate may lead to kidney stones.

The bottom line
Collagen supplements are associated with several health benefits and very few known risks. Supplements may increase muscle mass, prevent bone loss, relieve joint pain, and improve skin health by reducing wrinkles and dryness.
While other benefits may exist, most claims about weight loss, gut health, and brain health aren’t backed by research. Although  several foods contain collagen , it’s unknown whether these foods offer the same benefits as supplements.
