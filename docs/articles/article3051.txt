Title: Health Benefits and Nutrition Facts About Dragon Fruit

Dragon fruit, also known as pitahaya or strawberry pear, is a low calorie tropical fruit known for its vibrant red skin and sweet, seed-speckled pulp. It contains nutrients, prebiotic fibers, and other healthy substances.
Its unique look and acclaimed superfood powers have made it popular among foodies and the health-conscious.
But you don’t have to live in the tropics to enjoy the many benefits of dragon fruit. In fact, you can find it fresh or frozen in supermarkets worldwide.
Here are 7 health benefits of dragon fruit, all based on evidence.

1. High in nutrients
Dragon fruit is low in calories but packed with essential vitamins and minerals. It also contains a substantial amount of dietary fiber.
Here’s a rundown of the main nutrients in a  one-cup serving (180 grams (g)).
Calories:  103
Protein:  0.6 g
Fat:  0.2 g
Carbohydrates:  27.4 g
Fiber:  5.6 g
Iron:  0.324 milligrams (mg)
Magnesium:  12.6 mg
Vitamin C:  7.7 mg
Vitamin E:  0.2 mg
You can check the  Dietary Guidelines for Americans  for recommended values for these nutrients, which you need to eat daily depending on your age and sex.
Beyond essential nutrients, dragon fruit  supplies  beneficial plant compounds like polyphenols, carotenoids, and betacyanins.

2. May help fight chronic disease
Free radicals are unstable molecules that cause cell damage, which may lead to inflammation and disease.
One way to combat this is by eating  antioxidant-rich foods  like dragon fruit.
Antioxidants work by neutralizing free radicals, thus preventing cell damage and inflammation.
Studies suggest that diets high in antioxidants  may help  prevent chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and arthritis.
Dragon fruit contains  several types  of potent antioxidants, including  vitamin C  and  carotenoids .
Importantly, antioxidants work best when eaten naturally in food rather than in pill form or as a supplement. In fact, antioxidant supplements  may have harmful  effects, and taking them without medical supervision is not recommended.

3. Loaded with fiber
Dietary fibers are nondigestible carbohydrates that boast an extensive list of potential  health benefits .
Although fiber is probably best known for its role in digestion,  research  has suggested it may also protect against diseases and health conditions such as heart disease or type 2 diabetes and help maintain healthy body weight.
Although more research is needed, some  studies  also suggest that diets high in fiber may protect against colon cancer.
While no studies have linked dragon fruit directly to any of these conditions, its high fiber content can help you meet your recommended daily values.
However, it’s important to note that high fiber diets can have drawbacks, especially if you’re accustomed to a low fiber diet. To avoid stomach discomfort, gradually increase your dietary fiber intake and drink plenty of fluids.

4. Promotes a healthy gut
Your gut is home to some  100 trillion  diverse microorganisms
Many researchers believe this community of microorganisms may  impact your health . Both human and animal studies have  associated  imbalances in your gut with conditions like heart disease.
Since dragon fruit  contains  prebiotics, it may help improve the balance of good bacteria in your gut.
Prebiotics  are a specific type of fiber that promotes the growth of healthy bacteria in your gut. Like all fibers, your gut cannot break them down. However, the bacteria in your gut can digest them. They use the fiber as fuel for growth, and you reap the benefits.
Regular consumption of prebiotics may  help reduce the risk  of digestive tract infections and diarrhea. Prebiotics promote the growth of good bacteria, which researchers believe may outcompete the bad.
While much of the research on prebiotics is favorable, more studies are needed to determine the true effect of dragonfruit specifically on the human gut.

5. Strengthens your immune system
Your body’s ability to fight infection is determined by several different factors, including the quality of your diet.
The vitamin C and carotenoids in dragon fruit  may help boost  your immune system and  prevent infection  by protecting your white blood cells from damage.
The white blood cells in your immune system attack and destroy harmful substances. However, they are extremely sensitive to damage by free radicals.
Vitamin C and carotenoids are potent antioxidants that can help neutralize free radicals and defend white blood cells against harm.

6. May boost low iron levels
Dragon fruit is one of the few fresh fruits that contain iron.
Iron is  crucial  for transporting oxygen throughout the body and for breaking down food into energy.
But, many people do not get enough iron. In fact, it has been estimated that around  17%  of the world’s population is  deficient in iron .
To combat low iron levels, it’s important to consume a variety of  iron-rich foods . Rich sources of iron include meats, fish, legumes, nuts, and cereals. Dragon fruit may be another great option.

7. Good source of magnesium
Dragon fruit offers more  magnesium  than most fruits. On average, your body contains  25 g  of magnesium or roughly one ounce.
Despite this seemingly small amount, the mineral plays a crucial role in over  300  enzyme systems in our bodies. It helps with important functions like making proteins, keeping our muscles and nerves working properly, controlling blood sugar levels, and regulating blood pressure.
For example, it participates in reactions needed for the breakdown of food into energy, muscle contraction, bone formation, and even the creation of DNA.
More studies are needed, but some indicate that higher intakes of magnesium  may help reduce  the risk of heart disease, as well as  diabetes and stroke .

How to eat dragon fruit
While dragon fruit’s thick, leathery skin can be intimidating, eating this fruit is quite simple.
The trick is finding one that is perfectly ripe.
An unripe dragon fruit will be green. Look for one that is bright red. Some spots are normal, but too many bruise-like splotches can indicate that it’s overripe. Like avocado and kiwi, a ripe dragon fruit should be soft but not mushy.
Here’s how to eat a fresh dragon fruit:
Using a sharp knife, cut it in half lengthwise.
Scoop out the fruit with a spoon, or cut it into cubes by cutting vertical and horizontal lines into the pulp without cutting into the peel. Push on the back of the skin to expose the cubes, and remove them with a spoon or your fingers.
To enjoy, add it to salads, smoothies, and yogurt, or simply snack on it by itself.
You can also find dragon fruit in the frozen section of some grocery stores, pre-peeled and cut into cubes. This is a convenient option for a tasty snack that packs a nutrient-dense punch.

Frequently asked questions
Although more research is needed,  studies  suggest the antioxidants and nutrients in dragonfruit may help protect against various health issues, including helping lower blood sugar, supporting the heart, liver, and brain, and potentially reducing the risk of certain cancers.
You can eat dragon fruit any time of day. That said, it’s typically in season from  June through September.

Takeaway
Dragon fruit is a delicious tropical fruit that’s definitely worth trying.
It tastes amazing,  adds a pop of color to your plate, and supplies essential nutrients, prebiotic fibers, and beneficial plant compounds — all in a low calorie serving.
If you’re looking for a way to add some variety to your  fruit intake , dragon fruit is a delicious option with many potential health benefits.
