Title: 7 Health and Nutrition Benefits of Potatoes

Potatoes contain antioxidants and supply beneficial vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, B6, and potassium. They may also benefit your digestive health.
Potatoes are a versatile root vegetable and a staple food in many households.
They are an underground tuber that grows on the roots of the  Solanum tuberosum  plant ( 1 ) .
Potatoes are relatively cheap, easy to grow and packed with a variety of nutrients.
Here are 7 health and nutrition benefits of potatoes.

1. Packed With Nutrients
Potatoes are an excellent source of many vitamins and minerals.
One medium baked potato (6.1 ounces or 173 grams), including the skin, provides ( 2 ):
Calories:  161
Fat:  0.2 grams
Protein:  4.3 grams
Carbs:  36.6 grams
Fiber:  3.8 grams
Vitamin C:  28% of the RDI
Vitamin B6:  27% of the RDI
Potassium:  26% of the RDI
Manganese:  19% of the RDI
Magnesium:  12% of the RDI
Phosphorus:  12% of the RDI
Niacin:  12% of the RDI
Folate:  12% of the RDI
The nutritional content of potatoes can vary depending on the variety and how they are prepared. For example, frying potatoes adds more calories and fat than baking them.
It’s also important to note the skin of the potatoes contains a great amount of the vitamins and minerals. Peeling potatoes can significantly reduce their nutritional content ( 1 ,  3 ).
Summary  Potatoes are packed with  vitamins and minerals, though the variety and preparation method can affect the  nutritional content.

2. Contain Antioxidants
Potatoes are rich in compounds like flavonoids, carotenoids and phenolic acids ( 4 ).
These compounds act as  antioxidants  in the body by neutralizing potentially harmful molecules known as free radicals. When free radicals accumulate, they can increase the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes and cancer ( 5 ).
For example, a test-tube study found that the antioxidants present in potatoes may suppress the growth of liver and colon cancer cells ( 6 ).
Studies have also found that colored potatoes like purple potatoes can have three to four times more antioxidants than white potatoes. This makes them potentially more effective at neutralizing free radicals ( 7 ,  8 ).
However, most of this evidence is from test-tube studies. More human-based research is necessary before making any health recommendations.
Summary  Potatoes are a good  source of antioxidants, which may reduce the risk of chronic diseases like  heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers. However, more human-based research  is required before making any recommendations.

3. May Improve Blood Sugar Control
Potatoes contain a special type of starch known as  resistant starch .
This starch is not broken down and fully absorbed by the body. Instead, it reaches the large intestine where it becomes a source of nutrients for the beneficial bacteria in your gut ( 9 ).
Research has linked resistant starch to many health benefits, including reducing insulin resistance, which, in turn, improves blood sugar control.
In an animal study, mice fed resistant starch showed reduced insulin resistance. This means their bodies were more efficient at removing excess sugar from the blood ( 10 ).
A study of people with type 2 diabetes found consuming a meal with resistant starch helped better remove excess blood sugar after a meal ( 11 ).
In another study, ten people were fed 30 grams of resistant starch daily over a four-week period. Scientists found that resistant starch reduced insulin resistance by 33% ( 12 ).
Interestingly, you can also increase the resistant starch content of potatoes. To do this, store boiled potatoes in the fridge overnight and  consume them cold  ( 13 ).
Summary  Potatoes contain  resistant starch, which may help reduce insulin resistance. In turn, this can  help improve blood sugar control.

4. May Improve Digestive Health
The resistant starch in potatoes may also improve digestive health.
When resistant starch reaches the large intestine, it becomes food for beneficial gut bacteria. These bacteria digest it and turn it into  short-chain fatty acids  ( 14 ).
Resistant starch from potatoes is mostly converted into the short-chain fatty acid butyrate — the preferred food source for gut bacteria ( 15 ,  16 ).
Studies have shown that butyrate can reduce inflammation in the colon, strengthen the colon’s defenses and reduce the risk of colorectal cancer ( 17 ).
Moreover, butyrate may aid patients with inflammatory bowel disorders, such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and diverticulitis ( 18 ).
That said, most of the evidence surrounding butyrate is from test-tube or animal studies. More human-based research is necessary before making recommendations.
Summary  Resistant starch in  potatoes is a source of nutrition for beneficial gut bacteria. They convert it  to the short-chain fatty acid butyrate, which has been linked to reduced  inflammation in the colon, improved colon defenses and a lower risk of  colorectal cancer.

5. Naturally Gluten-Free
The  gluten-free diet  is one of the most popular diets worldwide. It involves eliminating gluten, which is a family of proteins found in grains like spelt, wheat, barley and rye.
Most people do not experience adverse symptoms from consuming gluten.
However, people with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity can experience severe discomfort when consuming foods that contain gluten. Symptoms include sharp stomach pain, diarrhea, constipation, bloating and skin rashes, just to name a few ( 19 ,  20 ).
If you follow a gluten-free diet, then you should consider adding potatoes to your diet. They are naturally gluten-free, which means they won’t trigger uncomfortable symptoms.
While potatoes are gluten-free, many common potato recipes are not. Some potato dishes that contain gluten include certain au gratin recipes and potato bread.
If you have celiac disease or a non-celiac gluten sensitivity, be sure to read the full list of ingredients before eating a potato dish.
Summary  Potatoes are naturally  gluten-free, which makes them an excellent food choice for people with celiac  disease or a non-celiac gluten sensitivity.

6. Incredibly Filling
Aside from being nutritious, potatoes are also  incredibly filling .
In one study, 11 people were fed 38 common foods and asked to rate foods based on how filling they were. Potatoes received the highest fullness rating of them all.
In fact, potatoes were rated as being seven times more filling than croissants, which were ranked as the least filling food item ( 21 ).
Foods that are filling may help you regulate or lose weight, as they curb hunger pains ( 22 ).
Some evidence shows that a certain potato protein, known as potato proteinase inhibitor 2 (PI2), can curb appetite. This protein appears to enhance the release of cholecystokinin (CCK), a hormone that promotes feelings of fullness ( 23 ).
Summary  Studies have shown that  potatoes are among the most filling foods. They may increase the levels of  fullness hormones, such as cholecystokinin (CCK).

7. Extremely Versatile
Not only are  potatoes  healthy, but they are also delicious and versatile.
Potatoes can be prepared in many ways, including boiled, baked and steamed. However, frying potatoes may dramatically increase their calorie content if you use a lot of oil.
Instead, try slicing potatoes and then roasting them in the oven with a light drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of rosemary.
Make sure not to remove the skin of the potatoes, as most of the nutrients are located there. This will ensure you receive the maximum amount of nutrients from the potato.
Summary  Potatoes are delicious,  versatile and easy to add to your diet. Try boiling, baking or steaming them  and consuming them with the skin intact.

How to Peel Potatoes

The Bottom Line
Potatoes are rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, which make them very healthy.
Studies have linked potatoes and their nutrients to a variety of impressive health benefits, including improved blood sugar control, reduced heart disease risk and higher immunity. They may also improve digestive health and combat signs of aging.
Potatoes are also quite filling, which means they may help you lose weight by curbing hunger pains and cravings.
All in all, potatoes are a great addition to your diet in moderation. They are also naturally gluten-free, which means they can be enjoyed by almost everyone.
