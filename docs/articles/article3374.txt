As a woman over 50 years old, minding your health and longevity requires different nutrients than in your younger years since your body is experiencing:
reduced nutrient absorption
metabolic shifts
declining bone density
Although it’s possible to meet most nutritional needs through diet, getting all the necessary nutrients from food alone may be difficult. A complete multivitamin can help fill the gap, especially when specifically formulated for your age bracket.
Here are the best multivitamins for women over 50 years old.

Why we chose it
Thorne Women’s Multi 50+ wins our top spot for being an iron-free, complete multivitamin that contains highly absorbable forms of important  nutrients  for women, including:
magnesium
vitamin B12
vitamin B6
vitamin D
a small amount of calcium
It also provides  lutein , a carotenoid antioxidant that supports brain and eye function.  Research  has also shown that higher levels of lutein levels may be correlated with better cognition.
Thorne also wins Healthline’s vote as  best vitamin brand , for the high quality of its supplements, which are made with pure ingredients and free of contaminants, fillers, and heavy metals.
“I liked everything about Thorne Women’s Multi 50+ except having to take six capsules a day. For me, it was too many pills, so I tended to split it into three in the early morning and three mid-morning. As someone who doesn’t love taking pills, the capsules themselves weren’t off-putting, but having to down that many was.
“As I hit 50+, the things that became more important for me were bone and brain health, along with hormone support and eye health. This product provides a pretty full-spectrum array of essential nutrients for healthy aging, and at optimal doses.
“I felt good in the 30 days that I took these multivitamins. My energy, mood, and focus were strong and even. My sleep and digestion were also better than normal.”

Why we chose it
This doctor-formulated, certified gluten-free multivitamin contains absorbable forms of vitamins and minerals, including:
methylated folate
vitamin B12
vitamin D
It’s our pick for the best multivitamin for  postmenopausal women  because it boasts ingredients like  green tea extract , which has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and  may support  healthy aging.
Plus, it provides absorbable forms of vitamin D and B12, which are important for postmenopausal women. Women over 50 years old are more likely to develop deficiencies in vitamin D and B12, so supplementing with these nutrients will give you extra assurance that you’re meeting your daily needs for these essential vitamins.

Why we chose it
If you prefer to follow an organic diet, New Chapter Every Woman’s One Daily 55+ is worth considering, thanks to its use of organic ingredients like vegetables and herbs.
It’s also a sound option for  best organic multivitamin for women over 50  because it’s iron-free and provides vitamins and minerals that are particularly important during this stage of life, including:
selenium
vitamin B6
vitamin B12
Unlike many other supplements that require multiple pill doses, New Chapter Every Woman’s One Daily 55+ has a recommended dose of just one tablet, which some people may prefer.
Though it’s well-rounded, it’s important to note that some of the nutrient forms used in New Chapter Every Woman’s One Daily 55+, including  magnesium oxide  and  zinc oxide , may be less bioavailable to the body.
This multivitamin is also quite low in magnesium, providing just 2% of the daily value per serving, so you may need to take a separate  magnesium supplement  if you’re not getting enough magnesium from your diet.
Lastly, keep in mind that while New Chapter supplements are tested throughout manufacturing to ensure purity and potency, many products, including this one, are only tested in-house and not by third-party labs.

What to look for when shopping
When shopping for the best multivitamin, it’s best to first consult a healthcare professional to understand any specific nutrient needs that you might have. Additional factors to consider when searching for the best supplements include quality, formulation, and your personal needs and preferences.
There’s no shortage of supplement companies to choose from. Because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t regulate supplements the same way it does pharmaceuticals, it’s important to purchase from vitamin brands that are known for producing high quality products.
Ideally, the best supplements have been tested by accredited third-party labs, like:
UL Solutions
US Pharmacopeia (USP)
NSF International
These organizations help ensure that the contents of your supplement bottle match what’s listed on the label — and contain nothing more.
In looking for the best multivitamin for over 50, you may choose a supplement that contains nutrients of special importance for women in that age group, such as B12, B6, vitamin D, zinc, and magnesium. Sometimes, looking for the best multivitamin for females over 40 opens up a wider selection.
Remember that women with suboptimal vitamin D levels and those deficient in vitamin D  may require much higher doses  of this nutrient to reach and maintain optimal levels.
If you’re concerned about your vitamin D levels, have a healthcare professional test them before taking them. Depending on your level, they can recommend an appropriate and effective supplemental daily dose.
Likewise, women deficient in vitamin B12  may require high dose vitamin B12 injections  to reach optimal B12 levels, which is why it’s important to have a doctor test your B12 levels.
Because many good multivitamins are available, your final decision on the best multivitamin for over 50 ultimately comes down to which product best fits your needs and preferences. Some factors to consider include:
Supplement form:  Are you OK with swallowing pills or need a chewable or gummy form instead?
Daily dose:  Are you OK with taking multiple pills per day? Or do you prefer a one-day formulation?
Dietary needs:  Do you follow a special diet, such as gluten-free or vegan? If so, you’ll want to choose a compliant product.
Budget:  Find a meeting ground where the best budget vitamin coincides with the one that best meets your needs. How much are you willing and able to spend on a multivitamin every month?
Availability:  Do you prefer to order supplements online? Or do you want a product you can pick up at your local grocery store?

How nutrient needs for women change after 50
As women grow older, their nutritional needs change.
For example, women over 50 require lower amounts of certain nutrients, like iron. However, they are at a higher risk of developing deficiencies in several other vitamins and minerals, like vitamin B12.
Here are a few nutrients that are particularly important for females over 50 years old:
Vitamin B6:   Vitamin B6  is a nutrient for cognitive health and metabolism. A person’s needs increase with age due to decreased absorption, increased breakdown, impaired nutrient activation, and decreased intake of B6-rich foods. Studies suggest that maintaining optimal levels can help  promote cognitive function  and prevent cognitive decline in older adults.
Calcium:  Women over the age of 50 have greater calcium needs than younger women. However, while calcium supplements could be helpful for certain women, such as those with bone conditions like osteoporosis, researchers have linked high dose calcium supplements with a  higher risk of cardiovascular disease . For this reason, most women should aim to increase their calcium intake by regularly eating  calcium-rich foods , like yogurt, kefir, beans, and greens.
Vitamin B12:  Older adults have a  decreased ability  to properly absorb B12 due to a condition called  atrophic gastritis . This condition involves inflammation of the stomach lining with low stomach acid excretion. Additionally, many women over the age of 50 are taking medications like acid-suppressing drugs, which can interfere with B12 absorption. Because of this, experts recommend that adults over the age of 51 years supplement their diet with B12.
Vitamin D:  Vitamin D deficiency is  common  in older adults due to factors like reduced vitamin D intake, less time spent outdoors, and decreased vitamin D synthesis in the skin. Vitamin D deficiency can negatively affect physical and mental health by increasing the risk of depression, osteoporosis, and several other conditions. The  current recommended daily allowance (RDA)  is 600 international units (IU) of vitamin D per day for adults ages 51 to 70 years and 800 IU for adults over 70 years. The best multivitamin for women over 70 contains larger amounts of vitamin D, since the body’s ability make vitamin D decreases with age. Many experts agree that most people require higher than the recommended doses of vitamin D to maintain optimal levels of this critical nutrient.
In addition to the nutrients listed above, several other vitamins and minerals, including zinc, manganese, and magnesium, are essential to health among older females.
Studies show  that systemic inflammation, which is more common in older people, can deplete levels of several micronutrients, including zinc and manganese. This may impair the body’s ability to fight off pathogens and maintain a strong immune response.
While other nutrients are important for aging women, choosing a multivitamin with the vitamins and minerals listed above can increase your chances of meeting most of your micronutrient needs.
Most women over 50 years old have stopped getting their periods, which  reduces the body’s need for iron  due to less blood loss. Because of this, most women over menopause don’t need to take supplemental iron, which is why supplements specifically designed for older women are usually iron-free.
However, talking with a doctor is important to determine your iron needs. Some women, such as those with iron deficiency anemia, may need additional iron.

Supplements for menopause
If you’re experiencing  menopause-related symptoms , like hot flashes or sleep disturbances, some supplements may help.
For example,  black cohosh , found in Garden of Life Organics Women’s 40+, has shown promise in  decreasing certain symptoms of menopause , including hot flashes, when taken as a supplement.
Evening primrose oil  is another example of a natural ingredient that may benefit women experiencing symptoms of menopause. Evening primrose supplements are effective for  reducing night sweats  in women going through menopause.
Other  herbs and compounds  that may improve menopause symptoms include  maca ,  wild yam , and pollen extract.
It’s important to note that you should not take supplements for menopause symptoms unless you clear it with a healthcare professional first. Many ingredients, like herbs, have the potential to interact with certain commonly prescribed medications and aren’t safe for everyone.
Also, if you’re experiencing significant menopause-related symptoms, it’s important to make an appointment with a healthcare professional. You should not use supplements as a replacement for medical care, and some women may require medical treatment, like hormone replacement therapy, to feel better.

When to talk with a doctor
Although many women can benefit from a multivitamin, some women over 50 may need a more specialized supplement regimen.
For example, if you have nutrient deficiencies, have an underlying health condition, or take one or more medications, it’s best to seek supplementation advice from a healthcare professional who understands your personal information.
It’s also important to get appropriate care from a doctor if you’re experiencing symptoms like:
very low energy
unintentional weight gain
unintentional weight loss
gastrointestinal symptoms, like bloating or abdominal pain
While supplements may help you feel better in some ways, they’re not a substitute for medical care and should never be used in place of medications.

While it’s possible to obtain essential nutrients through a balanced diet, multivitamins may be a useful supplement for women over 50 years old if they aren’t getting their nutrient needs through diet alone.
Additionally, aging often causes changes in nutrient absorption and metabolism, which could make it challenging to meet all nutritional needs solely from food.
That being said, individual nutritional requirements vary, so it’s advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before making your choice to determine if a multivitamin is right for you and to receive personalized recommendations based on your specific health needs.
