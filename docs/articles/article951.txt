Title: Is the Ketogenic Diet Effective for Women?

The keto diet has shown promise when used therapeutically to improve certain aspects of health in women, including body weight and blood sugar control. However, the keto diet isn’t appropriate for all women or people assigned female at birth.
Studies have shown that the keto diet can be used as a way to reduce body fat and improve blood sugar and even as a complementary treatment for certain cancers.
Although much of the research focuses on how well the keto diet works in men or people assigned male at birth, a decent number of studies have included women or focused exclusively on the effects of the keto diet on the female sex.

Keto and weight loss for women
Some research suggests  the keto diet  may be an effective way to encourage fat loss in the female population.
Studies  have shown  that following a keto diet  may aid weight loss  by increasing fat-burning and decreasing calorie intake and hunger-promoting hormones like insulin — all of which may help encourage fat loss.
For example,  one 2018 study  of 45 women with ovarian or endometrial cancer found that people who followed a ketogenic diet for 12 weeks had significantly less  total body fat  and lost 16% more  belly fat  than participants assigned to a low fat, high fiber diet.
A  separate 2018 study  of adults with obesity that included 12 women demonstrated that following a low calorie ketogenic diet for 14 weeks significantly reduced body fat, decreased food cravings, and improved  sexual function .
An  older review  of 13 randomized controlled trials — the gold standard in research — that included a population of 61% women found that participants who followed ketogenic diets lost 2 pounds (0.9 kg) more than those on  low fat diets  after 1–2 years.
Although research supports the use of this low carb way of eating to enhance fat loss in the short term, there’s a lack of studies exploring the long-term effects of the keto diet on weight loss.
Some evidence  suggests that the weight-loss-promoting benefits of the keto diet drop off around the 5-month mark, which may be due to its restrictive nature.
Moreover, some research shows that less restrictive  low carb diets  may have comparable effects and are easier to sustain long-term.
For example, a  2019 study  that included 52 women found that low and moderate-carb diets that contained 15% and 25% carbs, respectively, reduced body fat and  waist circumference  over 12 weeks, similar to a ketogenic diet that contained 5% carbs.

Keto and blood sugar control for women
People with high blood sugar, including those with  type 2 diabetes , may be attracted to the keto diet because it limits carb intake to less than 10% of total calories.
An older  4-month study  that included 58 women with  obesity  and type 2 diabetes found that a low calorie keto diet caused significantly greater weight loss and reductions in  fasting blood sugar  and  hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)  than a standard low calorie diet.
HbA1c is a marker of long-term blood sugar control.
A  2019 case study  of a 65-year-old woman with a 26-year history of type 2 diabetes and  depression  demonstrated that after following a ketogenic diet for 12 weeks, along with psychotherapy and high intensity exercise, her HbA1c dropped out of the diabetic range.
Her fasting blood sugar and her markers for clinical depression normalized. Essentially, this case study showed that the ketogenic diet put this woman’s type 2 diabetes into remission.
A  2017 study  of 25 people that included 15 women showed similar results. After 32 weeks of following a keto diet, approximately 55% of the study population had HbA1c levels below the diabetic level, compared with 0% who followed a  low fat diet .
It’s important to note that studies on the long-term adherence, safety, and efficacy of the ketogenic diet on blood sugar control are lacking.
Meanwhile, less restrictive diets, including  the Mediterranean diet , have been researched for decades and are  well known  for their safety and beneficial effects on blood sugar control and overall health.

Keto and cancer treatment for women
The ketogenic diet has been shown to be beneficial when used as a  complementary treatment  method for  certain types of cancer  alongside traditional medications.
One 2018 study  of 45 women with endometrial or ovarian cancer found that following a ketogenic diet increased blood levels of ketone bodies and lowered levels of  insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) , a hormone that may promote the spread of cancer cells.
The researchers acknowledged that this change, along with the decrease in blood sugar seen in those following ketogenic diets, creates an inhospitable environment for cancer cells that may suppress their growth and spread.
Research from 2018 also shows  that the ketogenic diet may improve physical function, increase energy levels, and decrease food cravings in people with endometrial and ovarian cancer.
The ketogenic diet has also  shown promise  when used as a treatment alongside standard treatments like chemotherapy for other cancers that affect women, including  glioblastoma multiforme , an aggressive cancer that affects the brain.
However, it’s important to note that because of the highly restrictive nature of the ketogenic diet and the current lack of high quality research, this diet isn’t recommended as a treatment for most cancers.

Potential risks associated with the keto diet
One of the largest concerns over following a high fat, low carb diet is its potential  negative effects  on heart health.
Interestingly, while some evidence shows that the ketogenic diet may increase certain heart disease risk factors, including  LDL (“bad”) cholesterol , other studies have found that the diet may benefit heart health.
A  small 2018 study  that included 3 female Crossfit athletes found that after 12 weeks of following a ketogenic diet, LDL cholesterol was increased by around 35% in the ketogenic diet, compared with the athletes who followed a control diet.
However, a  2020 study  of women with endometrial and ovarian cancer demonstrated that following a ketogenic diet for 12 weeks had no adverse effects on  blood lipids  when compared with a low fat, high fiber diet.
Likewise, other  studies have shown  conflicting results.
Some findings indicate that the ketogenic diet raises heart-protective  HDL cholesterol  and reduces total and LDL cholesterol, while others have found the ketogenic diet to raise LDL significantly.
It’s important to note that depending on the composition of the diet, ketogenic diets are likely to affect heart health risk factors differently.
For example, a ketogenic diet high in saturated fat is  more likely  to raise LDL cholesterol than a keto diet primarily composed of  unsaturated fats .
More research is needed to determine how this high fat diet may increase or decrease the risk of heart disease itself and to understand its effect on overall health better.

Keto may not be appropriate for some women
Due to its restrictive and hard-to-maintain  macronutrient ratio , the ketogenic diet isn’t appropriate for many people.
It  isn’t recommended  for people who are pregnant or nursing or who have certain underlying conditions. This includes:
liver  or  kidney  failure
alcohol  or  substance use  disorders
type 1 diabetes
pancreatitis
disorders  that affect  fat metabolism
certain nutritional deficiencies, including  carnitine deficiency
a blood disorder known as  porphyria
In addition to the contraindications listed above, there are other factors to consider when thinking about trying the ketogenic diet.
For example, the ketogenic diet can cause unpleasant symptoms known collectively as the  keto flu  during the adaptation phase of the diet.
Symptoms  include  irritability, nausea, constipation, fatigue, and muscle aches.
Although these symptoms typically subside after a week or so, these effects should still be considered when thinking about trying the keto diet.

Should you try the keto diet?
Before you start any significant dietary changes, it’s important to consider the positives and negatives of the diet, as well as its appropriateness based on your current health status.
For example, the ketogenic diet may be an appropriate choice for a woman who has obesity or diabetes or is unable to lose weight or manage blood sugar using other dietary modifications.
This diet may also be effective for women who have overweight or obesity with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).  Studies show  that the keto diet may help people with PCOS  lose weight , improve hormonal imbalance, and boost fertility.
The ketogenic diet is restrictive and lacks long-term, high quality studies backing its safety and efficacy. Less restrictive dietary patterns may be a healthier choice for most women.
Before trying out the keto diet, it’s a smart choice to explore other, less restrictive options to improve your health and reach your wellness goals.
Adopting a diet rich in whole,  nutritionally dense foods  that can be maintained for life is usually best.

The bottom line
The keto diet is highly restrictive, and its efficacy depends on maintaining  ketosis . It’s recommended that this diet only be followed while working with a qualified health professional.
Although some women may find success when following a ketogenic dietary pattern, choosing a less restrictive, nutritious diet that can be followed for life is likely more beneficial for the majority of women.
Consult a registered dietitian or healthcare professional if you’re interested in changing your diet or improving your overall health and wellness.
