Title: 9 Health and Nutrition Benefits of Pears

Pears are rich in nutrients and several beneficial plant compounds. They may also help promote weight loss and protect against certain chronic conditions.
Pears are sweet, bell-shaped fruits that have been enjoyed since ancient times. They can be eaten crisp or soft.
They’re not only delicious but also offer many health benefits backed by science.
Here are 9 impressive health benefits of pears.

1. Highly nutritious
Pears come in many different varieties. Bartlett, Bosc, and D’Anjou pears are among the most popular, but around 100 types are grown worldwide ( 1 ).
A medium-sized pear provides the following nutrients ( 2 ):
Calories:  101
Protein:  1 gram (g)
Carbs:  27 g
Fiber:  6 g
Vitamin C:  9% of the Daily Value (DV)
Vitamin K:  7% of DV
Potassium:  4% of the DV
Copper:  16% of DV
This same serving also provides small amounts of folate, provitamin A, and niacin.  Folate  and niacin are important for cellular function and energy production, while provitamin A supports skin health and wound healing ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
Pears are likewise a rich source of important minerals, such as copper and  potassium . Copper plays a role in immunity, cholesterol metabolism, and nerve function, whereas potassium aids muscle contractions and heart function ( 1 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ).
What’s more, these fruits are an excellent source of polyphenol  antioxidants , which protect against oxidative damage. Be sure to eat the whole pear, as the peel boasts up to six times more polyphenols than the flesh ( 9 ,  10 ).
Pears are especially rich in folate, vitamin C, copper, and potassium. They’re also a good source of polyphenol antioxidants.

2. May promote gut health
Pears are an excellent source of soluble and insoluble fiber, which are essential for  digestive health . These fibers help maintain bowel regularity by softening and bulking up stool ( 11 ,  12 ).
One medium-sized pear packs 6 g of fiber, or about 21% of your daily fiber needs ( 2 ).
Additionally, pears are rich in pectin, a type of soluble fiber that has been associated with several benefits, including  improved gut health  and immune function ( 13 ,  14 ).
Notably, pectin may also help relieve  constipation . In one older 4-week study, 80 adults with constipation received 24 g of pectin per day. They experienced constipation relief and increased levels of beneficial gut bacteria ( 15 ).
As pear skin contains a substantial amount of  fiber , it’s best to eat this fruit unpeeled ( 11 ).
Pears offer dietary fiber, including prebiotics, which promotes bowel regularity, constipation relief, and overall digestive health. To get the most fiber from your pear, eat it with the skin on.

3. Contain beneficial plant compounds
Pears offer many beneficial plant compounds that give these fruits their different hues.
For instance, anthocyanins lend a ruby-red hue to some pears. These compounds may improve  heart health  and protect against cancer ( 11 ,  16 ).
Though specific research on pear anthocyanins is needed, numerous population studies suggest that a high intake of anthocyanin-rich foods like berries is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease ( 17 ).
Pears with green skin feature  lutein and zeaxanthin , two compounds necessary to keep your vision sharp, especially as you get older ( 2 ,  18 ).
Again, many of these beneficial plant compounds are concentrated in the skin ( 11 ).
Pears harbor many beneficial plant compounds. Those in red pears may protect heart health, while those in green pears may promote eye health.

4. Have anti-inflammatory properties
Although inflammation is a normal immune response, chronic or long-term inflammation can harm your health. It’s linked to certain illnesses, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes ( 19 ).
Pears are a rich source of flavonoid antioxidants, which help  ease inflammation  and may decrease your risk of disease ( 11 ,  20 ).
Several large reviews tie high flavonoid intake to a reduced risk of diabetes and developing or dying from heart disease. This effect may be due to these compounds’ anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties ( 21 ,  22 ,  23 ).
What’s more, pears pack several vitamins and minerals, such as  copper  and vitamins C and K, which also combat inflammation ( 6 ,  24 ,  25 ).
Pears are a rich source of flavonoids, which are antioxidants that may help reduce inflammation and protect against certain diseases.

5. May offer anticancer effects
Pears contain various compounds that may exhibit anticancer properties. For example, their anthocyanin and chlorogenic acid contents have been shown to  protect against cancer  ( 11 ,  26 ,  27 ,  28 ).
A few studies indicate that diets rich in fruits, including pears, may protect against some cancers, including those of the lung and stomach ( 29 ,  30 ).
What’s more, some population studies suggest that flavonoid-rich fruits like pears may also safeguard against breast and ovarian cancers ( 31 ,  32 ).
While eating more fruit may reduce your cancer risk, more research is needed. Pears should not be considered a replacement for cancer treatment.
Pears contain many potent plant compounds that may have cancer-fighting properties. However, more research is needed.

6. Linked to a lower risk of diabetes
Pears — particularly red varieties — may help decrease  diabetes risk .
One large older study in over 200,000 people found that eating five or more weekly servings of anthocyanin-rich fruits like red pears was associated with a 23% lower risk of type 2 diabetes ( 34 ).
Additionally, a 2015 mouse study noted that plant compounds, including  anthocyanins , in pear peel exhibited both anti-diabetes and anti-inflammatory effects ( 35 ).
What’s more, the fiber in pears slows digestion, giving your body more time to break down and absorb carbs. This can also help regulate  blood sugar levels  ( 36 ).
Pears may help reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes due to their fiber and anthocyanin contents.

7. May boost heart health
Pears may help lower your risk of heart disease.
Their procyanidin antioxidants may decrease stiffness in heart tissue,  lower LDL (bad) cholesterol , and increase HDL (good) cholesterol ( 37 ,  38 ,  39 ).
The peel contains an important antioxidant called quercetin, which is thought to benefit heart health by decreasing inflammation and reducing heart disease risk factors like  high blood pressure  and cholesterol levels ( 11 ,  40 ).
One study in 40 adults with metabolic syndrome — a cluster of symptoms that increases your heart disease risk — found that eating 2 medium pears each day for 12 weeks lowered heart disease risk factors, such as high blood pressure and waist circumference ( 41 ).
Another 2015 study in over 30,000 women revealed that every daily 80-g portion of fruit decreased heart disease risk by 6%–7%. For context, a medium pear weighs around 178 g ( 2 ,  42 ).
Furthermore, regular intake of pears and other white-fleshed fruits is thought to lower stroke risk. An older 10-year study in over 20,000 people determined that every 25 g of white-fleshed fruit eaten daily decreased stroke risk by 9% ( 43 ).
Pears are rich in potent antioxidants, such as procyanidins and quercetin, that can boost heart health by improving blood pressure and cholesterol. Eating pears regularly may also reduce stroke risk.

8. May help you lose weight
Pears are low in calories,  high in water , and packed with fiber. This combination makes them a weight loss-friendly food, as fiber and water can help  keep you full  ( 44 ,  45 ).
When full, you’re naturally less prone to keep eating.
In one 12-week study, 40 adults who ate two pears daily lost up to 0.3 inches (0.7 centimeters) off their waist circumference ( 41 ).
Plus, a 2008 study found that women who added three pears per day to their usual diet for 10 weeks lost an average of 1.9 pounds (0.84 kilograms) ( 44 ).
Eating pears regularly may help you feel full because of their high amounts of water and fiber. In turn, this may help you lose weight.

9. Easy to add to your diet
Pears are available year-round and easy to find in most grocery stores.
Eaten whole — with a handful of  nuts  if you choose — they make a great snack. It’s also easy to add them to your favorite dishes, such as oatmeal, salads, and smoothies.
Popular cooking methods include roasting and poaching. Pears complement chicken or pork especially well. They likewise pair nicely with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg,  cheeses  like Gouda and brie, and ingredients like lemon and chocolate.
However you choose to eat them, remember to include the skin to get the most nutrients.
Pears are widely available and easy to add to your diet. You can eat them whole with the skin on or incorporate them into main dishes. These fruits are especially delicious when roasted or poached.

The bottom line
Pears are a powerhouse fruit, packing fiber, vitamins, and beneficial plant compounds.
These nutrients are thought to fight inflammation, promote gut and heart health, protect against certain diseases, and even aid  weight loss .
Just be sure to  eat the peel , as it harbors many of this fruit’s beneficial compounds.
