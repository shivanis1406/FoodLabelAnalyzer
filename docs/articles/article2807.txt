Title: 6 Healthy Heritage Food Picks from a Black Nutritionist

There’s been a lot of talk about cultural foods lately, but what does that really mean?
Cultural and heritage foods can refer to traditions based on region, ethnicity, and even particular families.
“Cultural foods are different based on the individual,” says Maya Feller, registered dietitian and author of  “Eating from Our Roots: 80+ Healthy Home-Cooked Favorites From Cultures Around The World.”
She notes that heritage foods may look similar based on geography. However, they may have differences based on preferences and history.
These include:
likes and dislikes
food availability
preparation techniques
family tradition
“I identify as a Black American woman,” says Feller. “However, if you ask about my ethnicity, I would say that I am of Afro-Carribean origin as a first-generation, third-culture person.”
Feller notes that flavors and foods from Trinidad, Tobago, and Haiti are very much a part of her culture, as are foods and flavors of the Northeast of the U.S., where she was born and currently lives.
Below are some of her favorite foods, plus health benefits and prep tips.

Hibiscus
Hibiscus is a flowering plant also known as roselle or sorrell. It contains a number of beneficial  nutrients  and  antioxidants .
These include:
calcium
magnesium
potassium
vitamin C
B vitamins
flavonoids
phenolic acids
organic acids
Hibiscus is commonly prepared as a tea. However, not all of these nutrients transfer into the tea.
“When I was a kid, I LOVED drinking sorrell,” says Feller. “In Trinidad, it’s made from dried hibiscus flowers, ginger, and a sweetener. My love for sorrell persists, and now I drink it without sweetener year-round.”
Pro tip:  Enjoy it iced or hot. Just be sure to steep for a long time so all of the flavors come out.

Tamarind
Tamarind  is a tropical fruit that grows in pods and is often made into candy.
It offers several beneficial nutrients, with  one cup  providing:
Magnesium: 26% of the daily value (DV)
Potassium: 16% of the DV
Iron: 19% of the DV
Calcium: 7% of the DV
Phosphorus: 11% of the DV
Copper: 11% of the DV
Vitamin B1 (thiamin): 43% of the DV
Vitamin B2 (riboflavin): 14% of the DV
Vitamin B3 (niacin): 15% of the DV
It also contains fiber, protein, and  antioxidants .
“As a child, my maternal grandmother would make tamarind and mango chutney that I put on everything,” Feller shares.
Tamarind has endless uses in cooking. Some of these include:
a paste or spread
tamarind balls
chutney
candy
sauces
a sweet and sour drink
According to Feller, it has a sweet, tangy flavor that pairs well with vegetables and animal proteins.

Garlic
Garlic  is a common—even essential—ingredient in many types of cuisine as well as potent  home remedy .
It also offers a host of benefits. For instance, garlic may  reduce the recovery time  of the common cold, though there’s limited clinical evidence. Garlic can also help  reduce blood pressure .
“When I was younger, my mother would make garlic, ginger, and honey tea when I wasn’t feeling well,” says Feller. “It was a potent elixir.”
In addition, garlic contains antioxidants that protect against  oxidative damage .

Ginger
Ginger is another powerful ingredient that plays an important role in cooking and wellness. It contains the bioactive compound gingerol, have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.
Ginger’s many benefits include:
improves  nausea
reduces  osteoarthritis (OA) pain
reduces  blood sugar
supports  weight loss
“The warm spice of ginger is something that I’ve enjoyed since I was a child,” says Feller.
She suggests roughly chopping and adding ginger to rice, hearty soups, or pelau, a one-pot Trinidadian pilaf-like dish of meat, rice, and peas.
It’s also delicious in curries, broths, stir-fry, and more.

Cumin, black pepper, & turmeric
Cumin, black pepper, and turmeric make a savory, spicy blend.
“I couldn’t choose just one and often cook with them together,” says Feller. “My love for these flavors originated in childhood, as they’re reminiscent of Trinidadian food.”
Black pepper and turmeric  together are known to  fight inflammation , aid digestion, and even potentially  treat and prevent cancer .
Cumin  is also known to support digestion, weight loss, and is a  rich source of iron .
Try spicing up some greens and grains with a bit of cumin, or mix all three to make a dry rub for tofu or animal protein.

Anything spicy
Technically a fruit, you might be surprised to learn that  chili peppers offer health benefits  too.
They  contain :
Vitamin C
Vitamin B6
Vitamin K1
Potassium
Copper
Vitamin A
“When I was a kid, I would eat green mango, salt, lime, and hot pepper together, something all of my aunties would chatter about,” says Feller. “No one understood my love of unbelievably hot foods, and it persists today.”
She’s been known to slice up a jalapeno and toss it into a salad or use  black urfa  chili on eggs.
Some of Feller’s other spicy favorites include:
scotch bonnet
habanero pepper
serrano pepper
any scorching hot pepper
