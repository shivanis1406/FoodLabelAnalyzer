A comparison of the best jump ropes

Frequently asked questions
The type of jump rope that works best for you will depend on your height and fitness level. You’ll also need to consider how you plan to use it and on which kind of surface. Doing a jump rope routine on concrete, for example, will require an ultra-durable model.
Beginners should start with a heavy rope that’s slightly longer. Lighter jump ropes are ideal for speed work, while you can use a weighted top to maximize muscle growth. If you have space limitations, consider a cordless model. Longer ropes are necessary for activities such as double Dutch.
You can  jump rope every day  as long as it’s at a moderate intensity and for a short period. Limit longer, high intensity jump rope workouts to three to five times per week to give yourself enough time to recover. On recovery days, you can still do light intensity exercise, which may include a short jump rope session.
The correct jump rope length depends on your height and skill level. Some jump ropes are adjustable, which allows you to find the best length as you progress.
To measure a jump rope, stand on the rope with one foot. For beginners, the jump rope handles should come up to your shoulders. If you are intermediate or advanced, select a jump rope with handles that come just under or up to your armpits.

The bottom line
Jumping rope is a popular workout to improve coordination,  burn calories , and build strength.
Many jump ropes are available, and they range in terms of price, length, weight, and additional features.
You can use this guide as a starting point and consider the factors outlined above to find a jump rope that works for you.
