Title: Blue Zone Diets: 5 Regional Diets That May Boost Your Life Span

“Blue Zone” is a term for regions of the world where people tend to live longer lives, often reaching up to age 90 and even age 100 and beyond ( 1 ).
Currently, there are five known Blue Zones. They are:
Okinawa, Japan
Icaria, Greece
Sardinia, Italy
Nicoya, Costa Rica
Loma Linda, California
Research shows that while aging is influenced by your genes and can vary from person to person, external factors can greatly affect how long you live. These may include diet, lifestyle, stress, and social environment ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
Though these Blue Zones are scattered all over the world, their diets and lifestyles share some similarities.
For example, people in these areas tend to exercise more and eat lots of vegetables, nuts, whole grains, and legumes.
This article reviews the diets of each Blue Zone region.

Okinawa diet
Okinawa is a region on a group of islands called the Ryukyu Islands in the south of Japan.
The  Okinawa diet  refers to the eating pattern its residents traditionally follow. Okinawans are among the world’s longest living people. The diet is low in calories yet dense in nutrients ( 1 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ).
It is primarily a plant-based diet that centers on the staple sweet potato, leafy greens, yellow root vegetables, soy, and low  glycemic index (GI)  grains — the ones that don’t spike your blood sugar levels ( 6 ).
By prioritizing these foods, the Okinawa diet is rich in vitamins and minerals. It’s also packed with antioxidants, which help fight free radicals and reduce the risk of age-related chronic diseases ( 6 ).
While the Okinawa diet is not strictly vegetarian, people consume animal-based foods sparingly. The same is true of processed foods and sweets.
Here’s a list of staple foods to eat and foods to avoid when following a traditional Okinawan diet ( 6 ).
Vegetables:  Okinawan sweet potato, bitter melon, bamboo shoots, cabbage, white radish, Chinese okra, pumpkin, carrots, and burdock
Legumes:  primarily soy and soy products, such as tofu, miso, and  natto
Grains:  millet, noodles, and rice
Meats and poultry:  lean cuts of pork, chicken, and occasionally goat
Fish and sea vegetables:  fish, algae, kelp, and other seaweed
Condiments:  turmeric and various herbs and spices instead of salt
Dairy:  milk, yogurt, cheese, and butter
Meats and poultry:  beef, processed or cured meats, and eggs
Other:  cooking oils, fruits, sweets, nuts, and seeds

The Okinawa diet is primarily plant based. It’s low in calories but rich in nutrients. Its staple food is the Okinawan sweet potato, along with soy products and low GI grains.

Sardinia diet
The island of Sardinia is located west of the Italian Peninsula in the Mediterranean Sea. It is said to be the home of the longest-lived men ( 1 ).
The Sardinia diet is a variation of the  Mediterranean diet  — also called Sardo-Mediterranean — that’s associated with preventing chronic age-related diseases ( 9 ,  10 ).
The Mediterranean diet is characterized by a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, minimally processed whole grains and legumes, nuts and olive oil as main fat sources, moderate fish consumption, and low intakes of dairy, alcohol, and red meat ( 9 ).
In contrast, the Sardinian variation includes higher intakes of olive oil, fish, milk and dairy products, and alcoholic drinks ( 11 ,  12 ).
Some of the foods people eat and avoid on the Sardinian diet include ( 11 ,  12 ):
Vegetables:  tomatoes, potatoes, sweet potatoes, onions, cabbage, zucchini, and carrots
Fruits:  oranges, apples, bananas, dates, figs, and peaches
Legumes:  fava beans, lentils, and chickpeas
Grains:  barley and wheat for their traditional flatbread and pasta
Dairy:  goat’s and sheep’s milk, yogurt, and cheese
Fish and seafood:  sea bass, anchovies, octopus, mussels, clams, and lobster
Fats:  olive oil and nuts, such as almonds and hazelnuts
Herbs and spices:  parsley, fennel, mint, bay leaves, celery, and garlic
Alcohol:  Cannonau  red wine  and myrtle liqueur
Certain meats:  beef, lamb, and pork
Sweets:  honey, puff pastry, and candied orange peels
Some meats and poultry:  including processed or cured meats
Processed foods:  sugar-sweetened beverages, refined grains and oils, and ready-to-eat foods and snacks
If you want to give a traditional Sardinian recipe a try, you could make a homemade version of the  minestrone .
The Sardinia diet follows most of the Mediterranean diet’s eating pattern, with higher intakes of milk and dairy products, olive oil, fish, and alcohol.

Ikaria diet
Ikaria is a small Greek island located in the Aegean Sea.
The Ikaria diet is also a variation of the Mediterranean diet, with a higher intake of  coffee , potatoes, and full-fat dairy products ( 13 ,  14 ).
However, it still emphasizes fruits, vegetables, olive oil, cereals, and legumes, while keeping a low consumption of meat products and moderate intakes of wine ( 14 ).
Foods to eat and avoid in the Ikaria diet include ( 14 ):
Vegetables:  tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, broccoli, spinach, kale, and wild greens
Fruits:  apricot, figs, plums, pomegranate, berries, kiwi, oranges, lemon, and watermelon
Legumes:  beans, chickpeas, and lentils
Grains:  whole grain cereals and bread
Dairy:  goat’s milk, yogurt, and cheese
Fish and seafood:   sardines , salmon, trout, and herring
Fats:  olive oil and nuts, including almonds and walnuts
Herbs and spices:  mint, rosemary, sage, mugwort, garlic, thyme, basil, and oregano
Beverages:  boiled Greek coffee and red wine
Sweets:  honey
Some types of meat:  beef, chicken, goat, and pork
Processed or cured meat:  such as ham or sausages
Processed foods:  soda, candy, instant foods, and snack bars

The Ikaria diet is another variation of the Mediterranean diet with a higher intake of coffee, potatoes, and full-fat dairy products.

Nicoya diet
Nicoya is located in the Guanacaste province of Costa Rica. This specific region has a 20% lower mortality rate than the rest of the country ( 11 ,  15 ).
Compared with the diets mentioned above, the Nicoya diet has a higher animal-based protein content and a lower intake of healthy fats.
However, it is also characterized by high intakes of  fiber  and low GI foods — which also means a lower intake of processed and refined foods ( 15 ).
The Nicoya diet is abundant in plain, traditional foods, such as rice, beans, corn, chicken, and eggs. People also consume more expensive foods, such as aged cheese and olive oil, but more rarely ( 15 ).
Here are some of the foods Nicoyans eat most and least ( 11 ,  15 ):
Vegetables:   plantain , yucca, squash, pejibaye, bell peppers, onions, cabbage, tomatoes, and cucumbers
Fruits:  tropical fruits, such as papaya, banana, mango, and pineapple
Legumes:  black beans and lentils
Grains:  rice, corn, and whole grain bread
Dairy:  soft and hard cheeses
Poultry:  chicken and eggs
Fats:  butter, avocado, canola, and sunflower oil
Beverages:  fresh fruit juice, coffee, and guaro — a traditional alcoholic beverage
Some fresh meats:  beef and pork
Sweets:  pastries, table sugar, cookies, and desserts
Processed and cured meats
Dairy:  cow’s milk
Processed foods:  refined grains, sodas, and frozen foods
If you’d like to taste a traditional Nicoyan dish, try this  gallo pinto  recipe — a mix of white rice and black beans eaten as a breakfast staple, often with eggs on the side.
The Nicoya diet differs from the rest of the Blue Zone diets in that it has a higher intake of animal-based proteins and a lower intake of healthy fats. Still, it is high in fiber and low GI foods.

Seventh-day Adventist diet
The  Seventh-day Adventist Diet  refers to the eating pattern of the Adventist religious community located in Loma Linda, California.
People in this community follow a mostly  vegan  diet derived from the Bible. It’s based on nuts, legumes, and leafy greens. The Seventh-day Adventist diet is the only Blue Zone diet that is largely plant based ( 1 ).
Research suggests that vegan diets may lower the risk of chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. This may be one key to the community’s increased longevity ( 16 ,  17 ,  18 ).
Despite being mostly vegan, this diet divides meats into “clean” and “unclean” categories, according to the Bible. Adventists may choose to eat some of the “clean” options ( 19 ).
Here’s a list of foods to eat and avoid while following the Seventh-day Adventist diet ( 19 ,  20 ):
Vegetables:  tomatoes, leafy greens, broccoli, parsnips, carrots, and onions
Fruits:  apples, pears, bananas, peaches, oranges, and mango
Legumes:  beans and lentils
Grains:  oats, whole grain bread, quinoa, corn, rice, and  amaranth
Plant-based protein:  soy and soy products, like tofu, tempeh, and edamame
Fats:  olive oil and nuts, such as cashews and almonds
Some meats:  salmon, chicken, eggs, and beef
Dairy:  low fat milk and milk products
Certain meats:  including pork and shellfish
Dairy:  full-fat milk products
Beverages:  alcoholic and caffeinated beverages
Certain flavorings:  hot condiments and spices
Processed foods:  sweets and other highly refined foods, such as frozen, prepackaged, and fast foods

The Seventh-day Adventist diet is a mostly vegan diet inspired by the Bible. It divides meats into “clean” and “unclean” categories, and Adventists may choose among the options in the “clean” list.

The bottom line
Blue Zones are regions of the world where a higher proportion of people live more than 100 years.
There are currently five known Blue Zones. Their inhabitants’ longevity is partly attributed to their diets, along with other factors, such as exercise and social environment.
While most Blue Zone diets are primarily plant-based, one (the Nicoya diet) relies on animal-based foods as the main protein source.
Still, they all share other characteristics, such as high intakes of fruits, vegetables, and low GI foods.
