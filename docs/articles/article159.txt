Title: 15 Healthy Foods High in B Vitamins

Many foods are high in B vitamins, including certain types of meat, fish, and poultry, legumes, seeds, eggs, dairy products, and leafy greens.
There are eight B vitamins — collectively called B complex vitamins.
These include:
thiamine (B1)
riboflavin (B2)
niacin (B3)
pantothenic acid (B5)
pyridoxine (B6)
biotin (B7)
folate (B9)
cobalamin (B12)
Though each of these vitamins has unique functions, they generally help your body produce energy and make important molecules in your cells ( 1 ).
Aside from B12, your body cannot store these vitamins for long periods, so you have to replenish them regularly through food ( 1 ).
Many foods provide B vitamins, but to be considered high in a vitamin, a food must contain at least 20% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) per serving. Alternatively, a food that contains 10%–19% of the RDI is considered a good source ( 2 ).
Here are 15 healthy foods high in one or more B vitamins.

1. Salmon
This all-around nutritious fish is high in several B vitamins. In fact, a 3.5-ounce (oz), or 100-gram (g), cooked serving of  salmon  contains ( 3 ):
Thiamine (B1):  23% of the Daily Value (DV)
Riboflavin (B2):  37% of the DV
Niacin (B3):  63% of the DV
Pantothenic acid (B5):  38% of the DV
Pyridoxine (B6):  56% of the DV
Cobalamin (B12):  127% of the DV
Additionally, salmon is a  low mercury fish  that is high in beneficial omega-3 fats, as well as protein and selenium ( 4 ).
Salmon is high in riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12, as well as a good source of thiamine and pantothenic acid. Additionally, it’s low in mercury and high in omega-3 fats and protein.

2. Leafy greens
Several  leafy greens  stand out for their folate (B9) content. These are among the highest vegetable sources of folate ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ):
Spinach, raw:  12% of the DV in 1 cup (25 g)
Spinach, cooked:  39% of the DV in a 1/2 cup (90 g)
Collard greens, cooked:  17% of the DV in 1/2 cup (65 g)
Turnip greens, cooked:  21 % of the DV in 1/2 cup (73 g)
Romaine lettuce, raw:  3% of the DV in 1 cup (35 g)
Notably, some folate is destroyed by heat during cooking, and some can transfer to the cooking water as well. To minimize folate loss during  cooking , steam the greens until partway between tender and crisp ( 10 ,  11 ).
Leafy greens, especially spinach, collards, turnip greens, and romaine lettuce, are among the best vegetable sources of folate. Enjoy them raw or steam them briefly to retain the most folate.

3. Liver and other organ meats
Though not especially popular, organ meats — especially  liver  — are packed with B vitamins. This is true whether they’re from beef, pork, lamb, or chicken ( 12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ).
For example, a 3.5-oz (100-g) serving of beef liver contains ( 12 ):
Thiamine (B1):  15% of the DV
Riboflavin (B2):  263% of the DV
Niacin (B3):  109% of the DV
Pantothenic acid (B5):  139% of the DV
Pyridoxine (B6):  61% of the DV
Biotin (B7):  139% of the DV
Folate (B9):  63% of the DV
Cobalamin (B12):  2,917% of the DV
If you’re unaccustomed to liver’s strong flavor or view  organ meats  as unappetizing, try them ground and mixed with traditional cuts of ground meat. You can also try adding them to highly seasoned foods, such as chili.
Organ meats — particularly liver — are high in most B vitamins. To make liver more palatable, grind it with common cuts of meat or use it in highly seasoned food.

4. Eggs
One large egg contains 35% of the DV for  biotin  distributed between the yolk and white. In fact, eggs are one of the top sources of biotin — only liver contains more ( 16 ,  17 ).
Eggs also contain smaller amounts of other B vitamins. One large (50-g) cooked egg contains ( 17 ):
Riboflavin (B2):  20% of the DV
Pantothenic acid (B5):  14% of the DV
Biotin (B7):  35% of the DV
Folate (B9):  6% of the DV
Cobalamin (B12):  23% of the DV
Bear in mind that raw egg whites contain avidin, a protein that binds with biotin and prevents its absorption in your gut if you regularly eat a lot of raw egg whites. Cooking  eggs  inactivates avidin and reduces food safety risks ( 16 ).
If you don’t eat eggs, meat, or other animals products, you can meet your biotin needs by consuming foods like vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, and  whole grains , which all contain small amounts of biotin ( 16 ).
Eggs are a top source of biotin, second only to liver. They supply 35% of the DV for biotin per whole, cooked egg.

5. Milk
Each cup, or 240 milliliters (mL), of milk provides 26% of the DV for riboflavin, as well as smaller amounts of other B vitamins, including ( 18 ):
Thiamine (B1):  9% of the DV
Riboflavin (B2):  32% of the DV
Pantothenic acid (B5):  18% of the DV
Cobalamin (B12):  46% of the DV
Unsurprisingly, studies indicate that  milk  and other dairy products are generally people’s top source of riboflavin, followed by meat and grains ( 19 ,  20 ).
For example, in an older observational study in more than 36,000 adults in Europe, dairy products supplied 22%–52% of the riboflavin in people’s diets ( 20 ).
Like other animal products, milk also is a good source of B12, supplying 46% of the DV per 1-cup (240-mL) serving ( 18 ).
What’s more, vitamin B12 is well-absorbed from milk and other  dairy products , with an absorption rate of 65% ( 21 ).
Milk and other dairy products pack about one-third of your daily riboflavin requirement in just 1 cup (240 mL). Milk is also a good source of well-absorbed B12.

6. Beef
Beef can make a big contribution to your B vitamin intake.
In an observational study of eating habits in about 2,000 people in Spain,  meat and meat products  were the main sources of thiamine, niacin, and pyridoxine ( 19 ).
Here’s the amount of B vitamins in a 3.5-oz (100-g) cut of sirloin steak, which is about half the size of the smallest steak typically served in restaurants ( 22 ):
Thiamine (B1):  7% of the DV
Riboflavin (B2):  11% of the DV
Niacin (B3):  49% of the DV
Pantothenic acid (B5):  12% of the DV
Pyridoxine (B6):  36% of the DV
Cobalamin (B12):  72% of the DV
Beef boasts high amounts of B3, B6, and B12. A 3.5-oz (100-g) serving supplies about one-third of the DV for each of these vitamins, in addition to smaller amounts of other B vitamins

7. Oysters, clams, and mussels
Oysters, clams and mussels are a stellar source of B12 and an excellent source of riboflavin. They also supply smaller amounts of  thiamine , niacin, and folate.
A 3.5-oz (100-g) cooked serving of each provides ( 23 ,  24 ,  25 ):
These shellfish are also high in protein and several minerals, including iron, zinc,  selenium , and manganese. They’re a good source of  omega-3 fats  as well ( 23 ,  24 ,  25 ).
Oysters, clams, and mussels are a great source of vitamin B12. They’re also high in riboflavin and provide smaller amounts of thiamine, niacin, and folate.

8. Legumes
Legumes are most notable for their high folate content. They also provide small amounts of other B vitamins, including thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, and B6.
Here is the folate content of a 1/2-cup cooked serving of some commonly eaten  legumes  ( 26 ,  27 ,  28 ,  29 ,  30 ,  31 ,  32 ,  33 ):
Black beans:  32% of the DV
Chickpeas (garbanzo beans):  35% of the DV
Edamame (green soybeans):  60% of the DV
Green peas:  12% of the DV
Kidney beans:  29% of the DV
Lentils:  45% of the DV
Pinto beans:  37% of the DV
Roasted soy nuts:  24% of the DV
Folate  — or its synthetic form folic acid — is important for reducing the risk of certain birth defects. Note that the DV percentages above are based on an RDI of 400 micrograms (mcg), but  pregnant people  need 600 mcg daily ( 34 ).
Most legumes — such as pinto beans, black beans, and lentils — are high in folate, a B vitamin important for reducing the risk of certain birth defects.

9. Chicken and turkey
Chicken and turkey are most notable for their niacin and  pyridoxine  content. White meat — such as the breast — supplies more of these two vitamins than dark meat — such as the thigh — as shown in the table below.
A 3.5-oz (100-g) serving of cooked, skinless chicken or turkey provides ( 35 ,  36 ,  37 ,  38 ):
If you skip fatty poultry skin to cut calories, don’t worry — most of the B vitamins are in the meat rather than the skin ( 39 ,  40 ).
Chicken and turkey, especially the white meat portions, are high in B3 and B6. Poultry also supplies smaller amounts of riboflavin, pantothenic acid, and cobalamin. Most of the nutrients are in the meat, not the skin.

10. Yogurt
Yogurt is notable for its riboflavin and B12 content. Though nutrition varies by brand, a 2/3-cup (96–163 g) serving of  yogurt  averages ( 41 ,  42 ,  43 ,  44 ):
Keep in mind that when flavored, most frozen and refrigerated yogurts also contain 3–4 teaspoons (5 g) of  added sugars  per 2/3-cup (96–163 g) serving, so enjoy them in moderation ( 41 ,  42 ,  43 ,  44 ).
Stores also sell many  non-dairy yogurt alternatives , such as fermented soy, almond, or coconut yogurts. However, these products — unless fortified — generally aren’t good sources of riboflavin or B12 ( 45 ,  46 ).
Yogurt is naturally high in B2 and B12, but non-dairy yogurt alternatives aren’t good sources of these vitamins unless they’re fortified. Limit your intake of sugar-sweetened yogurt.

11. Nutritional and brewer’s yeast
Nutritional yeast and brewer’s yeast are inactive, meaning you can’t use them to make bread. Rather, people use them to boost the flavor and nutrient profile of dishes.
These yeasts naturally contain B vitamins and are often fortified with them as well — particularly  nutritional yeast . If nutrients are added, you’ll see them listed in the ingredients on the label.
Here’s how the two yeasts compare based on a 2-tablespoon (7.5 g or 24 g) serving, though these values vary by brand ( 47 ,  48 ):
People following a vegetarian or  vegan diet commonly use nutritional yeast , as it’s fortified with B12, which is challenging to obtain if you don’t eat animal products ( 49 ).
The nutty-cheesy flavor of nutritional yeast also makes it popular as a seasoning.  Brewer’s yeast , however, can taste bitter and may be better mixed into foods like smoothies, salad dressing, or soup.
Nutritional yeast and brewer’s yeast pack a high amount of B vitamins, but a significant portion of the vitamins in nutritional yeast (including B12) are added. These products can be used to add flavor or nutrients to other foods.

12. Pork
Like other common meats,  pork  is packed with several B vitamins. It’s especially notable for its high amount of thiamine, of which beef provides little.
A 3.5-oz (100-g) pork loin chop provides ( 50 ):
Thiamine (B1):  55% of the DV
Riboflavin (B2):  22% of the DV
Niacin (B3):  55% of the DV
Pantothenic acid (B5):  26% of the DV
Pyridoxine (B6):  35% of the DV
Cobalamin (B12):  31% of the DV
If you’re trying to lose weight, opt for loin cuts, which are lower in fat and calories than shoulder cuts (commonly used for pulled pork), spareribs, and  bacon  ( 51 ).
Pork is especially high in thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and B6. Pork loin cuts are much leaner and lower in calories than shoulder cuts, spareribs, and bacon.

13. Fortified cereal
Breakfast cereals often contain added vitamins, including B vitamins. Check for them in the ingredients list ( 52 ).
The B vitamins most commonly added to cereal are thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, B6, folate (as synthetic  folic acid ), and B12. Amounts found in a 1-cup (28–61 g) serving of a few popular brands — namely, Cheerios and Wheaties by General Mills and Raisin Bran by Kellogg’s — are ( 53 ,  54 ,  55 ):
Keep in mind that many fortified  breakfast cereals  are high in added sugars and refined grains. Select a product with less than 5 g of sugar per serving and a whole grain — such as whole wheat or whole  oats  — listed as the first ingredient.
Breakfast cereals often have added thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, folic acid, B6, and B12. Some contain up to 100% of the DV for these vitamins. Still, it’s important to choose cereals made with whole grains and minimal sugar.

14. Trout
Trout, a freshwater  fish , is closely related to salmon and high in several B vitamins.
A 3.5-oz (100-g) cooked serving of trout provides ( 56 ):
Thiamine (B1):  12% of the DV
Riboflavin (B2):  8% of the DV
Niacin (B3):  42% of the DV
Pantothenic acid (B5):  40% of the DV
Pyridoxine (B6):  23% of the DV
Cobalamin (B12):  171% of the DV
Additionally, trout is an excellent source of  protein , rich in omega-3 fats, and low in mercury ( 4 ,  56 ).
Trout is high in thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, and vitamin B12. It also contains ample protein and omega-3 fats.

15. Sunflower seeds
Sunflower seeds  are one of the best plant sources of pantothenic acid. This B vitamin gets its name from the Greek word “pantos,” meaning “everywhere,” because it’s found in most plant and animal foods, though usually only in small amounts ( 57 ).
Remarkably, 1 oz (28 g) of sunflower  seeds  packs 40% of the DV for pantothenic acid. Sunflower seeds are also a good source of niacin, folate, and B6 ( 58 ).
Sunflower seed butter, which is popular among people with nut allergies, provides some pantothenic acid as well ( 59 ).
Here’s a comparison of the B vitamin contents of 1 oz (28 g) of sunflower seeds and 2 tablespoons (32 g) of sunflower seed butter ( 58 ,  59 ):
Sunflower seeds and their butter are among the highest plant sources of pantothenic acid, a B vitamin found only in small amounts in most foods.

The bottom line
Consuming adequate amounts of the eight  B complex vitamins  puts you on the path to a nutritious diet.
Some top sources of B vitamins include meat (especially liver), seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, legumes, leafy greens, seeds, and fortified foods, such as breakfast cereal and nutritional yeast.
If you restrict your intake from some food groups due to allergies or diet, your chances of  B vitamin deficiencies  may increase.
If you wonder whether you’re getting enough B vitamins, try a free online program to track and analyze your food intake throughout the week. You can then adjust your eating habits to ensure you’re getting the vitamins you need.
