Title: The 7 Best Teas for Asthma Relief

Asthma is a chronic disorder that affects the lining of your airways, which become inflamed and narrow, resulting in symptoms like shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness ( 1 ).
Although there are many conventional treatments for asthma, some herbal teas may relieve symptoms.
Here are 7 teas that may provide asthma relief.

1. Ginger tea
Ginger tea is made by boiling the roots of the ginger plant ( Zingiber officinale ).
This powerful spice is loaded with nutrients and bioactive compounds. It’s associated with benefits like reduced inflammation, nausea relief, and lower blood sugar levels ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
Plus, research suggests that  ginger  may help relieve asthma symptoms.
Test-tube studies using human cells indicate that ginger compounds, such as gingerols and shogaols, may alleviate asthma symptoms by reducing airway inflammation ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ).
In a 2-month study, 92 people with asthma took either 450 mg of ginger extract or a placebo daily. Notably, 20% of those in the ginger group experienced wheezing relief, and 52% experienced chest tightness relief ( 9 ).

Alternatively, you can make ginger tea at home. Simply grate a small knob of peeled ginger, steep it in 1 cup (240 mL) of boiling water for 10–20 minutes depending on your desired strength, then strain out the ginger.
You can enjoy ginger tea as is or with a dash of lemon, honey, or cinnamon.
Ginger contains gingerols and shogaols, which are compounds that may provide temporary relief from asthma symptoms.

2. Green tea
Green tea is a popular beverage derived from the leaves of the  Camellia sinensis  plant.
It’s packed with nutrients, plant compounds, and antioxidants, which are tied to weight loss, as well as a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers ( 10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13 ).
In addition, research suggests that green tea may relieve asthma symptoms.
For starters, animal studies show that green tea antioxidants may help reduce inflammation in the lungs — a common feature of asthma ( 14 ,  15 ).
In addition, a study in over 1,000 people found that those who drank at least two 8-ounce (240-mL) cups of green tea had significantly better lung function than those who drank none ( 16 ).
Lastly,  green tea  is a source of caffeine, which may help relax your airways for up to 4 hours and provide temporary relief from asthma symptoms ( 17 ).
You can purchase green tea loose leaf or in tea bags.

Green tea is packed with antioxidants, which may help reduce asthma-related inflammation. It’s also a source of caffeine, which may temporarily relax your airways.

3. Black tea
Like green tea, black tea comes from the  Camellia sinensis  plant. However, it’s exposed to air for oxidation, which causes the leaves to turn dark brown, intensifying the flavor. It’s often blended with other ingredients to make teas like English breakfast or Earl Grey.
Similarly to green tea, black tea contains caffeine, which may help relax your airways and modestly improve lung function. This may provide temporary relief from asthma symptoms ( 17 ).
Its other potential benefits include a lower risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes ( 18 ,  19 ).

Black tea provides caffeine, a stimulant that may modestly improve lung function and provide temporary relief from asthma symptoms.

4. Eucalyptus tea
Eucalyptus tea is made from the leaves of the eucalyptus tree, which is packed with powerful antioxidants and plant compounds like eucalyptol.
Notably, eucalyptol may help treat asthma symptoms.
Research suggests that this compound may reduce inflammation, decrease mucus production, and expand your bronchioles — the passageways inside your lungs ( 20 ,  21 ).
In a 12-week study, 32 people with bronchial asthma were given either 600 mg of eucalyptol or a placebo daily. Those who received eucalyptol required 36% less medication to manage asthma symptoms, compared with those in the control group, who needed 7% less ( 22 ).

Alternatively, you can make your own at home using dried  eucalyptus leaves . Simply steep the dried leaves in 1 cup (240 mL) of boiling water for up to 10 minutes and use a strainer or cheesecloth to remove the leaves before drinking.
Eucalyptus tea contains eucalyptol, a compound that may help reduce certain asthma symptoms.

5. Licorice tea
Licorice tea is made from the root of the licorice plant ( Glycyrrhiza glabra ) and has a distinctly sweet but slightly bitter flavor.
In traditional medicine,  licorice root  has long been used to treat various conditions, including asthma.
Animal studies note that extract of the licorice compound glycyrrhizin relieves symptoms of asthma, especially when combined with conventional asthma treatments like salbutamol (albuterol) ( 23 ,  24 ,  25 ).
Although human research has shown similar results, more long-term research is needed ( 26 ).

Keep in mind that large amounts of licorice root may lead to dangerous side effects. It’s best to limit your tea intake to 1 cup (240 mL) per day and speak to your healthcare provider if you have any medical conditions.
Licorice tea is made from licorice root, the extract of which may relieve asthma symptoms — especially when combined with conventional treatments.

6. Mullein tea
Mullein tea  is a rich and aromatic infusion made from the leaves of the common mullein ( Verbasscum thapus ), which is native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.
It has been used in traditional medicine for thousands of years as a remedy for respiratory conditions, such as bronchitis, mucus buildup (catarrh), and asthma.
Animal and human studies suggest that mullein may help treat asthma symptoms like coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath by reducing inflammation, which helps relax the muscles in your respiratory tract. Still, more research is needed ( 27 ).
Mullein tea is available in prepackaged tea bags and or dried leaf form.
Shop for mullein tea online.
If you’d like to make mullein tea with dried leaves, simply add a small amount to 1 cup (240 mL) of boiling water and steep for 15–30 minutes. Use a strainer or cheesecloth to remove the leaves to avoid throat irritation.
Mullein may relieve asthma symptoms by relaxing muscles in your respiratory tract. Keep in mind that more human studies are needed.

7. Breathe Easy tea
Breathe Easy tea is a specific herbal formulation meant to improve respiratory health. It’s manufactured by the company Traditional Medicinals.
It contains various Western and traditional Chinese herbs, including:
fennel fruit
licorice root
eucalyptus leaves
Bi Yan Pian (a blend of 11 Chinese herbs)
a proprietary blend of  peppermint leaf  and ginger rhizome
Although no studies have examined this particular tea, it packs a variety of ingredients that may alleviate asthma symptoms ( 9 ,  22 ,  26 ).

Breathe Easy is a tea blend that combines fennel, eucalyptus, ginger, and other ingredients that have been linked to asthma relief.

The bottom line
Certain  herbal teas  may help relieve asthma symptoms.
Research suggests that ginger tea, green tea, black tea, eucalyptus tea, fennel tea, and licorice tea may  reduce inflammation , relax your respiratory muscles, and boost your breathing, among other benefits.
Keep in mind that these teas should be used in tandem with your current asthma medications and shouldn’t be seen as a replacement.
