Title: Is It Safe to Drink Egg Whites? All You Need to Know

Chicken eggs are one of the most nutritious and affordable foods on the market today.
Many diet trends embrace eggs, including keto, gluten-free, paleo, and Whole30. Eggs are one of my favorite breakfast foods because they always keep me full and satisfied — the best start to my day.
Eggs are made up of:
11% shell
33% yolk
56% white
The egg white consists mainly of water and protein ( 1 ).
Because egg whites are a trusted source of muscle-building protein, some people — especially athletes and bodybuilders — drink them. And many prefer to drink them raw.
People also use pasteurized raw eggs in several types of recipes, like hollandaise sauce and salad dressings.
But is it safe to drink raw egg whites? Keep reading to find out.

Liquid egg whites vs. raw egg whites
Liquid egg whites are usually stored in a carton and can be found in refrigerated sections of grocery stores. Before packaging, liquid  egg whites  are beaten and pasteurized to reduce bacterial exposure, so they are safe enough to eat.
Whole eggs  are available to purchase as well. You can get the egg whites from a whole egg by cracking it and separating the clear liquid goo (the white) from the golden yellow yolk.
Grocery stores also carry pasteurized eggs in the shell, though these products may be more challenging to find.
You should always purchase pasteurized eggs instead of regular eggs if you’re planning to eat them raw. Never eat raw egg whites unless you are certain they have been pasteurized ( 2 ).
Liquid egg whites are available at grocery stores and come in cartons. Raw egg whites come from whole eggs, which may or may not be pasteurized. Make sure these products are pasteurized by checking the labels.

Are raw egg whites safe to eat?
The role of the egg white is to provide nutrition to the chicken embryo and protect it from potentially harmful bacteria ( 3 ).
Salmonella  is a bacteria associated with raw eggs. Eggs can be exposed to  Salmonella  during the development of the egg or after the egg is laid. The bacteria can penetrate and invade the whole egg, and this germ can survive the antimicrobial benefits of egg whites ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
Eating raw or undercooked eggs that carry  Salmonella   can make you sick . Symptoms typically show up from 6 hours to 6 days after eating contaminated raw or undercooked eggs ( 6 ).
Children, older adults, and immunocompromised people are at the highest risk of illness from  Salmonella . Severe infections may lead to hospitalization ( 6 ).
Salmonella symptoms may include:
vomiting
fever
diarrhea
abdominal cramps
Raw eggs  aren’t considered safe to eat because they may carry  Salmonella . However, you may reduce your risk of getting sick from raw egg whites by choosing pasteurized eggs.
Raw egg whites may be contaminated with a bacteria called  Salmonella .  Salmonella  can cause mild to severe symptoms that may lead to hospitalization. To reduce exposure, eat fully cooked eggs. If you do eat raw egg whites, choose pasteurized ones.

Pasteurization and safety of eggs
According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), pasteurization occurs when eggs are exposed to rapid heat treatments and sustain high temperatures in a specific time frame ( 6 ,  7 ).
Always store your eggs in the refrigerator at 40°F (4°C) or lower to further reduce your risk ( 6 ,  7 ).
If you like to drink egg whites as part of a healthy, nutritious diet, it’s crucial to purchase liquid egg whites that have been pasteurized.
The process of pasteurization exposes eggs to heat for specified time periods. The safest egg whites to drink raw come from pasteurized products.

Egg white nutrition
One 1/2 cup (120 mL) serving of pasteurized liquid egg whites contains ( 8 ):
Calories:  54
Protein:  11 grams
Fat:  0 grams
Cholesterol:  0 grams
Potassium:  152 mg
Sodium:  163 mg

Health benefits of egg whites
Egg whites may provide numerous health benefits, from bone health to cholesterol control.
Liquid egg whites are loaded with 11 grams of  protein  in just a 1/2 cup (120 mL) serving. A research summary concluded that adequate amounts of protein are necessary for optimal bone health and growth ( 9 ).
Older adults with bone disease experienced less bone loss, fewer bone injuries, and  greater bone mineral density  when their protein intake was above the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of 0.36 grams per pound of body weight (0.8 grams per kg) ( 9 ).
Amino acids  are the basic parts that make up protein, which sustains life through many bodily functions. Egg proteins provide all of the essential amino acids that the body requires but cannot make on its own.
Though  plant-based protein  sources contain many nutrients, animal-based proteins like egg whites offer protein that’s more readily absorbed by the body ( 10 ).
This means that your body may be able to easily use protein from egg whites.
For those with food allergies to cow’s milk protein,  soy protein , or nut protein, egg whites make an excellent alternative protein source — without harmful allergic reactions.
Having an  alternative source of protein  can help you meet the RDA for better health.
If you have an allergy to eggs, avoid eating or drinking eggs.
If you’re looking for dietary fat in egg whites, you won’t find any. A 1/2 cup (120 mL) serving of egg whites is free of fat and cholesterol, which  promotes heart health .
A study in 88 adults with untreated  high cholesterol  tested the effects of 4 grams, 6 grams, and 8 grams of egg white protein on total cholesterol. After 8 weeks, total cholesterol levels decreased by 11 points in those given 8 grams of egg white proteins ( 11 ).
Cholesterol buildup may cause plaque buildup in the arteries, which may lead to heart disease. So, eating egg whites may help prevent plaque, according to one small study ( 12 ).
Keep in mind that more human research is needed.
Protein is the most common nutrient that most athletes seek out to help support healthy muscles.  Muscle growth , building, and breakdown are greatly supported by eating and exercise ( 13 ).
Many studies purport that animal-based protein does a better job at building muscle  compared with  plant-based proteins, although results are mixed ( 14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  19 ).
Egg whites are an excellent source of protein with  very little fat  and very few calories, making them a go-to food for people looking to gain muscle mass.
Riboflavin, also known as  vitamin B2 , is rich in egg whites ( 20 ).
In one older animal study, 42 mice with diabetes were administered 10–20 grams of riboflavin per kilogram of body weight. A control group was left untreated.
In the groups treated with riboflavin, the study found  lower fasting blood sugar levels , reduced inflammation, and significant reductions in oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is known to complicate diabetes management ( 21 ).
Since this was an animal study, though, more research in humans is needed.
Ovalbumin, ovomucoid, and ovotransferrin are the major proteins found in eggs. They also function as  antioxidants .
Natural processes that occur in the body produce free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Both free radicals and ROS cause  oxidative stress  when they reach unsafe levels — potentially leading to conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer ( 22 ).
Ovalbumin, ovomucoid, and ovotransferrin egg white proteins can work to reduce these free radicals and ROS and help prevent diseases. These proteins also provide many amino acids ( 23 ,  24 ).
Egg whites offer a robust list of benefits including helping maintain bone health, providing essential amino acids, enhancing heart health, supporting muscle growth, managing healthy blood sugars, and preventing diseases.

The bottom line
Egg whites are excellent sources of high quality protein that provide few calories and zero fat. They contain essential amino acids, B vitamins, and a variety of antioxidants that may play major roles in the prevention of diseases like cancer and diabetes.
Protein-rich foods like egg whites can help with muscle growth, which is why they are a popular food among fitness gurus and athletes.
Eating egg whites may have many nutritional benefits. However, they can be harmful if not consumed safely. Always purchase pasteurized egg products, whether they’re whole eggs or liquid egg whites.
Remember that eating raw eggs, including egg whites, increases your risk of foodborne illness from  Salmonella .
Try this today:  For a protein-boosted beverage, add 1/2 cup (120 mL) pasteurized liquid egg whites to your best smoothie or shake recipe. For maximum nutrition, add other nutrient-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, oats, or yogurt.
