Title: Is Celery Juice Healthy? All You Need to Know

Celery juice contains multiple nutrients that provide health benefits, including antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds.
Celery juice is rich in nutrients and drinking it may come with many health benefits.
Some people think that it can cure conditions like cancer, obesity, thyroid issues, and acne, although research is scarce.
As such, you may wonder which claims are dubious and which are backed by science.
This article tells you all you need to know about celery juice, including its nutrients, benefits, and downsides.

Health benefits of celery juice
Celery juice may provide several benefits when consumed as a part of a healthy diet.
Celery juice consists mostly of water and may help you stay hydrated.
Staying hydrated is vital for your body, but many people don’t get enough  water per day . Proper hydration helps manage blood pressure, body temperature, brain function, nutrient delivery, waste excretion, and kidney health ( 1 ).
Celery juice is a healthier option than  sugary beverages .
A single cup (240 mL) provides just 3 grams of naturally occurring sugar ( 2 ).
Meanwhile, sugar-sweetened beverages like soda, sport drinks, and energy drinks account for up to 37% of added sugar in the U.S. diet ( 3 ).
Choosing low sugar beverages like celery juice may cut down your overall sugar and calorie intake.
Celery juice is high in plant compounds called phytonutrients, which may reduce inflammation ( 4 ).
These compounds act as antioxidants and help reduce oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs when unstable molecules called free radicals accumulate in your body ( 4 ,  5 ).
Antioxidant-rich diets are linked to lower rates of chronic ailments, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. They may also  boost skin health  ( 6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ).

Can celery juice help the gut?
Celery juice may affect the gut in several ways.
Celery juice contains luteolin, a plant compound thought to reduce  inflammation  in your gut ( 10 ,  11 ).
Luteolin is also found in many fruits and vegetables like broccoli, peppers, and spinach ( 12 ).
One 12-week study in mice fed a high fat diet found that mice that received probiotic-fermented celery juice had a healthier variety of gut bacteria. However, fermented celery juice differs from freshly made juice, as it’s infused with gut-healthy bacteria ( 13 ).
Fermented or fresh, there’s not enough evidence on luteolin or other compounds found in celery juice to determine how they may affect the gut. Ultimately, research including humans is needed before making definitive conclusions.
It’s worth considering how the celery juice you drink is made. Usually, fiber is strained out of it. Because fiber is key to a healthy gut, strained juice is less beneficial to your digestive health ( 17 ).
So, to reap the most gut health benefits, it may be best to not strain your juice ( 17 ).

Celery juice nutrition
Because most of its plant fiber has been removed, celery juice packs more nutrients per serving than celery stalks.
Just 1 cup (240 mL) of celery juice provides ( 2 ):
Calories:  33
Protein:  2 grams
Carbs:  7 grams
Sugar:  3 grams
Calcium:  7% of the Daily Value (DV)
Magnesium:  6% of the DV
Phosphorus:  5% of the DV
Potassium:  13% of the DV
Sodium:  8% of the DV
Vitamin A:  6% of the DV
Vitamin C:  8% of the DV
Vitamin K:  58% of the DV
Folate:  21% of the DV
It also contains smaller amounts of many other nutrients, such as zinc, copper, other B vitamins, and numerous  antioxidants  ( 15 ).

Celery juice cleanses
Though celery juice cleanses are a popular health trend, you should be skeptical of their claims. They’re often overblown and not based on science.
Celery juice has soared in popularity. In part, this is due to Anthony William, a self-proclaimed health expert with no formal background in nutrition or medicine.
William claims that celery juice is a cure-all that heals chronic illnesses due to its content of so-called “undiscovered cluster salts” that kill off harmful bacteria in your gut.
However, no evidence supports the existence of these salts.
Moreover, there haven’t been any human trials investigating celery juice’s effects on health ( 16 ).
Finally, there is no evidence that celery juice detoxifies your body, as another popular claim states. Your body has its own natural detoxification system that includes the liver, kidneys, intestines, and lungs. You do not need to drink special beverages for detoxing ( 17 ,  18 ,  19 ,  20 ).
While some people may experience health benefits when following a celery juice “cleanse,” this is likely due to broader lifestyle changes like limiting processed foods, drinking more fluids throughout the day, or  exercising regularly .
To follow Anthony William’s celery juice diet, you’re meant to drink 16 ounces (475 mL) of celery juice each morning on an empty stomach. This amount is increased to 24–32 ounces (710–945 mL) if you have a chronic disease.
You then resume a healthy diet for the rest of the day, though specifics aren’t mentioned. Many people treat the diet as a 10-day cleanse, while others follow it for longer.
Unfortunately, cleanses and fad diets tend to promote excessive calorie restriction, which can lead to dangerous weight loss, nutrient deficiencies, and hunger ( 17 ,  21 ,  22 ).
Research also associates juice cleanses with disordered eating and a negative relationship with food ( 23 ).

Downsides
Though celery juice can be nutritious, it carries a handful of downsides to consider.
One cup (240 mL) of celery juice contains around 189 mg of sodium ( 2 ).
Most healthy adults should limit their  daily sodium intake  to no more than 2,300 mg. A glass or two of celery juice can contribute noticeably to this total, so it’s worth keeping in mind ( 24 ).
This holds especially true if you’re considering following the celery juice diet, which recommends a large amount of juice each day.
In particular, people on salt-restricted diets may wish to avoid, or at least limit, celery juice.
Most celery juice is strained to remove its fiber ( 25 ,  26 ).
Though straining may result in more vitamins per cup (240 mL), fiber is a healthy nutrient that helps keep you full. Without it, your body digests the juice quickly, which can make you feel hungry soon after drinking it ( 27 ).
Replacing a nutritious,  fiber-rich breakfast  with celery juice may leave you hungry and cause you to eat more calories later in the day.
Additionally, fiber is associated with many health benefits, such as weight maintenance, gut health, and reduced cholesterol and blood sugar levels ( 14 ).
If you want to bump up your fiber intake, you can also opt for fresh celery sticks.

Who should drink celery juice?
Celery juice can be a great, refreshing drink to enjoy in moderation as part of a healthy diet.
Feel free to enjoy it with a balanced meal or as part of a snack if you enjoy it. It’s best to drink it without straining to get more fiber.
However, based on the evidence, detox cleanses are not advisable. They may be linked to nutritional deficiencies and disordered eating ( 22 ,  23 ).
Plus, those with heart disease or  high blood pressure  should keep the juice’s sodium content in mind, especially if they have been advised to follow a low sodium diet ( 2 ,  24 ).
If you’re taking any medications, talk with your doctor before starting a celery juice cleanse.

How to make celery juice
If you want to add celery juice to your diet, it’s simple to make at home.
Using a juicer is the easiest way to make it. Simply wash 3–4 celery stalks and run them through the juicer. If preferred, enjoy with ice cubes.
If you don’t have a juicer, cut 3–4 washed celery stalks and blend them until smooth. Place a strainer or mesh cloth over a wide-rimmed jug, pour the liquid into the strainer, and press down to extract all the juice. You may also keep some fiber in the drink.
For a bit of zest and flavor, try adding green apples,  fresh ginger , cucumber, fresh mint, or lemon juice.
You can also buy celery juice from many grocery stores. Try to avoid those with added sugar or flavorings.
It’s best to drink this juice with a meal full of fiber, healthy fats, and protein to keep you feeling full and satisfied.

Frequently asked questions
Unfortunately, there is little to no solid evidence that drinking celery juice in itself has any direct impact on weight loss. However, if used as a low-calorie substitute for higher-calorie beverages,  celery juice  can be an effective part of your weight management journey.
The fiber in celery is great for digestion. However, celery juice removes all the fiber that celery provides, and has no particular effect on your bowels other than adding water to your system.
The main benefit of drinking celery juice is to hydrate your body, and there is little difference between drinking it on an empty or full stomach.

The bottom line
Celery juice is low in sugar and contains potassium and vitamins A, C, and K. This popular drink may reduce inflammation and boost hydration, among other benefits.
However, you shouldn’t use celery juice to detox your body, as cleanses put you at risk of dangerous calorie restriction and  nutrient deficiencies . Furthermore, claims that this juice heals certain diseases are unfounded and not backed by science.
If you’re interested in celery juice, be sure to drink it as part of a balanced diet. For extra health benefits, try drinking it without straining if first to reap the gut-friendly perks of fiber.
People with digestive issues like IBS, those who are pregnant, and individuals taking certain medications should consult with a healthcare professional before adding celery juice to their regular morning ritual.
Try this today:  If celery juice is something you’d like to try, make a cup for yourself at home using the recipe above. If you want to retain some fiber, you can add back in some of what you strain out. Garnish with a celery stick.
