Title: 10 Best Pre-Workout Supplements for Muscle Gain, According to Dietitians

Pre-workout supplements are a popular option for those looking to gain muscle.
Designed to be consumed 30–60 minutes before your workout,  pre-workout supplements  commonly contain stimulating ingredients, such as caffeine, that allow you to work out harder and longer ( 1 ).
In addition to providing a boost to your workout, some pre-workout supplements contain ingredients that may be effective for muscle gain ( 1 ).
Keep in mind that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates supplements differently than medications and that the long-term effects of pre-workout supplements remain unknown.
Keep reading for our list of the 10 best pre-workout supplements for muscle gain.

Legion Pulse is our top pick because it’s third-party tested and moderately priced and comes in 15 flavors, 4 of which are also available caffeine-free.
Each flavor contains  L-citrulline , which helps improve blood flow to the muscles, and beta-alanine, which helps the muscles work harder and longer ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
The caffeinated flavors contain 350 mg of caffeine, and all flavors contain  L-theanine , which may help improve alertness and cognitive performance when combined with caffeine ( 5 ).
Keep in mind that because the daily recommended limit for caffeine is 400 mg per day, this supplement isn’t a great option if you regularly consume caffeine from other sources.
Notably missing is creatine, which means this pre-workout is a great option if you prefer to avoid creatine or already take a separate creatine supplement.
Legion uses third-party testing by  Labdoor  to assure quality and purity.

Outlift by Nutrex Research includes an impressive list of ingredients, including the three  branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) : L-leucine, L-valine, and L-isoleucine.
While more research is needed, BCAAs may help promote muscle recovery and growth ( 7 ).
This pre-workout also features citrulline malate, beta-alanine, creatine, and caffeine, all of which may have benefits for athletic performance, according to research ( 2 ,  4 ,  8 ,  9 ).
However, keep in mind that 1 scoop of Outlift provides 350 mg of caffeine.
While up 400 mg of caffeine per day is considered safe, this product isn’t suitable for people who are  sensitive to caffeine  or regularly consume caffeinated beverages throughout the day.
Outlift is third-party tested by Informed Choice ( 10 ).

According to Dymatize, PreWO is designed to maximize energy, strength, and intensity in the gym.
While creatine is  considered safe  and unlikely to cause adverse effects at low doses, higher doses can sometimes cause stomach upset ( 12 ).
As Dymatize PreWO doesn’t contain creatine, it’s worth considering if you prefer to avoid creatine or are already taking a separate creatine supplement.
Each serving provides citrulline malate, beta-alanine, and 300 mg of caffeine, as well as the following ingredients:
Betaine (BetaPower):  Derived from beetroot, betaine may improve muscle strength and power, though more research is needed. BetaPower is a highly purified form of betaine ( 13 ).
Inositol-stabilized arginine silicate (Nitrosigine):  A patented compound composed of arginine and silicon, Nitrosigine may enhance energy and improve workout recovery ( 14 ,  15 ).
Theacrine (TeaCrine):  Similar in structure to caffeine, theacrine may work synergistically with caffeine to  enhance exercise performance . However, one small study found no benefit of theacrine for muscle strength or power ( 16 ,  17 ).
Dymatize products are manufactured in CGMP-certified facilities and third-party tested for banned substances by Informed Choice.

If you prefer to avoid caffeinated supplements, then The Genius Brand Genius Pre is worth considering.
The pre-workout is caffeine-free but still offers many of the performance and stimulant benefits, thanks to theobromine and a group of ingredients called nootropics ( 19 ).
Nootropics  are compounds or supplements that can boost mental performance. Caffeine is the most widely consumed nootropic. Here are some of the nootropics found in Genius Pre:
Alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine (A-GPC):  A-GPC may improve the mind-muscle connection and motivation, allowing for gains in muscle strength, though more research is needed ( 20 ,  21 ).
Alpha-hydroxyisocaproic acid (HICA):  HICA is thought to decrease muscle protein breakdown and increase muscle gain. However, recent research on this is lacking ( 22 ).
Ancient peat and apple fruit extract (ElevATP):  This patented ingredient could potentially boost energy levels, allowing for increased muscle strength and power ( 23 ).
Rhodiola rosea :  Also known as  golden root extract ,  Rhodiola rosea  may decrease fatigue with exercise ( 24 ).
This pre-workout also contains citrulline malate to help increase blood flow to the muscles, as well as AstraGin, a compound that is thought to boost energy levels, though this effect hasn’t been confirmed in humans  ( 4 ,  25 ).

SHIFTED Maximum is a newer pre-workout formula that’s quickly becoming a favorite among serious weightlifters and other athletes.
The powder is designed to provide optimal effective doses of its main active ingredients, including 5 grams of creatine monohydrate, 300 mg of caffeine, 2.5 mg of  beta-alanine , and 150 mg of L-theanine.
It also includes beetroot extract, as well as several nootropic ingredients, including Alpha-GPC, ElevATP, and  Rhodiola rosea . While more research is needed, these ingredients may have cognitive benefits and help improve athletic performance  ( 20 ,  21 ,  22 ,  23 ,  24 ,  27 ).
In a study of 14 exercise-trained adults, researchers found that consuming SHIFTED Pre-Workout 45 minutes before a workout significantly improved measures of attention, reaction time, vigor, and fatigue compared to a placebo ( 28 ).
It’s worth noting that SHIFTED Maximum Formula Pre-Workout contains two proprietary blend products, AstraGin and ElevATP. Because the specific amount of each ingredient used in these blends is not disclosed, some people may prefer to avoid this pre workout.
SHIFTED products are third-party tested by  Armada Nutrition .

Transparent Labs Stim-Free Pre-Workout supplement is a great option if you prefer a product that does not contain stimulants such as caffeine, yohimbine, or theobromine.
Instead, the product contains citrulline malate, beta-alanine, BCAAs, and betaine (BetaPure) to provide a boost to your workout.
Keep in mind that beta-alanine can cause a tingling sensation that some people may find uncomfortable, but it’s harmless ( 2 ).
The product also includes  black pepper extract , which may have anti-inflammatory properties, and huperzine A, a plant extract that may have cognitive benefits, though more research is needed ( 30 ,  31 ).
Stim-Free Pre-Workout is third-party tested by  Analytical Resource Laboratories  for quality assurance.

Do Vitamins PurePump is designed to boost the feeling of a “ pump ” in your muscles during a strength workout.
Specifically, the product contains L-citrulline, an amino acid that improves blood flow to muscles, which can lead to a pump. However, its effectiveness for muscle gain is mixed ( 3 ,  4 ).
It also contains L-arginine, another amino acid associated with pump, though studies suggest that L-arginine is unlikely to lead to a pump because it is broken down before it reaches the bloodstream ( 33 ,  34 ).
Additionally, this pre-workout includes alpha-lipoic acid, which may help improve  muscle recovery . It also contains 1 gram of creatine monohydrate, which is known to support muscle gain, though research suggests an effective dose of 3 grams per day  ( 8 ,  35 ).
Do Vitamins PurePump is third-party tested by Labdoor for purity and potency. It’s also  Labdoor Tested for Sport  and  BSCG Certified Drug Free , both of which ensure that a product is free of all substances banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency.

Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre-Workout is one of the more affordable products available, at just $0.94 per serving.
It contains an effective 3-gram dose of  creatine monohydrate , which may improve performance and muscle gain, as well as 175 mg of caffeine  ( 8 ,  9 ).
However, it does contain a proprietary blend, which some may prefer to avoid, as the brand does not disclose the specific amount of each ingredient used.
This proprietary blend, AstraGin, is thought to boost energy levels, but there are currently no human studies to support this effect ( 25 ).

NAKED Energy is a great option for someone looking for a pre-workout that is free from preservatives and  artificial additives .
The powder comes in an Unflavored version, or you can choose Citrus or Fruit Punch, both of which are sweetened with monk fruit and cane sugar.
The pre-workout is also vegan-friendly, certified gluten-free, and free of soy, wheat, and dairy.
As for active ingredients, the pre-workout includes beta-alanine and 200 mg of caffeine to help boost performance in the gym ( 2 ,  9 ).
It also includes creatine monohydrate. However, one serving contains just 1 gram of creatine, which may not be enough to provide muscle gain benefits ( 8 ).
It’s worth noting that NAKED also offers a stimulant-free version of its pre-workout formula.

Gainful Pre Workout is a personalized supplement that contains a blend of caffeine, L-theanine, L-citrulline, and beta-alanine. Because the product is personalized, the specific amounts of these ingredients, as well as the nutrition information, will vary.
This pre-workout also contains BCAAs, which are thought to help improve performance and recovery when taken as a supplement. However, the research on the effectiveness of BCAA supplements is mixed ( 7 ).
Unlike other products on our list,  Gainful  is a subscription-based service that includes access to a registered dietitian for expert guidance.
According to the company’s website, all ingredients are sourced from reputable manufacturers, with a certificate of analysis (COA) required for each ingredient. However, its final products are not third-party tested to confirm purity and potency.

A comparison of the best pre-workouts for muscle gain
Here’s a quick look at how our top picks compare:

How to choose a pre-workout supplement
Choosing a  high quality pre-workout supplement  that’s worth your money can be challenging.
Here are a few things to consider when shopping for a pre-workout supplement:
Third-party testing:  Ideally, choose products that are third-party tested by an organization like USP, Labdoor, Informed Choice, or NSF. Third-party testing ensures that the contents of the product match what’s on the label.
Safe for sport:  If you’re a competitive athlete, it’s best to select a product that’s certified safe for sport by a third-party lab such as NSF, Informed Choice, or Labdoor.
Research-backed ingredients:  While more research is needed when it comes to the effects of supplements on various aspects of sports performance, some ingredients have been studied more than others. Examples of ingredients to look for are caffeine, beta-alanine, L-theanine, L-citrulline, and creatine ( 2 ,  8 ,  9 ).
Propriety blends:  A proprietary blend is a specific mixture of ingredients. The concern with these is that you don’t know how much of each ingredient the product contains. If you’re sensitive to any ingredients in a propriety blend, it’s best to choose a different product.
Unwanted ingredients:  If you prefer to avoid certain ingredients, such as artificial flavors or sweeteners, it’s a good idea to look for a product that is unsweetened or contains a natural sweetener such as cane sugar or stevia.
Stimulants:  Consider whether you want a product containing stimulants, such as caffeine, or you prefer a stim-free powder. If you’re new to supplements with stimulants, it’s a good idea to start with a half serving to assess your tolerance before consuming the full dose.

Potential risks and side effects
Pre-workout supplements are generally considered safe for most healthy adults. However, these products are not completely  without risk  ( 1 ).
Some ingredients are not well tolerated by all individuals. For example,  caffeine  can affect sleep, stress levels, and even blood pressure in some people ( 9 ,  39 ).
Beta-alanine can also cause a harmless tingling sensation that some people dislike.
Because the FDA does not regulate dietary supplements in the same way as medications, it’s a good idea to choose products that are third-party tested to ensure that the product actually contains what it claims to on the label.
Finally, children and people who are pregnant or nursing should not use pre-workout supplements. Always consult a healthcare professional before taking any new supplements.

Frequently asked questions
Pre-workouts are designed to be taken before a workout and contain ingredients that may help boost exercise performance and promote muscle gain ( 1 ).
Pre-workouts are meant for healthy adults looking to boost their performance in the gym.
While pre-workouts may have benefits for exercise performance, they’re not a replacement for other lifestyle factors that can affect your workout, such as  fueling properly  before a workout, getting enough sleep, staying hydrated, and practicing proper form.
Pre-workouts should be paired with a structured training program designed by a certified fitness professional. After all, these supplements are only as effective as the workouts they’re meant to support.
Most pre-workouts are meant to be taken with water about 30–60 minutes  before your workout . The exact timing varies by product, so it’s best to follow the directions on the label.
If you’re new to using pre-workouts, it’s a good idea to start with a half serving to assess your tolerance before consuming a full dose. This is especially important for pre-workouts that contain stimulants.

The bottom line
Pre-workout supplements contain a variety of ingredients that may help you  gain muscle  by allowing you to work out harder and longer.
It’s important to choose a pre-workout supplement that’s third-party tested and contains effective ingredients.
As with any new supplement, it’s a good idea to get the OK from the healthcare professional before adding a pre-workout to your routine.
