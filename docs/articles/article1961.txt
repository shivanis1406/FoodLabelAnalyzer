Title: The 8 Best Magnesium Supplements for Sleep

Getting quality sleep is one of the best ways to maintain your health, but it also happens to be something many Americans have trouble with. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), roughly 70 million Americans have chronic sleep problems ( 1 ).
To boot, recent research suggests that lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic may have worsened sleep quality in many people who previously slept well ( 2 ).
Some studies found that women were more likely to be affected ( 3 ).
With concerns around new variants, stress may persist for many. And that may continue to  affect our sleep quality .
So, what can be done?
Your mind may jump right to Googling the best  melatonin supplements  when looking for a supplement to help with sleep. However, other vitamins and minerals, including magnesium, also play a role in helping you get those quality hours of sleep.

What is magnesium?
Magnesium is a mineral that plays a key role in nearly every aspect of your health. It affects more than 300 enzyme reactions that help regulate many of your body’s critical functions, including sleep ( 4 ).
In fact, magnesium supplements are sometimes used to treat sleep disorders, improve sleep quality, and reduce sleep latency, which is how long it takes you to fall asleep ( 5 ).
One 2020 study in young women found that adequate intake of several nutrients, including magnesium, is important for sleep quality. Other crucial nutrients are vitamin K, vitamin B2, potassium, iron, zinc, copper, and tryptophan ( 6 ).
There are many  different types of magnesium , and magnesium supplements can include a combination of types.

How we chose
With so many products on the market, it can be difficult to find the right fit for you. This article evaluates some of the top magnesium supplements that:
contain bioavailable forms of magnesium
have undergone third-party testing to evaluate the quality
set strict standards for purity, potency, and safety
are free of unnecessary additives like artificial sweeteners and fillers
We’ve also avoided magnesium supplements that contain magnesium oxide because it has been shown to have low bioavailability, meaning your body doesn’t actually absorb much of it. It can also act as a laxative — not exactly ideal to take before bedtime ( 7 ,  8 ).

Magnesium supplement dosage and safety
Although there’s limited research on the recommended dosage of magnesium for sleep, one study found that taking 500 mg daily improved symptoms of insomnia in older adults ( 14 ).
However, research in other populations, including children and people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, is limited. As such, it’s best to use it only as directed and consult a healthcare professional to determine the right dosage for you.
Finally, if you’re taking any medications or have any underlying health conditions, be sure to talk with your doctor before starting a supplement.

How to choose a magnesium supplement
There are several factors to consider when selecting a magnesium supplement:
Type of magnesium.  First, it’s important to consider the  type of magnesium . Certain types, such as magnesium citrate, are more readily absorbed by your body but may cause digestive side effects in some people ( 9 ).
Slow-release formulas.  If you find that the mineral causes digestive issues for you, you may want to consider choosing a slow-release tablet or opting for a gentler form like magnesium malate or orotate ( 15 ,  16 ,  17 ).
Fillers.  Be sure to check the ingredient label if you prefer to avoid products containing fillers, preservatives, or artificial ingredients.
Additional sleep-promoting ingredients.  Some products may contain additional beneficial ingredients to promote sleep, such as zinc, B vitamins, ashwagandha, melatonin, or valerian root extract.
Allergies.  If you have any dietary restrictions or food allergies, check the label and opt for products that are certified gluten-free, kosher, or vegan, as needed.
Certifications.  It’s also a good idea to look for products that have been certified by organizations like USP or NSF International and undergone third-party testing to ensure quality.

Other frequently asked questions about magnesium
According to the National Institutes of Health’s Office of Dietary Supplements, the dietary allowance for magnesium in adults over 18 years old starts at 400 mg for males and 310 mg for females but decreases to 350 mg if you’re pregnant or 310 mg if you’re breastfeeding ( 4 ).
Meanwhile, research has shown that daily consumption of upwards of 400–500 mg of magnesium through food and supplements combined (or just through food if you can) may be necessary to have an impact on sleep quality ( 14 ).
If you’re already consuming this much, you may not need a magnesium supplement and may want to talk with your doctor about other potential factors in poor sleep.
Symptoms of a deficiency include appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness.
These are all early signs, but a more severe magnesium deficiency can cause numbness, muscle contractions, muscle cramps, seizures, and more. It can also lead to low calcium and potassium levels.
You can take magnesium supplements at any time of day you prefer. It’s more important to ensure adequate daily intake than to take it at a certain time. Unlike melatonin for sleep, magnesium doesn’t come with a risk of feeling groggy if you take it in the morning.

Takeaway
Magnesium supplements are often used to  promote better sleep .
Many types are available, and they vary in dosage and form.
Be sure to check the ingredient label carefully and opt for products that have undergone third-party testing to ensure safety and quality.
