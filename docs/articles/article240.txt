Benefits of trail mix
Trail mix offers several potential benefits related to both its portability and nutritional content.

It’s an excellent choice if you’re traveling, hiking, or going on a road trip because it  provides good energy  and is compact and easy to enjoy.

Trail mix typically contains several high protein ingredients, such as nuts and seeds.
Protein  is an important nutrient essential for muscle growth, tissue repair, immune health, and more ( 1 ).
Eating more protein may also help  support weight loss  by reducing your appetite and enhancing feelings of fullness ( 2 ,  3 ).
The nuts and seeds found in trail mix are rich in  heart-healthy fats , including poly- and monounsaturated fatty acids ( 4 ).
Studies show that unsaturated fats could decrease high LDL (bad) cholesterol levels, a risk factor for heart disease ( 5 ).
Other research also suggests that swapping out refined carbs and saturated fats in your diet for foods high in unsaturated fatty acids may be linked to a lower risk of developing  coronary heart disease  ( 6 ).
Plus, many types of nuts and seeds are high in omega-3 fatty acids, which could help reduce inflammation and protect against various chronic health conditions ( 7 ).

Potential downsides
Not all types of trail mix are considered equal in terms of nutrition.
Some varieties are high in unhealthy ingredients like candy, chocolate, or cereal, increasing the calorie and sugar content of each serving.
Added  sugar consumption  may not only cause weight gain but also contribute to conditions like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and liver problems ( 8 ).
Certain types may also be  rich in sodium , especially if they contain high sodium seasonings or salted nuts and seeds.
Consuming high amounts of sodium could increase blood pressure levels in some people, especially those who are sensitive to the effects of salt ( 9 ).
Furthermore, many ingredients found in trail mix are calorie dense, including nuts, seeds, dried fruit, and chocolate.
Therefore, it’s important to keep your portion sizes in check to avoid overeating and prevent weight gain.
Some types of trail mix may be high in added sugar and sodium. Trail mix also contains many calorie-dense ingredients, so controlling your portion sizes is important.

How to choose healthy trail mix
Although trail mix can be a healthy and convenient addition to a balanced diet, the type of trail mix you select is important.
For starters, be sure to check the nutrition label carefully and steer clear of varieties high in added sugar or sodium.
Ideally, you should also look for products that contain nutrient-dense ingredients like  nuts , seeds, and dried fruits and limited amounts of candy or chocolate chips, if any.
Making your own trail mix at home can also allow you to control its contents and maximize its potential health benefits.
Healthy ingredients include almonds,  pumpkin seeds , cashews, sunflower seeds, dried fruit, popcorn, and dark chocolate.
You can also boost the flavor even further with spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper.
Regardless of whether you purchase or prepare your trail mix at home, it’s important to monitor your portion sizes to avoid overeating.
One piece of advice to monitor your portion size is to avoid eating straight from the package and sticking to around 1/4 cup (35 grams) at a time for an easy snack on the go.
Be sure to avoid trail mix varieties with high amounts of added sugar or sodium, and choose products with healthy, high quality ingredients. Finally, be sure to monitor your portion sizes.
