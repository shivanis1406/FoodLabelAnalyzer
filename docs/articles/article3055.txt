Title: Pineapple: 8 Impressive Health Benefits

Pineapple contains nutrients and beneficial compounds, such as vitamin C, manganese, and enzymes, to help aid digestion. Eating pineapple may help boost immunity, lower cancer risk, and improve recovery time after surgery.
Pineapple ( Ananas comosus ) is a tropical fruit. It contains nutrients, antioxidants, and other compounds, such as enzymes that can protect against inflammation and disease. It’s commonly eaten baked, grilled, or freshly cut.
Pineapple and its compounds are linked to several health benefits, including improvements in digestion, immunity, and recovery from surgery.
Here are eight health benefits of pineapple.

1. Highly nutritious
Pineapples are low in calories (kcal) but highly nutritious. Just 1 cup (165 grams) of pineapple chunks contains the  following nutrients :
Calories:  82.5 kcal
Fat:  0.198 grams (g)
Protein:  0.891 g
Carbs:  21.6 g
Fiber:  2.31 g
Vitamin C:  78.9 milligrams (mg), 88% of the Daily Value (DV)
Manganese:  1.53 mg or 109% of the DV (for women) and 2.3mg or 66% of the DV (for men)
Vitamin B6:  0.185 mg, 11% of the DV
Copper:  0.181 mg, 20% of the DV
Thiamine:  0.13 mg, 11% of the DV
Folate:  29.7 micrograms (mcg), 7% of the DV
Potassium:  180 mg, 4% of the DV
Magnesium:  19.8 mg, 5% of the DV
Niacin:  0.825 mg, 5% of the DV
Pantothenic acid:  0.351 mg, 7% of the DV
Riboflavin:  0.053 mg, 4% of the DV
Iron:  0.478 mg, 3% of the DV
Pineapples also contain trace amounts of phosphorus, zinc, calcium, and vitamins A and K.
This fruit is also particularly rich in  vitamin C  and  manganese . Vitamin C is essential for  immune health, iron absorption, and growth and development , while manganese  offers antioxidant properties  and aids in growth and metabolism.
Antioxidants help prevent oxidation in your body, which  may help ward off  inflammation that can lead to cancer and other chronic diseases.
Pineapples are especially rich in vitamin C, manganese, and numerous other vitamins and minerals.

2. Contains antioxidants
Pineapples are not only rich in nutrients, but they also contain  antioxidants  — molecules that help your body ward off oxidative stress.
Oxidative stress  is caused by an abundance of free radicals, unstable molecules that cause cell damage often linked to chronic inflammation, weakened immune health, heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers.
Pineapples are especially rich in antioxidants called  flavonoids  and phenolic compounds.  One study of rats  showed that pineapple’s antioxidants may have heart-protective effects, though human research is lacking.
Moreover, many of the antioxidants in pineapple are considered bound antioxidants, producing  longer-lasting effects .
Pineapples are a rich source of antioxidants that may reduce your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers.

3. May aid digestion
You’ll often find pineapple served alongside meats and poultry in countries such as Brazil.
This fruit contains a group of  digestive enzymes  called bromelain that  may ease the digestion of meat .
Bromelain breaks down protein molecules, meaning your small intestine can more easily absorb them.
This is especially helpful for people with  pancreatic insufficiency , a condition in which the pancreas cannot make enough digestive enzymes. Bromelain is also widely used as a commercial  meat tenderizer  because it breaks down tough meat proteins .
One  test-tube study  found that bromelain reduced inflammatory markers in digestive tissue, though further research is needed.
Pineapples are also a  good source of fiber , which aids digestive health.
Pineapples contain bromelain, a group of digestive enzymes that help break down protein and aid digestion.

4. May reduce your risk of cancer
Cancer is a chronic disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth. Its progression is commonly linked to  oxidative stress and chronic inflammation .
Several studies note that pineapple and its compounds, including bromelain,  may reduce cancer risk  by minimizing oxidative stress and reducing inflammation.
Some studies show that bromelain  may also help treat cancer  that has already developed.
For instance,  one test-tube study  found that bromelain suppressed the growth of breast cancer cells and stimulated cell death.
Overall, more human research is necessary.
Pineapple contains compounds such as bromelain that may have anticancer effects, although far more human studies are needed.

5. May boost immunity and suppress inflammation
Pineapples have been used in  traditional medicine  for centuries.
They contain various vitamins, minerals, and enzymes, such as bromelain, that  may collectively improve immunity  and reduce inflammation.
In a  9-day study  from 2014, 98 healthy children ate either no pineapple, roughly 1 cup (140 g) of pineapple, or roughly 2 cups (280 g) of pineapple daily.
Those who ate pineapple had a significantly lower risk of viral and bacterial infections. Also, the children who ate the most of this fruit had almost four times more disease-fighting white blood cells than the other groups.
However, further research is needed to support these findings.
Pineapples have anti-inflammatory properties that may help enhance your immune function.

6. May ease symptoms of arthritis
Arthritis  affects more than 54 million U.S. adults. Many  types of arthritis  exist, but most involve joint inflammation.
Bromelain’s anti-inflammatory properties  may provide pain relief  for those with inflammatory arthritis.  One study  found bromelain supplements to be as effective in easing osteoarthritis in the lower back as regular pain treatment .
In  another study  in people with osteoarthritis, a digestive enzyme supplement containing bromelain helped relieve pain as effectively as common arthritis medicines.
Still, more research is needed on this.
The anti-inflammatory properties of pineapple may relieve symptoms of arthritis, though more human studies are necessary.

7. May speed recovery after surgery or strenuous exercise
Eating pineapple may reduce the time it takes to  recover from surgery or exercise .
While this fruit helps replenish carb stores after  exercise , some of its benefits are also due to the  anti-inflammatory properties of bromelain .
Several studies have shown that bromelain may reduce the inflammation, swelling, bruising, and pain that often occur after surgery, including dental and skin procedures. It may likewise  reduce markers of inflammation .
It  may even reduce discomfort, pain, or swelling  after dental surgery.
Bromelain may also  speed muscle recovery  after strenuous exercise by reducing inflammation around the damaged muscle tissue.
Nonetheless, more research is needed on this.
Bromelain in pineapples may reduce inflammation, swelling, and discomfort after surgery. Its anti-inflammatory properties may also aid recovery after strenuous exercise.

8. Easy to add to your diet
Pineapples are sweet, convenient, and easy to add to your diet.
The fresh fruit is easy to find in many grocery stores and markets, even out of season. You can buy it canned, dehydrated, or frozen year-round.
You can enjoy pineapple alone, in smoothies, salads, or homemade pizzas. Here are a few fun recipe ideas that feature pineapple:
Breakfast:   smoothie  with pineapple, blueberry, and Greek yogurt
Salad:  tropical roast chicken, almonds, blueberries, and pineapple atop lettuce or other greens
Lunch:  homemade Hawaiian burgers (beef burgers with a pineapple ring)
Dinner:  pineapple fried rice and  seitan
Dessert:  homemade pineapple whip (frozen pineapple chunks blended with a splash of coconut milk and a dash of lemon juice)
Fresh, stir-fried, blended, or roasted, pineapple works well in numerous dishes. You can find it canned, fresh, dehydrated, or frozen in most stores year-round.

Are there any health risks to eating pineapple?
Pineapples are not a common allergen. Eating them is considered very low risk unless you have a  known pineapple allergy . In that case, you should avoid pineapple and its extracts.
However, even in people without an allergy or diabetes, eating too much pineapple — more than a few servings per day — may have unintended side effects.
For instance, bromelain  may affect blood clotting . So, people who take blood thinners should eat pineapple in modest amounts.
Those sensitive to bromelain may also experience tongue burning, itching, nausea, or diarrhea — though these downsides are anecdotal and haven’t been studied scientifically.
Some people say that eating a lot of unripe pineapple causes stomach upset, nausea, and diarrhea. Again, this hasn’t been studied, but it’s always best to select ripe pineapple. The flesh should be light to medium yellow.
Pineapple is widely considered safe, though a small percentage of people may have an allergy to it. People who have diabetes or take blood thinners should be mindful of portion sizes when eating pineapple.
