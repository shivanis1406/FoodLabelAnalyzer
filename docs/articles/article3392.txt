Title: What’s the Best Diet for Hypothyroidism?

If you have hypothyroidism, you may benefit from eliminating gluten, processed foods, and any foods that may trigger your immune system or cause inflammation.
Hypothyroidism is a health condition in which the body doesn’t make enough thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones help manage several bodily functions, including:
growth
cell repair
metabolism
Medication is the first line of treatment for hypothyroidism, but eating a balanced and nutritious may help reduce symptoms and support your overall health.
This article outlines a nutritious, well-balanced diet for hypothyroidism, including which foods to eat and avoid.

Can specific diets help people with hypothyroidism?
For people with hypothyroidism, including Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, dietary interventions may have specific benefits, including:
improving thyroid function
helping maintain a  moderate body weight
reducing  symptoms of hypothyroidism
reducing  nutrient deficiencies , which may worsen symptoms
Eating patterns that  may benefit  people with hypothyroidism can include:
Mediterranean diet , or similar eating plans rich in vegetables and fruits, which  may protect against  cellular damage
an anti-inflammatory diet
paleo diet
autoimmune elimination diets, under the supervision of a medical professional
A diet low in pro-inflammatory foods,  added sugar,  and ultra-processed foods can be helpful for many people with hypothyroidism. Eating foods rich in particular nutrients may also support thyroid health.

Which nutrients are important for those with hypothyroidism?
The nutrients that may benefit people with hypothyroidism can vary based on the type of hypothyroidism. Doctors may recommend addressing nutritional deficiencies with dietary changes or supplements.
Iodine  is an essential mineral that is needed to make thyroid hormones, and a deficiency can contribute to the development of some types of hypothyroidism. Iodine deficiency is the  most common  cause of hypothyroidism worldwide.
Though iodine deficiency is common in many parts of the world, it’s less common in developed countries. People at a higher risk of iodine deficiency in developed countries can include:
people who don’t use  iodized salt
pregnant people
people following  vegan diets  are more at risk of having low iodine levels.
However, excessive iodine intake  can also be  harmful, especially for people with  autoimmune hypothyroidism , including  Hashimoto thyroiditis . It’s best to talk with a healthcare professional about your iodine intake if you have a thyroid condition. They can test your iodine levels and help you manage your intake.
They may recommend you avoid foods that are high in iodine, such as:
seaweed
kelp or dulse
iodine-enriched salt
Selenium  is another mineral that supports thyroid hormone production. It  helps protect  the thyroid from damage caused by oxidative stress.
Research  has linked selenium deficiency and the development of autoimmune thyroid disease, including Hashimoto thyroiditis.
Adding  selenium-rich foods  to your diet can increase your selenium levels. Examples can include:
Brazil nuts
tuna
sardines
eggs
legumes
As more research on selenium and hypothyroidism is still needed, experts do not broadly recommend taking selenium supplements if you have hypothyroidism. A healthcare professional may recommend supplementation in people with a selenium deficiency who cannot get selenium through food sources.
Selenium supplements may be helpful for people with hypothyroidism who have a selenium deficiency.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has identified  400 mcg  of selenium as the daily upper limit for adults. A high intake of selenium over time can cause symptoms of:
hair and nail loss
diarrhea
nausea
skin rash
The NIH notes that consuming high amounts of selenium can lead to toxicity. Selenium toxicity can have serious, and sometimes fatal, effects like:
kidney failure
heart attack
breathing problems
The body also needs  zinc  for thyroid hormone production and thyroid function.
Not getting enough can negatively affect thyroid function and overall health. A zinc deficiency can  lead to  or worsen hypothyroidism.
A  2021 study  in which participants took supplements containing zinc, vitamin A, and selenium suggests that increasing these micronutrients may increase thyroid hormone production in people with hypothyroidism.
If you think you may have a zinc deficiency, consider talking with a healthcare professional. They can determine whether or not a zinc supplement may be appropriate for you.
Other nutrient deficiencies that may play a role in the development or worsening of hypothyroidism may include:
Vitamin D:  Vitamin D deficiency  is a risk factor  for autoimmune thyroid conditions, including hypothyroidism. Low levels can negatively affect thyroid function. Though you can get vitamin D from  sun exposure , it isn’t concentrated in many  foods , so people often take supplements.
Vitamin B12:  B12 deficiency is  common  among people with hypothyroidism. If your levels are low, a doctor may recommend eating  foods high in vitamin B  or taking a B12 or B-complex supplement .
Magnesium:  Low magnesium levels  may contribute to  thyroid dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  Magnesium-rich foods  or supplementation with magnesium may improve hypothyroid symptoms.
Iron:  Low iron levels  or iron deficiency anemia can impair thyroid function. Supplementation is often necessary to reach and maintain recommended iron levels.
Other nutrient deficiencies that may contribute to hypothyroidism may  include :
vitamin A
folate
calcium

Foods to limit if you have hypothyroidism
If you have hypothyroidism, avoiding or limiting certain foods may support your thyroid function and overall health.
Ultra-processed foods  may increase  inflammation and oxidative stress in the body.  Oxidative stress  refers to the excess of reactive compounds called free radicals in the body, which overwhelm the body’s antioxidant defenses and can lead to cellular damage.
Hashimoto thyroiditis  can increase markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. Eating ultra-processed foods can worsen these markers and may negatively affect thyroid function and overall health.
Ultra-processed foods  to avoid can include:
processed snack foods, like potato chips
soda and sweetened beverages
sweetened breakfast cereals
flavored granola bars with preservatives
Gluten  is a group of proteins found in:
wheat
barley
triticale
rye
If you have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an autoimmune reaction that damages the digestive tract and negatively affects your body’s ability to take in other nutrients. This can lead to nutrient deficiencies and inflammation that  can worsen  hypothyroidism.
If you have a sensitivity or intolerance to gluten, doctors typically recommend following a  gluten-free diet . However, talking with a doctor or dietitian before drastically changing your eating plan is best.
Goitrogens are substances in soy products and cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and Brussels sprouts. Some  research  suggests they may interfere with thyroid hormone production.
Most people, including those with hypothyroidism,  can enjoy  moderate amounts of goitrogenic foods without negatively affecting their thyroid health. Goitrogenic foods can include:
cabbage
Russian kale
bok choy
Brussels sprouts
soy
pearl millet
Cruciferous vegetables like  broccoli  are low in goitrogens, and cooking goitrogenic foods reduces goitrogenic activity, making them safer for people with hypothyroidism.
However, you may want to limit the regular consumption of large amounts of juice made with raw  cruciferous vegetables .
However, a  2024 review of research  suggests these foods may not have the negative effect on thyroid function indicated by previous research. It’s best to talk with a doctor before eliminating foods from your diet.

Foods to eat if you have hypothyroidism
Following a diet rich in nutritious foods can help improve overall health and reduce the risk of health conditions  linked with  hypothyroidism, such as:
heart disease
obesity
type 2 diabetes
A  diet high in fiber  can also help lower the risk of constipation, a common symptom of hypothyroidism.
If you have hypothyroidism, you can try incorporating the following nutritious foods into your diet:
Fruit:  berries, apples, peaches, pears, grapes, citrus fruits, pineapple, or bananas
Non-starchy vegetables:  greens, artichokes, zucchini, asparagus, carrots, peppers, spinach, or mushrooms
Starchy vegetables:  sweet potatoes, potatoes, peas, or butternut squash
Lean fish, eggs, meat, and poultry:  fish and shellfish, eggs, turkey, or chicken
Healthy fats:  olive oil, avocados, avocado oil, coconut oil, unsweetened coconut, or full fat yogurt
Whole grains:   brown rice , rolled oats, quinoa, or brown rice pasta
Seeds, nuts, and nut butters:  almonds, cashews, macadamia nuts, pumpkin seeds, or natural peanut butter
Beans and lentils:  chickpeas, kidney beans, or lentils
Dairy and nondairy substitutes:  coconut milk, cashew milk, coconut yogurt, almond milk, unsweetened yogurt, or cheese
Spices, herbs, and condiments : spices like paprika, saffron, or turmeric, fresh or dried herbs like basil or rosemary, and condiments like salsa or mustard.
Beverages:  water, unsweetened tea, coffee, or sparkling water
Some people with hypothyroidism may benefit from avoiding foods they are sensitive to, such as gluten or dairy.
If you can, work with a registered dietitian who can help identify which foods you may need to limit or avoid. They can also help you develop a balanced eating plan that doesn’t unnecessarily cut out nutrient-rich ingredients.

Diet and thyroid medication
Ensure you take your thyroid medication on an empty stomach to promote optimal absorption. This includes avoiding beverages, foods, and supplements that could interfere with medication absorption. Experts typically suggest:
taking thyroid medications like levothyroxine at least  30 to 60  minutes before breakfast or 3 to 4 hours after dinner
taking your medication on an empty stomach
waiting at least 30 minutes before consuming foods or beverages besides water, including caffeinated beverages, which  can affect  how your body absorbs the medication
avoiding taking thyroid medication within 4 hours of taking iron or  calcium supplements

Sample meal plan
Everyone with hypothyroidism has different health and dietary needs. Your  calorie  needs depend on several factors, including:
age
activity level
gender
height
whether you’re trying to lose or gain weight
This general meal plan can help you understand what eating nutrient-rich meals may look like when living with hypothyroidism.
