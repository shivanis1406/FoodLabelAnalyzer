Title: 11 Benefits of Fish Oil

Fish oil is an excellent source of omega-3s, which is good for the heart and the brain. However, getting your omega-3s from fish is healthier. If you don’t eat fish, fish oil supplements are a good alternative.
Fish oil is one of the most commonly consumed dietary supplements.
It’s rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are very important for your health.
If you don’t eat a lot of  oily fish , taking a  fish oil supplement  could help you get enough omega-3 fatty acids.
Here are 12 health benefits of fish oil.

Nutritional information
Fish oil is extracted from oily fish like herring, tuna, anchovies, and mackerel. It contains omega-3 fatty acids, which have many health benefits.
About  30%  of fish oil is omega-3s, along with vitamins A and D. Fish oil has better health benefits than plant-based sources of omega-3s.
The two main types of omega-3s in fish oil are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), while the type found in plant sources is mainly alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).
It’s important to get enough omega-3s because the Western diet  often replaces  them with other fats, leading to potential health issues.
If you aren’t able to eat enough fish, taking supplements can help.

What are the major benefits of fish oil?
Research  shows that people who eat a lot of fish have much lower rates of heart disease.
Multiple  risk factors for heart disease  appear to be reduced by consuming fish or fish oil. The  benefits of fish oil for heart health  include helping:
lower cholesterol
lower triglycerides
reduce blood pressure
prevent the formation of plaques that harden arteries
There’s  moderate evidence  that omega-3 may help reduce the severity of and mortality from heart disease.  More research is needed  to determine if omega-3 has any association with preventing stroke or reducing mortality from stroke.
If you measure the weight of the brain without any fluid, it will contain about  20%  polyunsaturated fatty acids, which include omega-3. Therefore, omega-3s are  essential  for typical  brain function .
In fact,  research  suggests that people with certain mental health conditions have lower omega-3 blood levels, and having more omega-3s may  help prevent  the onset or improve the symptoms of some mental health conditions like  depression.
Evidence  shows that people who don’t get enough omega-3s have a greater risk of eye diseases, with the  exception of dry eye disease.
Furthermore,  eye health  begins to decline in old age, which can lead to age-related  macular degeneration  (AMD). Eating fish is linked to a reduced risk of AMD, but the results from  fish oil supplements  are  less convincing .
Because fish oil has anti-inflammatory properties, it  may help  treat chronic inflammatory conditions. For example, increased weight or stress can sometimes contribute to higher levels of inflammation.
When it comes to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), however, the role of omega-3 still  isn’t fully determined.
That said, fish oil supplements  can help reduce  joint pain, stiffness, and medication needs in people with rheumatoid  arthritis , which causes pain in the joints.
Your skin is the largest organ in your body, and it  contains  a lot of omega-3 fatty acids.
Fish oil supplements  may be beneficia l in a number of skin disorders, including  psoriasis  and dermatitis.
Omega-3s are important for early growth, particularly during  the first trimester of pregnancy , as well as beyond.
Taking fish oil  supplements while pregnant  or nursing  may help improve  the child’s cognitive development, though more research is necessary to determine this definitively.
That said, taking fish oil supplements during  pregnancy  and nursing  may also improve  infant visual development and help reduce the risk of allergies.
Your  liver  processes most of the fat in your body and can play a role in weight gain.
Fish oil supplements can improve  liver function  and inflammation, which  may help reduce  symptoms of  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) , and the amount of fat in your liver.
A number of neurodevelopmental conditions in children, such as  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) , involve hyperactivity and inattention.
Fish oil supplements may improve perceived hyperactivity, inattention, impulsiveness, and aggression in children. This  may benefit  early life learning. But more research is needed.
People who eat more fish  tend to experience  a slower decline in brain function in old age.
According to a 2023 meta-analysis of 48 studies, omega-3 supplements may help reduce of  dementia  and age-related cognitive decline by as much as  20%.
Asthma, which can cause swelling in the lungs and shortness of breath, is becoming much more common.
Research  suggests that omega-3 may help with reducing asthma-related inflammation, the severity of symptoms, and even the need to use asthma medications. That said, more research is needed to confirm this effect.
Calcium and  vitamin D  are very important for  bone health , especially in older age, but some studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids can also be beneficial.
People with higher omega-3 intakes and blood levels  may have  better  bone mineral density  (BMD).
However, it’s unclear whether fish oil supplements improve BMD. If there’s a benefit, it  may depend  on the type of fish oil the supplements are made of and how it’s made.

How to supplement
If you do not eat 1–2 portions of oily fish per week, you  may want  to consider taking a fish oil supplement.
Below is a list of  things to consider  when taking a fish oil supplement:
Dosage:  The  2020-2025 American Dietary Guidelines  recommend you eat at least 8 ounces (oz) of seafood per week for a 2,000-calorie diet. If you are pregnant or nursing, you’ll need to eat up to 12 oz.
Form:  Fish oil supplements come in a number of forms, including ethyl esters, triglycerides, reformed triglycerides, free fatty acids, and phospholipids. Your body  doesn’t absorb  ethyl esters as well as other forms.
Concentration:   Read the label  and choose a supplement that contains at least 500 milligrams (mg) of EPA and DHA per 1,000 mg of fish oil.
Purity:  To make sure the supplement contains the ingredients it lists on its labels, choose one that’s third-party tested or has a seal of purity from the Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s ( GOED ).
Freshness:  Omega-3 fatty acids are prone to oxidation, which makes them go rancid. To avoid this, choose a supplement that contains an antioxidant, such as  vitamin E . Don’t use a fish oil supplement that has a rancid smell or is out of date.

Frequently asked questions about fish oil
According to the National Institutes of Health, the recommended dietary intake (RDI) per day for total omega-3 is  1,100 mg for women and 1,600 mg for men .
You should not take fish oil supplements if you are allergic to seafood or without consulting a doctor. Ask your doctor first if you’re taking medications like blood thinning drugs or hormonal medications like birth control pills. or if you have any chronic health conditions.
A  2020 study  found that DHA-enriched fish oil supplements increased testosterone levels in overweight and obese men. However, additional research is needed to substantiate these findings.

The bottom line
Omega-3s contribute to typical brain and eye development. They  fight inflammation  and may help  prevent heart disease  and a decline in brain function.
Because fish oil contains a lot of omega-3s, people who are at risk of these health conditions can benefit from taking it.
However, eating whole foods is almost always better than taking supplements, and eating two portions of oily  fish  per week can provide you with  enough omega-3s .
In fact, fish is as effective as fish oil at preventing many diseases — if not more so.
That said, fish oil supplements are a good alternative if you don’t eat fish.
