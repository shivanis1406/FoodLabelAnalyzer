Title: Greens Powders: Are They Worth It and Which Ones Are the Best?

Greens powders may provide a boost of important nutrients, but research on their benefits is lacking. Our dietitians picked the seven best greens powders worth considering if you’re interested in trying them.

Greens powders are gaining popularity as a convenient way to increase your nutrient intake. These vibrantly hued powders include nutrients from round leafy greens, grasses, some fruits, and a variety of other ingredients, such as digestive enzymes, prebiotics, and probiotics.
However, the scientific backing for the benefits of greens powders is pretty thin, and some of the research is funded by supplement manufacturers, introducing a conflict of interest. Not to mention, they tend to come with a hefty price tag.
Nevertheless, if you’re interested in trying them, Healthline’s dietitians reviewed the research and combed through some of the most popular products on the market to help you decide whether greens powders are worth your money.

All of the greens powders on our list offer packages with 30 servings — about a month’s worth. Some may also be sold as travel sticks or in 15-, 60-, or 100-serving packages.
We based the price ratings on the approximate monthly cost for each product:

Why we like it:  Our reviewer was pleasantly surprised by the taste of AG1, likening it to matcha powder, but less bitter.
AG1 also stands out for its dedication to testing. Every batch is  NSF Certified for Sport  — a third-party certification that ensures that products contain what they claim to on their labels and are free of substances banned by most competitive sport organizations.
AG1 is also manufactured in a facility registered by the  Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) , an Australian regulatory body that ensures safe production of vitamins and supplements.
According to AG1, the powder contains 75 ingredients that serve to help support energy levels, exercise recovery, and gut and  immune health .
Taste and texture:  Most reviewers say the powder mixes well, though some complain of a chalky mouthfeel and an unpleasant aftertaste. Our tester noted that the taste is similar to matcha powder.
Considerations:  While there’s some research on the benefits of individual ingredients found in AG1, the powder itself hasn’t been studied to confirm them. Furthermore, because the amounts of many of these ingredients aren’t listed on the label, it’s unclear whether they’re present in effective doses.
Finally, keep in mind that several of AG1’s ingredients — such as  rhodiola , eleuthero, rose hip, and alfalfa — are not safe or appropriate for everyone.
In particular, one or more of these ingredients — such as  rhodiola  and  eleuthero  — are not recommended for people who are pregnant, nursing, or taking certain medications, including blood thinners, hormonal birth control, and blood pressure medications.
Healthline editor  Christina Snyder  tested AG1 and reported back, “I liked the taste of AG1 far more than I expected to.
“It’s similar to a matcha taste. That’s really the closest thing I can compare it to. It’s not bitter; it’s lightly sweet. It does taste ‘green’ if that makes sense, but not in a bad way. It doesn’t taste like kale. It’s actually very pleasant, and I looked forward to drinking it every day.”

Why we like it:  Ora Organic Easy Being Green is the most affordable powder on our list, coming in at just $1.17 per serving.
This greens powder carries the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) organic certification, and is gluten-, dairy-, and soy-free, as well as vegan and non-GMO. The product is also third-party tested for purity and potency, with certificates of analysis available on the company’s website.
Each scoop provides a blend of organic greens, including wheatgrass, barley grass, alfalfa, kale, spinach, spirulina, and more.
Taste and texture:  During testing, we found the powder to be very earthy, with the tiniest hint of orange. While monk fruit sometimes has a slight aftertaste, we didn’t find it to be that noticeable.
In terms of texture, the powder was easy to mix — we just stirred one scoop into a glass of water. However, the consistency was pretty gritty, which isn’t uncommon with greens powders.
Considerations:  This greens powder contains ashwagandha, which may be helpful for  improving sleep and stress , but people who are pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid it. It may also interact with  certain medications , including those for high blood pressure, diabetes, and thyroid conditions.
Registered dietitian and Healthline editor Kelli McGrane tried Ora as part of a taste test.
According to McGrane, “The powder was very easy to mix, though the texture was quite gritty. I only mixed it with water, so this might not be an issue if you plan on using it in a smoothie.
“However, the biggest difference between it and the other two products I tried was how earthy it tasted, which might be a dealbreaker for some.
“That said, it’s one of the more affordable options and boasts high quality ingredients, so it might be worth the taste trade-off if you’re OK with mixing this powder into a smoothie or other flavored beverage.”

Why we like it:  Amazing Grass Greens Blend is vegan-friendly and gluten-free. It’s also a bit more cost-effective than others on the market, though still not exactly cheap.
Amazing Grass Greens Blend Original contains seven types of nutritious greens and two servings of fruits and vegetables per 1-scoop (8-gram) serving.
The blend also contains digestive enzymes, probiotics, and fiber, which the brand claims can support and improve digestion.
Taste and texture:  The taste of this greens powder partially depends on which flavor you choose, though all the flavors get mixed reviews for taste. Many reviewers mention a strong grassy taste, but preferences vary.
Similarly, the reviews on the texture of this product are mixed, with many people saying it has a gritty texture and needs to be mixed very well.
Considerations:   The research  on the  benefits of digestive enzymes  and probiotics in healthy individuals is mixed. And these ingredients may not be appropriate for people with  certain digestive disorders .
Another ingredient to be cautious of is  rose hip , which hasn’t been well studied in people who are pregnant or nursing.

Why we like it:  Primal Greens is unflavored, making it a versatile option that could be mixed into a variety of beverages without altering their taste significantly.
It’s also sweetened with  stevia , which may make the unflavored taste more pleasant on its own, though some people dislike the aftertaste of stevia.
Primal Greens are manufactured in a good manufacturing practices (GMP) certified facility, though it’s not third-party tested. This product is also non-GMO and free of eggs, gluten, soy, dairy, and gelatin.
Taste and texture:  Reviews describe the taste of Primal Greens to be earthy and grassy, like most greens powders. This product also has a slight sweetness to it, thanks to its inclusion of stevia, though some people dislike the aftertaste.
Considerations:  As with many greens powders, this contains a few proprietary blends, making it difficult to know whether you’re consuming an effective dose or if the dose could be an issue for some individuals.
What’s more, this product contains more than 100 ingredients, which far surpasses others on our list, so be diligent in reading the label thoroughly.
Adaptogenic mushrooms , maitake, reishi and shiitake, are included in the ingredients. While there’s some  preliminary research  suggesting these to be beneficial,  certain individuals , such as people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or taking certain medications, should avoid consuming them.

Why we like it:  For those who are not fans of the typical grassy taste of a greens powder, Bloom Greens & Superfoods might be a good choice.

There are six different flavors to choose from, including Mango, Berry, Orange Passionfruit, Lemon, Strawberry Kiwi, and Coconut, all of which are sweetened with stevia. There’s also an unflavored option.

Bloom Nutrition is a female-founded company that aims to create good-tasting supplements made from high quality ingredients. Its products, including this greens powder, are non-GMO and free from common allergens, including soy, dairy, and gluten.

Taste and texture:  Customers frequently comment on the pleasant taste and praise the powder for being easy to mix thanks to its fine texture. However, like others on our list, some customers don’t enjoy the aftertaste of stevia.

Considerations:  Bloom Greens & Superfoods is not third-party tested for purity and potency. Additionally, like many greens powders, it contains proprietary blends. Use caution when reading the label and deciding if it’s the right fit for you and your needs.

It also includes an adaptogenic blend with ingredients like ashwagandha, rhodiola, and eleuthero, which should be avoided by those who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or taking certain medications.

Why we like   it:  Live It Up Super Greens has a refreshing minty taste that lacks an artificial aftertaste, which is often present with other greens powders.
The powder is third-party tested for purity and potency. It’s also vegan-friendly and contains organic ingredients. Though, unlike Ora, the powder isn’t certified vegan or certified organic by the USDA.
In addition to a handful of greens powders, including spinach and kale, each 1-scoop serving also contains 5 billion CFUs of dairy-free probiotics.
Taste and texture:  During testing, we found the powder easy to mix, though the consistency was quite gritty. The Original flavor has a strong mint taste that we found refreshing, but it may not be everyone’s cup of tea.
Considerations:  Like many greens powders, Live It Up Super Greens contains proprietary blends. Use caution when reading the label and deciding if it’s the right fit for you and your needs.

It also includes ingredients that may not be safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding and that have the potential to interact with certain medications.
Finally, because it does contain some nutrients in high amounts, it’s best to not take this powder if you’re already taking a multivitamin.
McGrane noted that the first time she tried Live It Up Super Greens she was taken back by how strong the mint flavor was. However, when she tried it again (and was prepared for the punch of mint), she enjoyed the flavor much more and found the drink to be refreshing.
According to McGrane, “While there is still a grittiness to the texture, overall, this powder is the most refreshing of the three I’ve tried. I also appreciate that there isn’t an artificial sweetness or unpleasant lingering aftertaste.”

Why we like it:  For those looking for a refreshing option, Kaged Organic Greens Elite is worth considering, as long as you don’t mind the aftertaste of  erythritol . Plus, it’s available in three fruity flavors: Lemon, Berry, and Apple Cinnamon.
Additionally, because it doesn’t include proprietary blends, this powder is a good option for people who prefer to know exact amount of each ingredient present in their greens powder.
Kaged Organic Greens Elite is non-GMO verified and free from major allergens. Products are also manufactured in NSF certified facilities and some products are third-party tested to ensure purity and potency.
However, it’s unclear whether Greens Elite is regularly tested by third-party labs to ensure label accuracy.

Taste and texture:  During testing, we found this powder very easy to mix. While there was still a slight grittiness, it was much less noticeable than Ora’s and Live It Up’s powders. In terms of taste, it has a very strong artificial flavor and aftertaste. If you dislike sugar alcohols, you’re likely not going to like this powder.

Considerations:  This product contains apple cider vinegar, which may help support digestion and nutrient absorption, among other benefits. While some studies suggest potential health advantages like weight management and  improved blood sugar levels , the evidence isn’t conclusive, particularly for vinegar in powdered form.

Also included is ashwagandha, an adaptogen that’s not suitable for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding and that may interact with certain medications.

The product is sweetened with erythritol, a sugar alcohol that has an aftertaste that some people dislike.

According to McGrane, “When mixed with just water, Kaged Elite Greens Lemon had a strong lemony, matcha-like flavor that I would have enjoyed more if it wasn’t for the erythritol aftertaste. Aftertaste aside, the drink is refreshing, and I could see it being enjoyable for people who don’t mind erythritol.
“Texture-wise, the powder mixed easily in a glass of water and only had a slight grittiness.”

Comparison of the best greens powders
Here is a quick look at how our top two picks compare:
*Third-party testing refers to whether products are tested by independent organizations to confirm the accuracy of the label and purity of the ingredients.

How we chose
Healthline’s dietitians looked at more than 25 popular greens powders on the market. Ultimately, 16 products passed both our dietitians’ review and our internal vetting process, and 7 stood out to us.
We determined the best greens powders using the following criteria:
Appropriate claims and disclaimers:  We automatically ruled out products with overly exaggerated health claims, particularly those promising a “ detox ” benefit. Additionally, all the products on our list are in compliance with  supplement labeling guidelines  established by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Brand reputation:  We looked for products manufactured by well-known, reputable brands.
Customer reviews:  We included products with mostly favorable online reviews. We also considered consumer feedback on each powder’s taste and texture.
Ingredient and nutrition quality:  We looked for products that are low in added sugars and contain few or no artificial additives and preservatives.
Variety:  We included products to suit a range of budgets and dietary needs and preferences.
Vetting:  The products on our list have been vetted to ensure that they align with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being. You can read more about  our vetting process .

How to choose a greens powder
If you decide to try a greens powder, here are a few factors to consider while shopping for one:
Quality testing:  To ensure that the contents match the label, look for a product that’s tested for purity and potency, ideally by a trusted third-party organization, such as  NSF International ,  USP , or  Labdoor .
Health claims:  Health claims that sound too good to be true typically are. Do your research before purchasing a product, and keep in mind that even if a product contains research-backed ingredients, they may not be present in large enough amounts to have the desired effect.
Price:  Greens powders aren’t cheap. When determining which product best fits your budget, be sure to consider the cost per serving. You can often score discounts by signing up for a monthly subscription.
Flavors:  Many greens powders are unflavored, though some have flavor options. To determine which option is right for you, consider how you plan on consuming your powder. For example, if you plan to drink it with just water, you may want to opt for a flavored product.
Ingredients:  It’s important to carefully read the supplement label and ingredient list to ensure that a product is safe for you to take and fits your dietary needs and preferences. If you’re unsure whether a product is right for you, talk with a doctor, a registered dietitian, or another healthcare professional.
Nutrient amounts:  If you’re already taking a  multivitamin  or another supplement containing vitamins and minerals, be sure to compare the supplement facts labels to ensure that you’re not consuming excessive amounts of any nutrients listed.
Many greens powders contain proprietary blends, which are unique combinations of ingredients made by the manufacturer. While the types of ingredients are listed, manufacturers don’t have to list the specific amounts of each ingredient present.
With proprietary blends, it can be difficult to know whether you’re consuming an effective dose of a given ingredient. Additionally, undisclosed amounts can be an issue for people with sensitivities to some ingredients, including stimulants like caffeine.

Potential benefits of greens powders
Because greens powders tend to contain a wide variety of  vitamins and minerals , they may help support the intake of certain nutrients, much like a  multivitamin .
Older research  suggests that greens powders may help reduce blood pressure in people with  hypertension , which in turn could help reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease.
Still, research on greens powders is limited, and most studies are  more than 10 years old .
While more research is needed, these powders do contain some ingredients that have been shown to have health benefits.
For example, certain vitamins and minerals, such as  B vitamins  and iron, may help  support energy levels  in people who have deficiencies in these nutrients.  Caffeine  is another energy-boosting ingredient you may find in these blends.
Several products also contain  adaptogens , such as  ashwagandha , which may help lower stress levels and improve mood.

Potential downsides
As with all supplements, there are some potential downsides of greens powders to consider before trying them.
Here are a few important considerations:
May not have the benefits they claim:  Research on the safety and health benefits of greens powders is limited. And because some ingredients found in these powders may interact with each other, it’s hard to determine whether a specific product formulation will have its intended effects even if it contains research-backed ingredients.
May contain heavy metals and contaminants:  As with other supplements, like protein powders, there’s always a risk that a greens powder may contain heavy metals, such as lead, or other potentially harmful contaminants. For this reason, it’s best to choose products that are third-party tested for purity and potency.
May contain ingredients that are not safe or appropriate for everyone:  Greens powders often contain herbal ingredients that aren’t safe or appropriate for  people who are pregnant , nursing, or taking certain prescription medications. Some products may also contain ingredients that are banned by competitive sports organizations.
Potential for excessive nutrient intake:  As with any supplement that contains more than 100% of the daily value for some nutrients, there’s a risk of  excessive nutrient intake , especially if you also take other supplements.  Fat-soluble vitamins  (vitamins A, D, E, and K), in particular, can accumulate in your body and lead to toxicity.
Cost:  Greens powders tend to be expensive, with some products costing $75 or more per container. Given the lack of strong evidence-based benefits of these supplements, consuming whole fruits and vegetables remains a cheaper and superior option.
Read more on the potential benefits and downsides of greens powders.
While  green smoothies  may not be as convenient, they offer a more affordable alternative to pricey greens powders.
Here are some tips for making green smoothies:
Blend the greens with your liquid of choice before adding the rest of your ingredients.
Use frozen fruit.
Make  spinach ice cubes .
Sprinkle in nutrient-rich seeds, such as chia or hemp seeds.
Add a source of protein.
Consider using a blender that doubles as a cup.

Who are greens powders for?
While greens powders are nutritious, they’re not a substitute for whole foods.
However, some people may still benefit from greens powders, including those who:
don’t eat fruits or vegetables
have trouble meeting their micronutrient needs through diet alone
have digestive or  malabsorption  issues
Like any other supplement, greens powders may not be suitable or appropriate for some people, such as:
children
people who are pregnant or nursing
people who take certain prescription medications
people who take other dietary supplements
people with certain digestive disorders
people with certain food allergies, especially to wheat
people with  end-stage kidney disease  (this is especially true for products high in potassium)
competitive athletes (unless a product is certified safe for sport)

Frequently asked questions
Greens powders may be helpful for people who have difficulty meeting their micronutrient needs or don’t typically eat fruits and vegetables. However, they’re unlikely to make a meaningful difference for people who already follow a mostly balanced diet.

The bottom line
Greens powders have become increasingly popular thanks to their convenience and enticing health claims.
While there may be some benefit to increasing your overall nutrient intake, research supporting greens powders is limited.
Additionally, greens powders may not be safe or appropriate for some people, including those who are pregnant, nursing, taking certain prescription medications, or taking other dietary supplements.
Ultimately, greens powders may not be worth the cost for some people, and they shouldn’t be used as a replacement for eating  whole fruits and vegetables .
