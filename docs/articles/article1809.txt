Title: 10 Healthy Homemade Mayonnaise Recipes



Making homemade mayonnaise is easy, and it tastes better than most store-bought versions.
In addition, you can choose to include only healthy ingredients in your mayo.
This way, you can avoid the refined vegetable oils that most commercial brands use.
You can also experiment with your mayo, adding many different ingredients and flavors.
Here is a very basic recipe to make your own homemade mayonnaise:
2 raw  egg  yolks, preferably  pastured .
1 cup quality  oil  like  avocado oil  or light  olive oil .
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice.
1 tablespoon  water .
Sea  salt .
Instructions:
Before you start, make sure all the ingredients are at room temperature.
Put the egg yolks in a food processor or blender. Sprinkle with salt and add water.
Start blending while  slowly  pouring the oil into the feed tube.
After the mayo has gotten thick, add lemon juice and gently mix with a spoon.
However, note that the egg yolks in mayo aren’t cooked. If salmonella is a problem where you live, then this may be a concern ( 1 ).
And, while the basic recipe above is great to start with, there is more to mayonnaise than just oil and eggs. It can be prepared using many different ingredients.
