Title: What are the Health Benefits of Coltsfoot?

Coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara) is a flower in the daisy family that’s been used for medicinal purposes. However, research suggests there may be negative effects associated with it.
Used as an herbal tea, proponents claim that Coltsfoot can treat respiratory infections, sore throats, gout, flu, and fever. However, there’s limited human research backing any of these claims.
The use of coltsfoot is also controversial. Some research has found that it can have negative side effects and has even been linked to complications like liver damage and blood clots.
Read on to learn more about the potential benefits and risks of coltsfoot.

Potential benefits of coltsfoot
Test-tube and animal studies have shown that coltsfoot may have some benefits. However, these haven’t been replicated in high quality human studies.
Coltsfoot is often promoted as a natural remedy for inflammatory conditions like asthma and  gout , a type of arthritis. However, research on using coltsfoot for these specific conditions is lacking.
One  2018 study  on mice found that tussilagone, an active component in coltsfoot, reduced several inflammatory markers in mice with drug-induced colitis. Another  rodent study  showed that tussilagone helped block specific pathways involved in regulating inflammation.
Despite this, there isn’t evidence that the same benefits apply to humans, or that it’s safe.
Some research suggests that coltsfoot could influence  brain health .
For example, a  2018 animal study  showed that administering coltsfoot extract decreased brain cell damage from stroke that was induced by decreased blood flow. It also prevented tissue death in the brain and reduced inflammation.
However, there’s little evidence that this applies to humans.  One review  stated that more in vitro and in vivo studies were needed to determine how effective and safe coltsfoot is as a remedy.
In traditional herbal medicine, coltsfoot is often used as a natural remedy for respiratory conditions like bronchitis, asthma, and whooping cough. Research in animals suggests that coltsfoot could help relieve chronic coughing.
One older  animal study  found that treating mice with a mixture of coltsfoot compounds helped reduce cough frequency. It was also linked to increased secretion of sputum and decreased inflammation.
Despite these results, high quality human studies are needed.

Potential side effects
Although coltsfoot may be linked to possible health benefits, several serious concerns exist about its safety. This is because coltsfoot contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), compounds  that may cause  acute and chronic liver damage when taken orally.
Several case reports link herbal products containing coltsfoot to serious side effects.
In one  1988 case study , a woman drank coltsfoot tea throughout her pregnancy. This resulted in a fatal blockage of the blood vessels leading to her newborn baby’s liver. A  2012 case report  details a man who developed a blood clot in his lung after taking a supplement containing coltsfoot and other herbs.
There’s currently insufficient research on the effects of coltsfoot in humans.

Dosage
Due to its potential toxicity, coltsfoot is not typically recommended. It has even been banned in countries like Germany and Austria.
However, scientists have developed variations of the coltsfoot plant that are free of harmful compounds and believed to be a safe alternative for use in herbal supplements. Still, it’s best to moderate your intake to avoid any adverse effects.
Coltsfoot is not recommended for children, infants, or  pregnant people . If you have  liver disease , heart problems, or other underlying health conditions, it’s best to speak with a healthcare professional before supplementing.

The takeaway
Coltsfoot is a plant long used in herbal medicine for respiratory conditions, gout, flu, colds, and fever.
Animal studies link it to several health benefits, including reduced inflammation, brain damage, and coughing. However, it contains several toxins and may cause serious harm, including liver damage and cancer.
