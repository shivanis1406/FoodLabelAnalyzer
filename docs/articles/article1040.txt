Figuring out what to order from Starbucks can be tricky when you’re trying to eat healthy.
In fact, some of their trademark drinks and coffees may contain more sugar, carbs, and calories than some of their desserts.

Fortunately, there are lots of healthy options available, including several low calorie, low sugar, low fat, and gluten-free selections.
Here are 13 of the healthiest Starbucks drinks, along with some gluten-free foods on their menu ( 1 ).
