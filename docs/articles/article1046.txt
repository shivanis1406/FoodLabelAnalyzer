Potential benefits
Aniston’s diet plan may be associated with several health benefits.
The diet focuses on nutrient-rich foods and limits processed ingredients, which are often high in sugar and calories that can contribute to weight gain.
This could benefit weight loss. Studies associate regular intake of processed foods with an increased chance of having overweight or obesity ( 1 ,  2 ).
Similarly, consuming more foods and drinks high in added sugar may be tied to weight gain ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
Additionally, the diet encourages consuming plenty of protein. Protein can help regulate your appetite, keep you feeling fuller for longer, and  boost weight loss  ( 6 ).
Aniston also practices intermittent fasting, which has been shown to promote weight loss. For example, a review of 27 studies found intermittent fasting to be as effective for weight loss as calorie restriction ( 7 ).
Several components of Aniston’s diet could support better blood sugar control.
For instance, studies show that intermittent fasting could improve short-term  blood sugar control  in people with type 2 diabetes, especially within the first 3–6 months ( 8 ).
Aniston’s diet also limits foods and drinks high in added sugar. Added sugar may be linked to increased blood sugar levels and a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes ( 9 ,  10 ).
Foods rich in fiber and protein are also encouraged. Both of these can support healthy blood sugar levels ( 11 ,  12 ).
There’s no doubt that what you put on your plate can play a big role in the development of disease.
Aniston’s diet, in particular, emphasizes nutrient-rich foods like fruits and vegetables. These may help protect against chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer ( 13 ,  14 ).
It also limits  processed foods , which often lack essential nutrients while being high in added sugar and less beneficial ingredients.
Studies also show that eating more processed foods could be linked to a higher risk of heart disease, cancer, depression, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and obesity ( 15 ,  16 ).
Certain parts of Jennifer Aniston’s diet could support weight loss, improve blood sugar control, and protect against disease.

Potential downsides
Aniston has provided details about her diet and exercise routine in several interviews, and there are no official rules or restrictions for the plan. So, it may not be a good fit for those who prefer more structured diets with detailed guidelines.
The plan may also be somewhat time consuming, since it limits your intake of convenience meals and involves exercising at least 5 days per week.
If you decide to work with a personal trainer like Aniston, it can also become expensive.
Additionally, intermittent fasting may  not be suitable  for everyone, including those who are pregnant, people with certain medical conditions, and individuals with a history of disordered eating.
Intermittent fasting could also cause several short-term side effects, including fatigue, irritability, increased hunger, and impaired concentration ( 17 ).
