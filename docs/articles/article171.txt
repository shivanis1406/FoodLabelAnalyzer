What to consider while shopping for gym shoes
Figuring out what shoe works best for you and your body can be tricky, especially since your needs can change over time — and even over the course of the day.
Fit  is key. Your chosen shoe should be tailored to your needs. For example,  treadmill runners  require a different type of shoe than those who  cycle  or  lift weights .
Still, some variables remain unchanged. Good gym shoes should be firm but flexible, offering support but allowing your foot to function. They should likewise allow you to  maintain a proper stance or gait .
You should also invest in a pair of shoes that provides ample cushioning and grip. However, these variables will be subjective, and the best way for you to choose the right pair is to try them out yourself.
We use “men’s” and “women’s” in this article to align with how products are sold on retail sites, but that doesn’t mean you need to stick to one or the other. Choose the product with the fit, style, and features that work best for you.

Frequently asked questions
There are many different ways to stretch gym shoes. If you need just a little extra stretch, you may choose to wear them around the house for a few days. For more of a stretch, you can fill a zip-top bag partially with water and place it inside the shoe. Then, place the shoe and bag in the freezer overnight.
Running shoes don’t provide as much support and stability for side-to-side or lateral movements as cross-training shoes. As a result, they’re not typically recommended for gym-style training. However, you can still choose to use them at the gym.
You’ll want to follow the manufacturer’s directions for washing your gym shoes. Many shoes can be washed in the washing machine, but it may be recommended to hand wash them to help your shoes last longer. Using cold water in the washing machine can help to keep colors from running. You’ll also want to remove laces and insoles before washing for a more thorough cleaning.

The bottom line
Whether you prefer to sweat it out on the treadmill or work out in the weightlifting area, there’s a perfect gym shoe to fit every need.
When shopping for gym shoes, be sure to consider the types of exercises you plan on doing, your foot shape, and your budget.
By using this list as a guide, we’re confident you’ll find the right pair of kicks to keep you safe and comfortable at the gym.
