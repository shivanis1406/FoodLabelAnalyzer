Title: The 20 Best Low Carb Vegetables (Plus 1 Great Low Carb Fruit)

A wide variety of vegetables, including bell peppers, asparagus, zucchini, and broccoli, can add important nutrients to a low carb diet.
The definition of a low carb diet varies widely. Most are under  130 grams (g)  of carbs per day, and some go as low as 20 g per day.
Vegetables are low in calories but rich in vitamins, minerals, and other important nutrients. In addition, many are low in carbs and high in fiber, making them ideal for low carb diets.

Low carb vegetables
Here is a list of the 20 best low carb vegetables to include in your diet.

1. Bell peppers
Bell peppers , also known as sweet peppers or capsicums, are incredibly nutritious.
They contain antioxidants called  carotenoids , which  may help :
reduce inflammation
decrease cancer risk
protect against oxidative damage from cholesterol and fats
One cup (149 g) of chopped red pepper contains  9 g  of carbs, 3 g of which are fiber.
This serving size also provides 26% of the Daily Value (DV) for vitamin A and 212% of the DV for vitamin C, which is  often lacking  in very low carb diets.
Green, orange, and yellow bell peppers have similar nutrient profiles, although their antioxidant contents may vary.

2. Broccoli
Broccoli  is a member of the  cruciferous vegetable family .
A  2021 animal study  found that broccoli may help decrease  insulin resistance , which could help in the management of  type 2 diabetes .
Broccoli may also help  protect against  several types of cancer, including prostate cancer.
One cup (91 g) of raw broccoli contains  6 g  of carbs, 2 g of which are fiber.
It also provides 90% of the DV for vitamin C and 77% of the DV for vitamin K.

3. Asparagus
Asparagus  is a delicious spring vegetable.
One cup (180 g) of cooked asparagus contains  7 g  of carbs, 4 g of which are fiber. It’s also a good source of vitamins A, C, and K.
Animal studies suggest that asparagus may  help improve  cognitive performance and brain health.

4. Mushrooms
Mushrooms  are extremely low in carbs.
A one-cup (70-g) serving of raw  white mushrooms  contains just  2 g  of carbs, 1 g of which is fiber.
In a  2016 study  involving males with metabolic syndrome, eating 3.5 ounces (100 g) of white mushrooms for 16 weeks significantly improved antioxidant and anti-inflammatory markers.

5. Zucchini
Zucchini  is a popular vegetable and the most common type of summer squash.
One cup (124 g) of raw zucchini contains  4 g  of carbs, 1 g of which is fiber. It’s a good source of  vitamin C , providing 25% of the DV per serving.
Yellow Italian squash and other types of summer squash have carb counts and nutrient profiles similar to zucchini.

6. Spinach
Spinach  is a leafy green vegetable that provides major health benefits.
Research suggests it may help  protect heart health , lower blood pressure, and  decrease the risk  of common eye diseases like  cataracts  and  macular degeneration .
One cup (180 g) of cooked spinach provides more than  seven times  the DV for  vitamin K .
Spinach is also low in carbs, but the carbs become more concentrated as the leaves are cooked down and lose their volume.
For example, one cup of cooked spinach contains  7 g  of carbs with 4 g of fiber, whereas one cup of raw spinach contains 1 g of carbs with almost  1 g  of fiber.
