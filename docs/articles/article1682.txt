Title: 11 Signs That You’re Not Eating Enough

Ever wonder if you’re eating enough? Listen to your body. There are usually physical signs of not eating enough, like constant hunger or irritability.
Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight for your body can be challenging, especially in a society where food is constantly available.
But not getting enough calories can also be a concern — whether it’s due to intentional food restriction, decreased appetite, or other reasons.
In fact, undereating on a regular basis can lead to a number of mental, physical, and emotional health issues. We dive into 11 signs that you may not be eating enough.

1. Being underweight
To  evaluate your weight , you may want to start with your body mass index (BMI). The  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute  provides a chart showing BMIs based on your weight and height.
That said, BMI doesn’t take into account many factors that affect weight, which can vary from person to person.
According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , the average weight and height of adults over the age of 20 are as follows:
Still, researchers have determined that a waist circumference equal to or less than  80–90 centimeters (cm)  or 31–35 inches is considered “normal.”
However, these normal values were developed to apply only to white adults. The researchers cite alternative research that was developed to represent African American adults. These values were 76–78 cm or 29–30 inches.
With this research in mind, the average waist circumference values of American adults are actually too high.
If you’re significantly below any of the above values, it may mean you’re considered underweight. Anything above these values increases a person’s chances of developing various health problems, such as  heart disease .
That said, being underweight doesn’t necessarily mean you’re not eating enough.
There are other reasons for excessive weight loss, such as heavy exercise,  malabsorption , or other underlying health conditions. Reaching out to a doctor is the best way to determine whether you’re eating enough for your body’s needs.
You might be considered underweight if your BMI or weight is too low, according to national guidelines. But there are many factors that influence weight, and this doesn’t necessarily mean you’re not eating enough.

2. Low energy levels
When you  don’t get enough calories , you’ll likely feel tired most of the time.
On average , people assigned female at birth (AFAB) should eat about 2,000 calories a day for weight maintenance and 1,500 for weight loss. People assigned male at birth (AMAB) should eat around 2,500 calories a day or 2,000 for weight loss.
These values are just averages and can differ depending on your sex, age, and level of exercise.
The  2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans  provide a full breakdown. You can also learn how many  calories are in a pound of body fat .
If you’re consuming fewer calories than the lower limits, you might not be eating enough to sustain your energy throughout the day.
Calories from food give us energy. Eating too few calories can lead to fatigue due to insufficient energy.

3. Hair loss
If you’re noticing an increased amount of hair accumulating in your hairbrush or shower drain, it  may be a sign  that you’re not eating enough or that you’re not getting enough important nutrients.
An inadequate intake of calories,  protein ,  biotin ,  iron , and  other nutrients  is a common cause of hair loss.
Hair loss can sometimes happen if you’re not getting enough calories, protein, and other nutrients.

4. Changes in hunger cues
Being hungry all the time is one obvious sign that you’re not eating enough food, but it isn’t the only one.
Appetite and  food cravings  can increase in response to drastic calorie restriction. This is due to changes in levels of hormones that control hunger and fullness.
For example, in a  2016 study  following mice for 3 months, they were fed a diet containing 40% fewer calories than usual. Researchers found that levels of the appetite-suppressing hormones  leptin  and  IGF-1  decreased in the mice while hunger signals increased significantly.
A  2021 study  examining calorie restriction in humans found that restricting calories didn’t lead to a notable decrease in hunger or appetite. But it also didn’t lead to increased hunger or appetite in people who had a low appetite to begin with.
More research is needed to understand how reducing calories may affect hunger and appetite in humans.
What’s more, fasting  has been shown  to increase the production of  cortisol , a stress hormone that has been linked to hunger and increased belly fat.
However, while calorie deprivation may have a hunger-increasing effect in some cases,  2019 research  suggests that calorie deprivation over a long time may actually make you feel less hungry and reduce food cravings.
Undereating can cause hormonal changes that increase your hunger in order to make up for missing calories and nutrients. However, in the long term, you may start to feel less hunger and have fewer food cravings.

5. Problems trying to get pregnant
Undereating may interfere with someone’s  ability to become pregnant .
The  hypothalamus  helps maintain your hormonal balance, including reproductive health. It receives signals from your body that let it know when hormone levels need to be adjusted.
Based on the signals it receives, the hypothalamus produces hormones that either stimulate or inhibit the production of  estrogen ,  progesterone , and other hormones.
Research from 2021  suggests that this complex system is highly sensitive to changes in calorie intake and weight.
When your calorie intake or  body fat percentage  drops too low, these signals may become impaired, leading to changes in the number of hormones released.
Without the proper balance of reproductive hormones, pregnancy cannot take place.  Amenorrhea  — the medical term for no menstrual period for  6 months or longer  — can be a sign of a reproductive hormone imbalance. If you haven’t had a period in  3 months or longer , you should see your doctor for an evaluation.
If you are trying to conceive, make sure to consume  a balanced diet  with a good amount of calories for your body. This will help your hormones function properly and improve your chances of a healthy pregnancy.
Consuming too few calories can disrupt reproductive hormone signals, leading to challenges in getting pregnant.

6. Mood problems
If little things have begun to set you off, it could be related to not eating enough.
Irritability was one of several issues experienced by young men who underwent extreme calorie restriction as part of the  Minnesota Starvation Experiment  during World War II.
Research on mice  has found that restricting calories by 60% or more could lead to various adverse effects, including irritability and other mood problems.
According to a  2023 study  on mice with obesity, calorie deprivation may increase anxiety behaviors.
On the other hand,  animal research from 2018  suggests that eating less may actually have an antidepressive effect.
So far, research on this topic has been conflicting and focused mainly on animals, so more research is needed to understand whether these same effects will occur in humans.
All that said, what affects our moods in terms of nutrition might be how much we eat  and  what we eat.
For instance, following the Mediterranean diet  has been shown  to reduce markers of inflammation, whereas eating high calorie foods containing unhealthy fats may actually inflame the immune system. This could affect mood and well-being.
Not getting enough calories and restrictive eating patterns have been linked to irritability and anxiety in some research, but it has been limited. More research on humans is necessary.

7. Feeling cold all the time
If you constantly feel cold, not eating enough food could be the cause.
Your body needs to burn a certain number of calories in order to create heat and maintain a healthy, comfortable body temperature.
Calorie restriction  can lead to  lower core body temperature. Overall, the more severely you slash calories, the colder you’re likely to feel.
Consuming too few calories can lead to a decrease in body temperature, as you need calories to create heat.

8. Constipation
Infrequent bowel movements may be related to low calorie intake. This isn’t surprising since consuming very little food will result in less waste in your digestive tract.
Constipation  is typically described as having fewer than three bowel movements per week or having small, hard stools that are difficult to pass. It’s  very common  in older adults and can be worsened by poor diet.
Research from 2022  suggests that eating fewer calories may be associated with a greater chance of constipation in women, and eating within the recommended calorie range can help reduce the chance of constipation in men.
The researchers also cite an older study suggesting that eating enough can reduce the chance of constipation in children as well.
If you’re having problems with  bowel regularity , it’s important to take a look at the amount of food you’re eating and evaluate whether you’re getting enough.
Not getting enough calories may be associated with constipation in women. This is partly due to less waste product in general, but also slower movement of food through the digestive tract.

9. Frequent illness
Research from 2016  has shown a relationship between eating fewer calories and immune system dysfunction.
This means that if you’re frequently sick, you might not be getting enough nutrients that are necessary for healthy immune system function.
Nutrients that are  important  for immune functioning include certain amino acids — arginine and tryptophan — as well as the following minerals and vitamins:
zinc
selenium
vitamin A
B vitamins  including B1, B2, B3, and B12
vitamin C
vitamin D
If you’re frequently getting sick, it may be related to undereating. Contact a doctor to determine if this is the cause or if something else might be affecting your immune system.

10. Impaired growth
Children and adolescents who are not growing as expected might not be eating enough. In younger children, this is known as  failure to thrive  or  delayed growth .
How much they eat and what they eat can  influence  growth hormones and cause them not to work properly, which can result in stunted growth.
The  CDC  provides growth charts showing the average expected weight and height of children from ages 0–18. But if your child falls under the average range, reach out to their pediatrician. It could be from malnutrition, but it could also be from other causes and underlying conditions.
If a child isn’t growing as expected, it might be from undereating. But delayed growth can also have other causes. Contact your child’s pediatrician for any concerns.

11. Skin problems
Not eating enough can  negatively affect  your skin. In some cases, it can cause the skin to thin, wrinkle, and even peel or tear.
The skin can also develop lesions, bruising,  broken blood vessels under the skin , and even more significant bleeding under the skin called  purpura .
A  2018 study  found an association between malnutrition and skin tears regardless of age or BMI.
Malnutrition is when your body is not getting all the nutrients it needs. This can be caused by not eating enough, but there can be other causes, such as underlying medical conditions.
There’s also some conflicting evidence that calorie restriction  may be beneficial  for the skin.
Not eating enough may negatively affect the skin, but more research is needed to understand the relationship between calorie reduction and how it affects the skin.

The bottom line
Although overeating increases the risk of developing health problems, undereating can also affect your health. This is especially true with severe or long-term calorie restriction.
If you notice any of the signs above, consider if you’re eating enough and then contact a healthcare professional for advice.
To make sure you’re getting enough to eat, the  Dietary Guidelines for Americans  suggest females get at least 1,600 calories a day and males at least 2,200 calories. These are the minimum values for weight maintenance.
Still, everyone’s body is different. You can always reach out to a doctor or dietitian for advice on what will work best for you.
If you believe you aren’t eating enough and need extra support, you may want to reach out to a healthcare professional or organization like the  National Alliance for Eating Disorders.
