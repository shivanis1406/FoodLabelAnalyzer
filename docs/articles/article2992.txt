Keep in mind that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not require manufacturers to disclose the exact amount of added caffeine in food products ( 6 ).
Therefore, the best way to determine exactly how much a specific product contains is to check the product’s website or reach out to the manufacturer directly.
