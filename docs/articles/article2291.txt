Adding oatmeal to your morning routine is a great way to increase your intake of whole grains.
Whether you prefer to make your  oatmeal  with rolled, instant, or steel cut oats, you’ll reap the benefits of boosting your intake of fiber, protein, antioxidants, and a variety of essential vitamins and minerals ( 1 ).
A 1/2-cup (40-gram) serving of rolled oats provides 4 grams of fiber, 5 grams of protein, and 0 grams added sugar — unless you add your own ( 2 ).

To avoid accidentally consuming gluten from contaminated oats, make sure you opt for oats that are certified gluten-free.

How to choose
Deciding which gluten-free cereal is best for you depends entirely on your personal goals.
Before making your final selection, you’ll want to consider the ingredient, sugar, and protein content, as well as the price, whether it’s certified gluten-free, and how you plan to use it.
In the United States, the FDA requires that any packaged food labeled gluten-free must contain fewer than 20 ppm of gluten. This threshold was chosen because it’s the lowest level that can be reliably detected using scientifically validated methods ( 5 ).
Notably, the FDA does not have a specific gluten testing standard for companies to comply with. Although each company is required to ensure products contain no more than 20 ppm of gluten, how they go about it may vary.
The lack of standardization regarding testing methods and frequency opens up more potential for inadvertent gluten exposure during processing. Thus, some people prefer to stick to products that are certified gluten-free by independent third-party organizations.
A variety of private organizations, such as the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO) and Allergen Control Group, provide gluten-free certification.
Many private certification organizations utilize the same 20 ppm gluten threshold that the FDA does, but some choose to set their own standards.
For instance, GFCO sets a threshold of 10 ppm gluten and requires the annual testing of all products, as well as the inspection of manufacturing facilities to maintain the certification.
If you have  celiac disease  or any other condition that requires strict avoidance of gluten, be sure to choose cereals that possess a gluten-free certification or check with the individual manufacturer to ensure compliance with FDA gluten-free labeling regulations.
If you intend to use cereal as the base of a complete meal, you may want to opt for those that are higher in protein and fiber. Alternatively, choose those that are easy to add complementary protein and fiber sources to.
For example, you could add nuts, seeds, or eggs to quinoa porridge, or sprinkle high protein granola over Greek yogurt.
Many of the most popular breakfast cereals contain lots of  added sugar . Excess added sugar intake may contribute to tooth decay and increase your risk of chronic conditions like heart disease and diabetes ( 6 ).
To minimize any potential health risks, the American Heart Association recommends limiting your intake of added sugar to no more than 25 grams per day for women and 37 grams per day for men ( 7 ).
If you’re trying to reduce your intake of added sugar or promote blood sugar balance, opt for cereals containing little or no sugar.
It may also be helpful to be particularly mindful of your portion sizes, as it can be easy to accidentally consume more servings of cereal than you intended to.
If you need a cereal for on-the-go snacking, you probably want to choose one of the cold options, as the hot versions will require more time and tools for preparation.
If versatility is a priority, muesli or granola-style cereals may be your best bet, as they can be served hot or cold, or used as a topping for yogurt, ice cream, or toast.
There’s no wrong answer, as long as you choose the one that meets your needs.

The bottom line
Finding high quality, nutritious gluten-free cereals can be challenging.
Fortunately, a variety of tasty options are certified gluten-free and won’t make you compromise on flavor or ingredients.
Before choosing a cereal, it’s important to consider its ingredients, nutritional profile, price, and how you want to use it.
Taking those features into account will help you choose the one that’s best suited for your needs.
