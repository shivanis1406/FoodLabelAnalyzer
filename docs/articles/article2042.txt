Title: How to Get Rid of Visceral Fat

You may be able to reduce visceral fat by reducing your intake of carbs and added sugar, among other dietary changes. Certain habits, such as getting enough sleep and performing aerobic exercise, can help.
Visceral fat exists inside your abdominal cavity and wraps around your internal organs.
Having too much visceral fat may  increase  your risk of cardiometabolic factors that could lead to chronic conditions like diabetes, obesity, and heart disease.
This type of fat is different from subcutaneous fat, which is the type of fat stored just below your skin that you can pinch easily.
Keep reading to learn more about how to get rid of visceral fat safely, effectively, and sustainably.

Eat a well-balanced diet
Following a  well-balanced diet  is one of the most important factors for managing body weight and visceral fat.
A balanced diet consists of eating whole foods like fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while minimizing  ultra-processed foods  and additives like sugar.
Research  suggests that maintaining a  calorie deficit  is the most important factor for losing weight. This means consuming fewer calories than you burn throughout the day.
However, experts recommend avoiding drastic calorie restrictions because they could lead to  nutrient deficiencies ,  starvation ,  yo-yo dieting , and other health complications.
Instead, consider reducing your daily calorie intake by  500 calories . This could help you lose around 1 pound (lb) weekly, which falls within the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ‘s weekly weight loss targets of 1 to 2 lb.
Other dietary tips may also contribute to getting rid of visceral fat, including:
eating more  high protein foods , such as eggs, lean meats, and nuts
eating more  high fiber foods , such as whole grains and legumes
eating foods high in  unsaturated fats  and  omega-3 fatty acids
limiting your intake of  added sugars ,  trans fats , and  alcohol
trying specific diets, such as the  Mediterranean diet ,  low carb diet , and  ketogenic diet

A lot of information about eating for weight loss is available online. Navigating this space may feel overwhelming, and not all of this information is backed by science, nor is it all safe.
If you’re unsure where to begin when making dietary changes for your visceral fat loss journey, consider speaking with a registered dietitian or a healthcare professional. They could help you develop a safe, sustainable, and effective eating plan.

Engage in physical activity
Exercise is one of the most important aspects of maintaining a moderate weight and managing visceral fat.
Moderate intensity  aerobic exercise , or cardio, may help increase your heart rate and  burn  visceral fat. Additionally,  research  shows that resistance training is key in reducing visceral fat while maintaining muscle mass.
Combining these two types of exercise with a well-balanced diet may be the  most effective  way to burn visceral fat.
The  Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans  recommend that adults exercise at a moderate intensity for at least 150 to 300 minutes weekly or at a high intensity for at least 75 to 150 minutes.
If you’re unsure where to begin, speak with a healthcare professional or personal trainer. They could help develop a safe and effective exercise plan that meets your goals.

Get plenty of sleep
Getting enough high quality sleep is vital for your health. According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , sleep plays a key role in:
maintaining a  healthy-for-you weight
preventing chronic conditions, such as  type 2 diabetes ,  stroke , and  high blood pressure
reducing stress and boosting your mood
Research  has found that a lack of sleep may raise your risk of visceral fat gain. Conversely, increasing your sleep may help reduce visceral fat.
The CDC recommends that adults get at least  7 hours  of sleep each night.

Reduce your stress levels
Some  research  suggests that chronic stress is associated with both visceral and subcutaneous fat.
What’s more, ongoing stress may also lead to  several behaviors  that could contribute to increasing visceral fat and body weight, including:
overeating
eating foods high in added sugars and calories
having a sedentary lifestyle
not getting enough sleep
Stress may also stimulate several hormones that could trigger hunger, such as  ghrelin .
Some ways to help reduce stress may include:
meditating
exercising
practicing  yoga
going for a walk
writing in a journal
speaking with a friend, family member, or therapist

Try probiotics and prebiotics
Probiotics  are live bacteria that can benefit your gut and digestive health. They’re found in foods like yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut and are available as supplements.
Prebiotics  are the foods that feed these bacteria and are essential for the health of your gut microbiome.
A  2022 study  found that supplementing with prebiotics and probiotics for 90 days helped reduce visceral fat by 35% in participants with overweight compared with those who supplemented with a placebo.
However, prebiotic and probiotic supplementation had no impact on body weight and  body fat percentage .
A  2021 review  also found that probiotic supplementation could help reduce visceral fat,  waist-to-hip ratio , and  body mass index (BMI) . These are all markers of chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease.
Despite these positive findings, more research is needed to fully support the use of prebiotic and probiotic supplementation for losing visceral fat.

Try intermittent fasting
Intermittent fasting  is an eating pattern that involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting. Unlike dieting, intermittent fasting doesn’t restrict foods. It simply focuses on when you should eat them.
A popular cycle is to  fast  for 16 hours and have an 8-hour eating window.
A  2022 study  found that intermittent fasting may be one of the most effective dietary remedies for:
losing visceral fat
boosting energy
managing hunger
improving cardiometabolic factors and body fat composition

The bottom line
Visceral fat is a type of fat that surrounds your organs. It’s associated with chronic health conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes.
Exercising, eating a well-balanced diet, and getting enough sleep are some of the key methods for burning visceral fat.
If you’re unsure where to begin on your fat loss journey, speak with a healthcare professional. They could develop a plan for you and recommend other professionals who might help, such as a personal trainer and registered dietitian.
