Title: The 10 Best Meal Replacement Bars

Regularly fueling your body with nutritious meals and snacks is essential for your overall health.
However, you may occasionally find yourself short on time and in need of a quick meal replacement to take on the go. Meal replacement bars are also a good choice for people who are traveling and don’t have access to healthy meals.
Additionally, if you’re hitting the trails on a backpacking or hiking trip, you may be searching for portable meal bars to keep you energized while exploring the great outdoors.
Keep in mind that although meal replacement bars are a great choice in a pinch or when trying to travel light, they should not be regularly relied upon if you have the ability to prepare complete meals.
Also, many bars that are advertised as meal replacements don’t contain nearly enough calories to constitute a meal. This is especially true for backpackers and hikers who burn a large number of calories per day.
The bars on this list are made with whole food ingredients and contain at least 250 calories per bar.
Even though some people may be satisfied with this number of calories for a light meal or snack, most people need many more calories per meal to maintain their weight, depending on their body size and activity level ( 1 ).
If you’re using bars to replace breakfast, lunch, or dinner, it’s a good idea to pair them with other foods to ensure you’re consuming enough calories.
Bars can be combined with other portable foods like hard-boiled eggs, trail mix, Greek yogurt, or fruit paired with nut butter or cheese to create a more complete meal.
Here are the 10 best meal replacement bars.

How to choose
When shopping for meal replacement bars, it’s important to consider why you’re using them as a meal replacement. If you simply need a quick option when you’re short on time, bars may be a good choice.
Likewise, people who are traveling, backpacking, or hiking may find that meal replacement bars are a convenient way to nourish themselves when preparing a meal isn’t an option.
However, if you’re using meal replacement bars to  lose weight , you may want to reconsider. Whenever possible, you should take the time to prepare whole, nourishing meals for yourself, especially when trying to lose excess body fat.
Although bars can be a convenient option to occasionally rely on for energy, they may not be best as a weight loss tool. As mentioned above, most meal bars are too low in calories for most people.
Consuming a bar with only a couple hundred calories as your breakfast, lunch, or dinner could result in you overeating at subsequent meals, which can derail your weight loss efforts.
Whether you’re trying to lose, maintain, or  gain weight , fueling your body with nourishing meals that contain the appropriate number of calories for your body size and activity level is key.
Regardless, when shopping for meal replacement bars, choose products that contain whole food ingredients like nuts, seeds, and dried fruits. Select bars that deliver at least 250 calories and contain no added sugar whenever possible.
Keep in mind that products made for hikers and backpackers who require a large number of calories per day usually contain added sugars and are high in fat to meet their energy demands. Under these circumstances, some added sugar is OK ( 3 ,  4 ).
Pairing bars under 300 calories with other nutrient-dense foods can help round out the meal and ensure you’re getting enough calories, as well as macronutrients and micronutrients.
Remember that  calorie needs  differ significantly depending on factors like age, sex, weight, and activity level. Talk to a registered dietitian if you’re unsure how many calories you should be consuming per day.

The bottom line
Although preparing complete meals is always the best option, meal replacement bars can be a great choice when you need a quick, nourishing fuel source.
When choosing a bar, make sure to pick products that are made with healthy ingredients like the bars listed above.
