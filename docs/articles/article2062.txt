Title: 13 of the Best Iodine Supplements in 2024

Iodine is an essential mineral that plays an important role in maintaining the health and function of your thyroid gland.
The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ located in your neck that produces specific hormones that help regulate growth and metabolism ( 1 ).
Iodine functions as a building block of the two main thyroid hormones — triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) ( 2 ).
If your iodine intake is too low, you can end up with low levels of thyroid hormone in your blood. This can lead to symptoms like swelling of the thyroid gland (also known as goiter), fatigue, dry skin, hair loss, difficulty regulating body temperature, and weight gain ( 1 ).
Iodine is naturally found in a variety of foods, such as seafood, dairy products, eggs, and seaweed. It may also be found in grains and some fruits and vegetables. However, the exact amount depends primarily on the iodine levels of the soil in which the crop was grown ( 1 ).
Given the variability in iodine levels in many plant-based foods, some countries have iodine-fortified foods available, such as iodized salt, to prevent deficiencies.
Even so, certain groups of people are at an increased risk of iodine deficiency, including ( 1 ):
people who are pregnant
people living in places where the soil is iodine-depleted
people following strict vegan and vegetarian diets
people who avoid or have limited access to iodized salt
If you have difficulty getting enough iodine in your diet, a healthcare professional may recommend that you take an iodine supplement.

The supplements on this list were chosen according to:
Vetting.  All the products included have been vetted to ensure that they meet Healthline’s medical and business standards.
Ingredient quality and effectiveness.  Quality and effectiveness of ingredients are extremely important in dietary supplementation. Most products on this list include forms of iodine with higher rates of bioavailability and absorption, such as potassium iodide and pure iodine found in whole food sources.
Price.  We considered overall cost. The cost per serving ranges from $0.04–$1.16 to accommodate a wide variety of preferences and budgets.
Manufacturing and testing standards.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not quality-test or regulate supplements as closely as medications. Thus, we made sure to include products that are made in facilities that adhere to current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs) and/or have been approved by independent third-party organizations such as NSF International, United States Pharmacopeia (USP), or ConsumerLab.

How to choose an iodine supplement
When choosing a nutritional supplement, you’ll want to consider a variety of factors, including the price, quality, ingredient content, and dosage.
Certain brands are more expensive than others, but price isn’t necessarily a good indicator of quality.
In certain countries, including the United States, nutritional supplements are not as tightly regulated as medications.
Thus, the safest option is to stick with supplements that are produced by reputable companies in CGMP-compliant facilities that maintain high manufacturing standards and routinely test their products for purity and potency.
Furthermore, it’s a good idea to choose supplements approved by third-party organizations such as NSF, USP, and ConsumerLab.
One of the best indicators of product quality is a certificate of analysis (COA), which is awarded to companies whose products have been vetted by third-party testing groups to help ensure safety and quality.
You’ll also want to inspect the ingredient label. If you’re looking to avoid any specific ingredients, such as added sugar, animal products,  artificial sweeteners , or allergens, always check the ingredient list before purchasing.
Finally, it’s important to evaluate the dosage. Supplements often contain more than the recommended daily amount of a nutrient, so you want to be careful that you don’t accidentally consume too much.
Conversely, if a healthcare professional recommends that you take a high dose, make sure to choose one that provides an adequate amount to meet your needs.

Dose:  150 mcg, or 68% of the DV during pregnancy (100% of the standard DV)
Iodine is a very important nutrient for sustaining a healthy pregnancy, but many  prenatal supplements  do not contain iodine at all.
Each serving of GLOW prenatal capsules provides 150 mcg of iodine, or 68% of the DV during pregnancy, alongside more than 20 other nutrients that support healthy prenatal development.
The brand claims that it always uses the highest quality, most absorbable nutrient forms and that all of its products are third-party tested for purity and potency.
The U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommend that people who are pregnant consume at least 220 mcg of iodine per day ( 1 ).
Thus, if you choose GLOW as your prenatal supplement, it’s still important to make sure you’re including  iodine-rich foods  in your diet to meet your daily needs.
Supplements are designed to fill nutrient gaps, but a balanced diet is still an integral part of a healthy pregnancy.

Safety precautions
It’s important to consult a healthcare professional prior to taking an iodine supplement, as getting too much can lead to very serious side effects.
Overconsuming iodine  can lead to symptoms similar to those of iodine deficiency, such as enlarged thyroid, fatigue, and weight gain. More serious side effects include inflammation of the thyroid gland and thyroid cancer ( 1 ).
Acute iodine toxicity is rare but can occur if high doses are taken without medical supervision. Symptoms of iodine toxicity include nausea, vomiting, fever, diarrhea, a weakened heartbeat, and a burning sensation in your throat and mouth ( 1 ).
The DV for iodine for healthy adults ages 18 and up is 150 mcg. If you are pregnant or nursing, the daily dose increases to 220 mcg and 290 mcg, respectively ( 1 ).
Iodine may negatively interact with some medications, such as  diuretics , certain types of blood-pressure-lowering medications, and medications used to treat hyperthyroidism ( 1 ).
Most serious adverse reactions occur when iodine intakes exceed 1,100 mcg per day for an extended period of time. Therefore, you should not attempt to take doses higher than the recommended daily amount without medical supervision ( 1 ).

When to see a doctor
If you take hyperthyroidism medications, ACE inhibitors, or potassium-sparing diuretics, you should consult your doctor before adding an iodine supplement to your routine since there is potential for drug-nutrient interaction ( 1 ).
If you suspect you have low iodine or an iodine deficiency, you can ask a healthcare professional about having your iodine level checked and thyroid function tests done in order to determine an optimal supplemental dose of iodine for you.

Frequently asked questions
Generally, yes, it is safe to take supplements containing iodine. However, many dietary supplements provide more than 100% of the DV of iodine, and it’s important to avoid high doses unless directed otherwise by a healthcare professional ( 1 ).
Iodine is found in iodized salt, dairy products, seafood, and eggs. It plays a role in thyroid health and immune health, as well as fetal growth and brain development ( 1 ).
People who follow diets low in iodine-containing foods, such as vegan or vegetarian diets, could benefit from regular supplementation to reduce the risk of iodine deficiency.
Iodine is also an essential nutrient during pregnancy, when the RDA for iodine increases from 150 mcg per day to 220 mcg per day ( 1 ).
People who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant should consult a healthcare professional about taking a prenatal supplement that is appropriate for their needs.
There is no conclusive evidence for the best time of day to take an iodine supplement. However, several medications may have unwanted side effects if taken at the same time as iodine-containing supplements ( 1 ).
To avoid potential drug-nutrient interactions, it may be generally advised to take your iodine supplement at least 1 hour before or after taking any medications.
But the safest approach is to talk with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to come up with a supplement regimen that’s best for you.
A small study published in 2002 found that human participants absorbed 96.4% of potassium iodide ( 4 ).
More recently, a 2022 study evaluated the bioavailability of natural iodine from brown algae and found that up to 90% of iodine was absorbed  in vivo  (in a living organism) versus much lower absorption rates found  in vitro  (in a petri dish or test tube) ( 5 ).
Goiter  is considered one of the earliest signs of low iodine, or iodine deficiency, and is often associated with hypothyroidism ( 1 ).
Goiter is characterized by noticeable swelling in the neck and may be accompanied by other symptoms, such as difficulty swallowing, a hoarse voice, or coughing.
Some of the more common signs of  hypothyroidism  are fatigue, weight gain, depression, a frequent cold feeling, and constipation.
Severely low iodine during pregnancy can result in fetal growth and development issues, miscarriage, or stillbirth ( 1 ).
Studies also suggest that people with chronically low iodine intake have a higher risk of thyroid cancer ( 1 ,  6 ).

The bottom line
Iodine is an essential mineral that supports the proper function of your thyroid gland.
Your thyroid gland plays a critical role in producing hormones that regulate growth and metabolism throughout your life.
If you suspect you have  low iodine  or may be at risk of developing iodine deficiency, consult a healthcare professional to determine whether an iodine supplement is right for you.
There are countless supplement options available. When choosing one that is best for you, be sure to consider the price, ingredient content, dosage, and overall quality before purchasing.
