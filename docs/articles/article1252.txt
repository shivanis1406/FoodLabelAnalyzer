Title: 8 Herbs and Natural Supplements for Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)

Certain herbs and vitamins may help prevent UTIs and resolve uncomplicated infections. But if you have severe symptoms, you may need medical attention.
If you’re one of the many people in the world who experiences recurrent UTIs, you may be seeking natural and alternative solutions to avoid excessive exposure to antibiotic drugs.
Here are 8 herbs and natural supplements that may help prevent and treat mild UTIs.

1. D-mannose
D-mannose is a type of simple sugar. It occurs naturally in a variety of foods, including cranberries, apples, and oranges, but is usually consumed in powder or tablet form when used as a UTI therapy.
Not much is known about how  D-mannose  works, but many experts believe it inhibits the ability of certain infectious bacteria to adhere to the cells of your urinary tract, making it easier for them to be flushed out before they can make you sick.
More research is needed to determine whether D-mannose can reliably treat or exert preventive effects against UTIs. However, a few small studies have delivered some promising results.
One  2016 study  evaluated the effect of D-mannose on 43 women with active UTIs and a history of  recurrent UTIs .
For the first 3 days, participants took a 1.5-gram dose of D-mannose twice daily, followed by one daily 1.5-gram dose for 10 additional days. After 15 days, approximately 90% of their infections had resolved.
Although these results are encouraging, the study design was somewhat flawed due to the small sample size and lack of a control group.
A  2013 study  of 308 women compared the effectiveness of a daily 2-gram dose of D-mannose and a common antibiotic used to prevent UTI recurrence.
After 6 months, results revealed that D-mannose was as effective as the antibiotic at preventing UTI recurrence, and it was associated with fewer side effects.
For most people, taking D-mannose doesn’t pose any major health risks. The most frequently reported side effect is mild  diarrhea .
However, because D-mannose is a type of sugar, it may not be appropriate for people with challenges regulating blood sugar levels.
There’s not currently enough evidence to establish an ideal dose of D-mannose, but most available research has safely tested doses of 1.5–2 grams up to 3 times daily.

2. Uva ursi (bearberry leaf)
Uva ursi — otherwise known as  Arctostaphylos uva ursi  or bearberry leaf — is an herbal remedy for UTIs that has been used in traditional and folk medicine practices for centuries.
It’s derived from a type of wild, flowering shrub that grows across various parts of Europe, Asia, and North America.
The plant’s berries are a favorite snack for bears — hence the nickname bearberry leaf — while its leaves are used to make herbal medicine.
After the leaves are harvested, they may be dried and steeped to make tea. Leaf extracts may be consumed in capsule or tablet form.
Modern research supporting the use of uva ursi to treat UTIs is limited, though several compounds present in the plant have exhibited potent antimicrobial capabilities in test-tube studies.
Arbutin is the main compound credited with uva ursi’s UTI-healing potential . Its antibacterial effect on  E. coli  — one of the most common causes of UTIs — makes it ideal for treating  UTIs.
One older study  of 57 women found that supplemental use of uva ursi with  dandelion  root significantly reduced UTI recurrence compared with a placebo.
However, a  2019 study  of over 300 women observed no difference between uva ursi and placebo when they were used as a treatment for active UTIs.
Available research suggests uva ursi is relatively safe at daily doses of 200–840 mg of hydroquinone derivatives calculated as anhydrous arbutin.
However, its long-term safety has not been established, and it should not be taken for longer than  1–2 weeks  at a time due to the potential risk of liver and kidney damage.

3. Garlic
Garlic is a popular herb that has been widely used in both culinary and traditional medicine practices throughout history. It’s often used to treat a broad range of physical ailments, including fungal, viral, and bacterial infections.
Garlic’s healing potential is usually attributed to the presence of a sulfur-containing compound known as allicin.
In  test-tube studies , allicin exhibits strong antibacterial effects against a variety of infectious, UTI-causing bacteria — including  E. coli .
Additional evidence from individual  case reports  suggests that  garlic  may be an alternative therapy for treating UTIs in humans, but strong research to validate these results is lacking.
Ultimately, more well-designed studies are needed to better understand the role garlic may play in treating and preventing recurrent UTIs before any definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding its effectiveness or ideal dosage.
Garlic can be consumed in its whole, raw form, but supplemental doses are usually sold as extracts and consumed in capsules.
Garlic supplements are likely safe for most people, but side effects may include heartburn and body odor.
Some people may experience allergic reactions to garlic supplements. Avoid using garlic if you have a history of allergies to garlic or other closely related plants, such as onions or leeks.
These supplements  may increase  your risk of bleeding and can interact with some medications, such as blood thinners and certain HIV drugs.

4. Cranberry
Cranberry products, including  juices  and extracts, are among the most popular choices for natural and alternative treatments for UTIs.
Cranberries contain a wide variety of chemical compounds, such as D-mannose, hippuric acid, and anthocyanins, that may play a role in limiting the ability of infectious bacteria to adhere to the urinary tract, thus hindering their growth and ability to cause infection.
Test-tube and animal  studies  have demonstrated that cranberry prevents UTIs, but human research has found considerably less convincing results.
A  2012 review  of human studies on cranberry products’ ability to treat and prevent UTIs concluded there was insufficient evidence to determine that cranberry exerts these effects.
However, the authors of the study noted that drawing definitive conclusions was difficult, as many of the studies were poorly designed, lacked a standard dosage, and used various cranberry products.
Another  2019 review  suggested that although cranberry treatment may help reduce UTI occurrence and UTI symptoms in some cases, it’s not as effective as other treatment methods, such as D-mannose and the antibiotic fosfomycin.
Cranberry juices and  supplements  are safe for most people, but they may cause an upset stomach. Plus, long-term use may increase your risk of developing  kidney stones .
Large doses of cranberry supplements may also interfere with certain types of blood-thinning medications.

5. Green tea
Green tea is derived from the leaves of  Camellia sinensis . For centuries, it has been used for its broad pharmacological potential in a variety of traditional medicine practices.
Green tea contains a rich supply of plant compounds called polyphenols, which are well known for having strong antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects.
Epigallocatechin (EGC), a compound in green tea, has demonstrated potent antibacterial effects against UTI-causing strains of  E. coli  in test-tube research.
Several animal  studies  have also found that  green tea  extracts containing EGC may improve the effectiveness of certain types of antibiotics frequently used to treat UTIs.
Still, human studies evaluating green tea’s ability to treat and prevent UTIs are lacking.
A single cup (240 mL) of brewed green tea contains approximately 150 mg of EGC. The current research indicates that as little as 3–5 mg of EGC may be enough to help inhibit bacterial growth in the urinary tract, but this theory hasn’t yet been proven in humans.
A  moderate intake  of green tea is safe for most people. However, it naturally contains caffeine, which may contribute to impaired sleep and restlessness.
Moreover, consuming caffeine while you have an active UTI may worsen your physical symptoms. Thus, you may want to opt for decaffeinated green tea products instead.
High dose green tea extract supplements  have been linked  to liver injury, but it’s unclear whether the supplements were the underlying cause.

Other potential remedies
Several types of  herbal teas  may be used to treat and prevent UTIs, but despite their popularity, very few studies have been conducted on their use for this purpose.
Parsley has a mild diuretic effect, which is supposed to help flush UTI-causing bacteria out of the urinary tract.
Two  case  reports  found that a combination of  parsley tea , garlic, and cranberry extract prevented UTI recurrence in women with chronic UTIs.
However, more research is needed to determine whether these results can be replicated in larger groups.
Chamomile tea is used in herbal medicine practices to treat a wide range of physical ailments, including UTIs.
Like parsley,  chamomile  possesses a weak diuretic effect and contains plant compounds with anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties.
These features are thought to help reduce inflammation, inhibit bacterial growth, and flush the urinary tract of infectious bacteria, but more research is needed.
Teas made from  peppermint  and other types of wild mint are also sometimes used as a natural remedy for UTIs.
Some test-tube  research  has found that mint leaves have antibacterial effects against various UTI-causing bacteria, such as  E. coli . Certain compounds found in mint leaves may also help reduce bacterial resistance to antibiotic medications.
However, no studies currently support the use of mint tea to fight UTIs in humans.

The bottom line
Attempting to diagnose and treat yourself for a UTI without the guidance of a medical professional is not recommended.
Instead, communicate openly and let your healthcare professional know if you’re interested in trying herbal alternatives instead of antibiotics.
They will be able to help you create the safest, most effective treatment plan.
Although research on their effectiveness is limited, D-mannose, uva ursi, cranberry, garlic, and green tea are popular choices for natural UTI treatment and prevention. Certain herbal teas may also help.
Given that herbal and nutritional supplements are generally not regulated in many countries, always choose brands that have been independently tested by a third party, such as NSF International.
