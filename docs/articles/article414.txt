BOTTOM LINE:  The GOLO Diet focuses on managing insulin levels through supplements, diet, and exercise to promote weight loss. It may be effective, but some people may find it pricey and challenging. And research on its potential benefits is limited.

What is the GOLO Diet?
The GOLO Diet focuses on  managing insulin levels  to help promote weight loss.
According to the  diet’s website , the team of developers, which includes doctors, pharmacists, and researchers, designed the diet to help balance hormone levels, increase metabolism, and support steady and  sustainable weight loss .
The idea is based on studies that have shown that a  low glycemic diet  — comprised mostly of foods that don’t spike blood sugar or insulin levels — can help with weight management, fat burning, and metabolism ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
The creators of the GOLO Diet promise that you can eat 20–30% more food than on conventional weight loss diets by increasing your metabolism and focusing on healthier choices rather than counting calories or restricting intake.
The plan also promotes a supplement called GOLO Release, which contains an array of plant extracts and minerals that supposedly help regulate blood sugar levels, increase energy, and reduce hunger and cravings.
Each purchase also includes the GOLO Rescue Plan, a guidebook that teaches you how to create balanced, nutrient-dense meals with the foods you love — based on your personal metabolic rate.
Membership also gives you access to an online community, which includes free meal plans, health assessments, support from online coaches, and discounted products.
The GOLO Diet is focused on balancing hormone levels and managing insulin to support weight loss. Its three main components are the GOLO Release supplement, a guidebook, and an online community.

Can it help you lose weight?
The GOLO Diet encourages eating healthy whole foods and increasing  exercise  — which can theoretically aid weight loss.
Several studies — funded and conducted by the makers of the GOLO Diet — evaluate its effectiveness and are accessible on the company’s website.
One 26-week study involving 35 people diagnosed as being overweight and having obesity showed that combining an exercise regimen with the GOLO Release supplement and diet and behavioral changes resulted in an average weight loss of 31 pounds (14 kg) ( 5 ).
Another study in 21 people found that those who combined diet and exercise with GOLO Release lost a total of 53 pounds (24 kg) over 25 weeks — or about 32.5 pounds (15 kg) more than the control group that didn’t take GOLO Release ( 6 ).
In addition, GOLO has funded some studies that are published in allegedly peer-reviewed journals. As they don’t provide any information on what their peer review process looks like, they appear to be of questionable quality and may have a high risk for bias ( 7 ,  8 ).
Additionally, it’s unclear whether the GOLO program and supplements specifically cause weight loss or simply the combination of diet, exercise, and behavioral modifications results in weight loss.
Therefore, while the GOLO Diet may help those who want to lose weight by promoting  healthy diet  and lifestyle changes, more research is needed to determine whether it’s more effective than other regimens.
Several company-funded and -conducted studies have shown that the GOLO Diet may aid weight loss. Yet, it’s unclear whether the program specifically causes this, or weight loss is the result of merely reducing food intake and increasing exercise.

Benefits of the GOLO Diet
The GOLO Diet is based on several solid nutrition principles, such as increasing exercise and eliminating processed foods — both of which may promote  weight loss  and improve blood sugar levels.
In fact, multiple studies indicate that regular exercise can  reduce blood sugar  levels in people with and without diabetes ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ).
Additionally, one analysis of 98 ready-to-eat foods found that minimally processed foods were more filling and raised blood sugar less than ultra-processed products ( 12 ).
The GOLO Diet also encourages nutrient-rich whole foods like fruits, veggies, healthy fats, and lean proteins. This makes it easier to get all of the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants your body needs.
What’s more, the diet may be a good option if your knowledge of nutrition is limited, as it makes it easy to create balanced, well-rounded meals by simply combining 1–2 portions of carbs, proteins, fats, and veggies per meal.
The GOLO Diet is based on solid nutrition principles and may aid weight loss and blood sugar management. It also encourages nutrient-rich foods and makes it easy to create balanced meals by combining food groups.

Potential downsides
The GOLO Diet can be expensive to follow. For example, GOLO Release costs $49.95 for 90 tablets, which can last 1–3 months depending on how many you take per day.
While the manufacturer states that GOLO Release contains no caffeine or other stimulants, like all supplements, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate it in the same way as pharmaceuticals. So talk with your doctor before taking.
Though it contains several plant extracts claimed to  support metabolism , it also includes micronutrients that can easily be obtained by following a nutritious diet or taking a basic multivitamin that includes zinc, chromium, and magnesium.
In addition, while some people may find it easy to create nutrient-dense meals using the diet’s principles, others may find it challenging and restrictive due to its strict rules about which foods and  portion sizes  are allowed at each meal.
The multitude of variations of the diet and the many factors that need to be taken into account — such as fit points, fuel values, and personal metabolic rates — can also make it unnecessarily confusing for consumers.
Lastly, unbiased research on the GOLO Diet is lacking — as the only available studies are directly funded and conducted by its creators.
Therefore, it’s unclear whether the diet has any added benefits aside from merely encouraging a nutrient-dense, well-rounded diet and regular exercise.
The GOLO Diet can be expensive, confusing, and difficult to follow. Additionally, given the lack of research available, it’s unclear whether it has any additional benefits over regular diet and exercise.

Foods to eat
One of the main components of the GOLO Diet is the GOLO Metabolic Fuel Matrix, which allows you to make selections from four “fuel groups” —  proteins , carbs, vegetables, and fats.
You should eat 3 meals per day and are allotted 1–2 standard servings of each fuel group per meal.
Serving sizes vary greatly, ranging from one tablespoon (15 mL) of olive oil to three ounces (85 grams) of white meat or fish, for example.
Exercising earns you additional fit points, allowing you to consume extra snacks or portions throughout the day.
Here are some of the foods you’re encouraged to eat:
Protein:   eggs , meat, poultry, seafood, nuts, dairy products
Carbs:  berries, fruit, yams, butternut squash, sweet potatoes, white potatoes, beans, whole grains
Vegetables:  spinach, kale, arugula, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, celery,  cucumbers , zucchini
Fats:  olive oil, coconut oil, nuts, chia seeds, hemp seeds,  flaxseeds , GOLO salad dressing
The GOLO Diet allows you to include 1–2 portions of protein, carbs, vegetables, and fats per meal.

Foods to avoid
The GOLO Diet discourages processed and refined foods and focuses on healthy whole foods instead.
Short-term versions of the diet, such as “7 Day Kickstart” or “Reset 7,” are advertised as quick and easy ways to eliminate toxins before transitioning to a regular GOLO eating plan.
For these specific plans, foods like red meat,  dairy products , and grains should be eliminated altogether.
However, they can later be re-introduced and enjoyed in moderation as part of the regular GOLO Diet.
Here are some of the foods that you should avoid on the GOLO Diet:
Processed foods:  potato chips, crackers, cookies, baked goods
Red meat:  fatty cuts of beef, lamb, pork (for short-term diets only)
Sugar-sweetened beverages:  soda, sports drinks, sweetened teas,  vitamin waters , and juices
Artificial sweeteners:  aspartame, sucralose, saccharin
The GOLO Diet encourages whole foods and discourages processed foods, sugar-sweetened beverages, and artificial sweeteners.

The bottom line
The GOLO Diet focuses on managing  hormone levels  through supplements, exercise, and a nutrient-dense diet to promote weight loss.
It may help you manage your weight, lower blood sugar levels, and improve your health.
Yet, for some, it may be pricey and challenging. It also needs to be more thoroughly researched to determine its effectiveness.
