This article reviews popcorn’s nutrition facts and health effects, both good and bad.

What is popcorn?
Popcorn is a special type of corn that “pops” when exposed to heat.
At the center of each kernel is a small amount of water, which expands when heated and eventually causes the kernel to explode.
The oldest piece of popcorn was discovered in New Mexico and is said to be over 5,000 years old.
Over the years, it has become increasingly popular. It became especially popular during the Great Depression because it was so cheap.
Today around 1.2 billion pounds (500 million kg) are consumed by Americans every year, making it America’s most popular snack food by volume ( 1 ).

Popcorn nutrition facts
Many people don’t realize it, but popcorn is a  whole grain food , making it naturally high in several important nutrients.
Many studies link whole grain consumption to health benefits like  reduced inflammation  and a decreased risk of heart disease ( 2 ,  3 ).
This is the nutrient content of a 28.35-gram (1-oz) serving of air-popped popcorn ( 4 ,  5 ):
Vitamin B1 (Thiamin):  0.029 mg
Vitamin B3 (Niacin):  0.655 mg
Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine):  0.045 mg
Iron:  0.904 mg
Magnesium:  40.8 mg
Phosphorus:  101 mg
Potassium:  93.3 mg
Zinc:  0.873 mg
Copper:  0.074 mg
Manganese:  0.315 mg
This is coming with a total of 110 calories, 3.36 grams of protein, 22.1 grams of carbs and 1.29 grams of fat.
This serving also contains a whopping 4.11 grams of fiber, which is extremely high. It makes it one of the world’s  best sources of fiber .
Popcorn is a whole grain food that is high in important nutrients. This includes vitamins, minerals and very high amounts of fiber.

It is high in polyphenol antioxidants
Polyphenols are antioxidants that help protect our cells from damage by free radicals.
A 2019 study showed that popcorn contains very large amounts of polyphenols ( 6 ).
Polyphenol are linked to various health benefits. This includes better blood circulation, improved digestive health and a reduced risk of many diseases including hypertension and diabetes ( 7 ,  8 ).
Several studies have also shown that polyphenols may reduce the risk of cancer, including prostate and breast cancer ( 9 ,  10 ).
Popcorn contains large amounts of polyphenol antioxidants. These are plant compounds that have been linked to many health benefits.

Extremely high in fiber
Popcorn is very high in fiber.
According to research, dietary fiber may reduce the risk of many diseases like heart disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes ( 11 ,  12 ,  13 ).
Fiber can also help with weight loss and promote digestive health ( 14 ,  15 ,  16 ).
The recommended daily intake of fiber is 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men. However, most people are eating much less than that ( 17 ).
100 grams (3.5 ounces) of popcorn contain 15 grams of fiber, which goes a long way towards satisfying your daily fiber requirements ( 4 ,  5 ).
Popcorn is very high in fiber, which has been linked to several health benefits. This includes weight loss and a decreased risk of many diseases.

Eating it may help with weight loss
Popcorn is high in fiber, relatively low in calories and has a low energy density. These are all characteristics of a  weight loss friendly food .
With 31 calories per cup, air-popped popcorn contains much fewer calories than many popular snack foods ( 4 ).
One study compared feelings of fullness after eating popcorn and potato chips. They found that 15 calories of popcorn were as filling as 150 calories of potato chips ( 18 ).
Because of its low calorie content, low energy density, high fiber content and increased satiety, eating popcorn may help you eat fewer calories and lose weight.
However, moderation is key. Even though it is much more filling than many other  snack foods , it can still be fattening if you eat too much of it.
Popcorn is high in fiber, relatively low in calories and has a low energy density. Eating it in moderation may help with weight loss.

Pre-packaged microwave popcorn may be harmful
There are many ways to enjoy popcorn, but the most convenient and most popular tends to be the pre-packaged microwave variety.
Most microwave bags are lined with a chemical called perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which has been associated with a variety of health problems.
These include  ADHD , low birth weight and thyroid problems, to name a few ( 19 ,  20 ,  21 ).
Microwave popcorn may also contain diacetyl, which is a chemical found in artificial butter flavoring.
Although the risk to the general public has not been clearly identified, animal studies continue to show that breathing in diacetyl can damage airways and cause lung diseases ( 22 ,  23 ,  24 ).
Many brands of microwave popcorn are made using hydrogenated oils, which may still contain traces of harmful partially hydrogenated oils or  trans fats .
Studies have linked trans fats to an increased risk of heart disease and other serious diseases, which is why they are no longer allowed to be sold in foods sold in the US ( 25 ,  26 ,  27 ,  28 ).
Even if certain brands say they are free of these chemicals, you may still want to avoid them since it’s so easy to make your own healthy popcorn.
Pre-packaged microwave popcorn often contains PFOA and diacetyl, chemicals that may be harmful. It may also contain traces of trans fats.

Some toppings and preparation methods are a bad idea
Despite all of popcorn’s healthy qualities, the way it is prepared can greatly impact its nutritional quality.
When air-popped, it is naturally low in calories, but some ready-made types are extremely high in calories.
For example, a report by CSPI found that a medium-sized popcorn at a popular movie theater chain had a whopping 1,200 calories – even before factoring in the buttery topping ( 29 ).
Varieties bought from movie theaters or stores are often smothered in unhealthy fats, artificial flavorings and  high amounts of sugar  and salt.
These ingredients not only add a significant amount of calories, but some of them can also be bad for you in other ways.
Commercially prepared popcorn varieties can be extremely high in calories and unhealthy ingredients.

You can add additional flavor by topping it with fresh  herbs or spices . If you want something sweet, try drizzling it with natural nut butter or sprinkling it  with cinnamon  or shavings of  dark chocolate .
For an added health benefit, sprinkle it with nutritional yeast. Nutritional yeast has a nutty-cheesy flavor and contains several important nutrients, including protein, fiber, B-vitamins and several minerals ( 30 ).
