Title: Can You Freeze Avocado, and Should You?

Avocado is a delicious and popular fruit that’s rich in healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals.
When avocados are in season or on sale, it’s tempting to stock up. However, ripe ones spoil quickly, turning brown and mushy.
To keep ripe avocados longer, you can try freezing them. However, freezing has some negative effects on the fruit’s quality.
This article explains the effects of freezing avocados and how best to do it.

Effects of freezing avocados
When freezing avocados, it’s important to consider the effects on the nutrient content, texture, color, and flavor.
Avocados are rich in nutrients, including  healthy fats  and fiber, as well as copper, potassium, folate,  niacin , and vitamins B6, C, E, and K ( 1 ).
Freezing itself does not significantly affect the calorie, fiber, or mineral content of foods, but it may reduce their levels of  water-soluble vitamins , such as vitamin B6 and folate ( 2 ,  3 ).
No research has analyzed exactly how much nutrient loss occurs from freezing avocados, but you should expect some losses — particularly in cases of extended storage times ( 2 ,  4 ).
Yet, nutrients also decline over time in fresh produce. Thus, the nutrient losses from freezing shouldn’t be a significant concern ( 2 ).
Freezing avocado impairs its signature smooth, creamy texture.
When frozen, the fruit’s water expands and disrupts its structure — an effect also seen in other frozen fruits, such as  papaya  ( 5 ).
After being thawed, the avocado becomes slimy, watery, and mushy.
While you may not want to eat it on its own, you can remedy this unpleasant texture by blending it into your smoothie or puréeing it to make guacamole or  salad dressing .
Avocados brown when exposed to oxygen in the air ( 6 ).
When frozen, they’re often puréed or cut into halves or chunks, thus exposing them to air during both freezing and thawing. Thawed avocado may  rapidly brown , so correct preparation and storage methods are essential.
While browning is a natural process and doesn’t necessarily affect the taste, some people may find it unappealing.
To reduce browning, you can brush small amounts of lemon juice or  vinegar  onto the flesh before freezing. Commercial preparations of frozen avocado usually add ascorbic or citric acid ( 7 ).
Additionally, you should make sure to seal the fruit completely. If improperly protected, it may experience freezer burn, which can cause discoloration and drying.
Although freezing itself doesn’t significantly affect flavor, various processing methods might.
If you use vinegar or lemon juice to prevent browning, they may change the taste slightly. Yet, these flavors won’t be as pronounced if you’re mixing the avocado into a dip like guacamole.
Commercially frozen avocado products may contain additives and other ingredients, so you should  check the label  if you’re concerned about taste.
Freezing avocados generally has little effect on nutrient content but can result in a mushy texture, browning, and changes in flavor due to additives.

How to freeze avocados
Whole avocados tend to become brown and very mushy upon thawing. As such, you should cut, mash, or purée the fruit before freezing.
Frozen avocado has a shelf life of 4–6 months, but commercial products may last even longer due to  added preservatives  ( 8 ).
Start by cutting a ripe avocado in half, then removing the pit and peeling it. If desired, you can cut it into smaller chunks.
Brush or spray the exposed avocado flesh with a little  lemon juice  to help prevent browning, then wrap it in plastic wrap or place it in a resealable bag. If you have a vacuum sealer, you can use it instead.
It’s important to leave as little air as possible touching the flesh to prevent browning and freezer burn.
Label and date the avocado if you’d like, then freeze it at 0°F (-18°C).
You can likewise freeze mashed or puréed avocado — or even homemade guacamole.
After peeling and pitting, mash or purée the  fruit  by hand or using a food processor.
If making guacamole, add lemon or lime juice and any other seasonings — but avoid adding other vegetables like tomato or  onion  at this stage, as these tend to release water during thawing.
Place the purée in a container, ice cube tray, or resealable bag, pressing out as much air as possible — by hand or with a vacuum sealer. Label and date the bags and freeze at 0°F (-18°C).
Ripe avocado can be frozen mashed or puréed, as well as in halves or chunks, and kept for 4–6 months. Add lemon juice and seal the avocado tightly in plastic or with a vacuum sealer to minimize browning.

How to thaw and use frozen avocado
Once you’re ready to use your frozen avocado, remove it from the freezer and thaw it in the refrigerator or at room temperature. Thawing generally takes about 1 hour at room temperature.
Thawed avocado is most suitable for salad dressings, smoothies, and  other dishes  like guacamole, dips, and spreads. Many people find it unappealing to eat plain or in salads due to the changes in texture, but it’s perfectly safe to do so if you wish.
Seasonings  and extra ingredients may help mask the mushiness and other changes associated with freezing.
Frozen avocado should be thawed at room temperature for approximately 1 hour. It’s best used in multi-ingredient dishes, such as guacamole, dips, spreads, and smoothies.

The bottom line
Freezing avocado may help you  reduce food waste  and keep this fruit on hand throughout the year.
While most nutrients are preserved during  freezing , the flesh tends to become mushy and may brown during storage or thawing.
Therefore, frozen avocados are best mixed into dishes like guacamole, dips, and smoothies.
