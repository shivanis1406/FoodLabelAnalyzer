Title: How Many Calories Are in Your Favorite Sushi Rolls?

About 2-3 pieces of sushi typically contain 93-190 calories, but the calorie count varies based on the type of ingredients used.
Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that is popular in the United States and around the globe ( 1 ).
It is commonly served in a roll shape that contains 6–8 pieces of sushi, depending on the type. The dish features a variety of cooked and raw seafood, vegetables, and rice wrapped in sheets of dried seaweed called nori.
Although sushi rolls are relatively small and often thought of as a weight loss-friendly food, they can have more calories and sodium than you might think.
This article discusses how many calories are in popular sushi rolls, sashimi, and nigiri so you can choose which types, if any, suit your health goals.

Popular rolls

Because imitation crab is precooked, this roll is also a great option for those who want to try sushi but are wary of eating raw fish.

Ways to make sushi healthier
Traditional Japanese sushi dishes contain minimal ingredients and are generally low in calories.
However, popular westernized adaptations of sushi often have high fat ingredients and sauces that make them higher in calories.
Further, regardless of the type of sushi you choose, using lots of  soy sauce  for serving introduces high amounts of sodium. This can be a concern, especially for people with high blood pressure ( 16 ).
Here are some simple ways to make your next sushi night healthier:
Choose alternative grains.  Though these options are not as popular, some restaurants offer sushi made with brown rice or quinoa instead of white rice. This can boost the fiber and nutrition content of your meal.
Go rice-free.  Sashimi is a rice-free, low calorie option. If raw fish is not a deterrent for you, this may be the healthiest choice.
Get soy sauce on the side.  Soy sauce is high in sodium, and excess sodium intake in linked to high blood pressure and heart disease. Instead of covering your sushi in soy sauce, keep the sauce on the side and lightly dip for some flavor ( 16 ).
Choose low fat.  Tempura sushi and sushi made with mayonnaise and cream cheese are higher in calories. You can opt to have these less often than lower fat alternatives.
Focus on sides.  Sushi is often served with sides like pickled ginger, wasabi, miso soup, and edamame beans. Explore various tastes and textures with these sides, and don’t rely only on soy sauce for flavor.
Choose fresh whenever possible.  Freshly made sushi often has fewer ingredients than packaged sushi. For example, packaged types often contain additives to improve their quality and safety and prolong their shelf life.

The bottom line
Sushi is a popular Japanese dish made with raw and cooked seafood, vegetables, rice, and seaweed.
Although traditional Japanese sushi contains just a few ingredients and is low in calories, many adaptations of the dish contain high fat ingredients and are therefore higher in calories.
Per 100 grams of sushi — typically equaling 2 to 3 pieces — calories range from 93 to 190, with vegetarian, rice-free, and non-fried options being lower in calories.
In addition to considering the fat and calorie content, keep an eye on the sodium to make sure you keep your daily intake  within recommendations .
Try this today:  The next time you order sushi, keep soy sauce on the side and lightly dip your sushi pieces instead of drizzling with soy sauce. This can help reduce your sodium intake.
