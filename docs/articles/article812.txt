Title: 14 of the Most Filling Foods

Foods high in protein and fiber may leave you more sated, which means you feel full for longer. Some of the most filling foods include potatoes, oatmeal, eggs, fish, Greek yogurt, and popcorn. How you prepare them matters, though.
What you eat can determine how full you feel, as foods affect sensations of fullness differently.
Foods that are filling can ward off hunger and help you eat less at the next meal. For this reason, these types of foods should help you  manage your weight  in the long run.
This article lists 14 nutritious foods that are filling. But first, let’s look at the reasons why some foods are more filling than others.

What makes a food filling?
Filling foods tend to have the following characteristics:
High in protein:   Studies  show that  protein  is the most filling macronutrient. It changes the levels of several satiety hormones, including ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1).
High in fiber:  Fiber provides bulk and  helps you feel full  for longer. It may  slow stomach emptying  and increase digestion time.
High in volume:  Some foods contain a lot of water or air, which may help  promote satiety .
Low in energy density:  This means that a food is low in calories for its weight. Foods with a low energy density  are very filling . They typically contain a lot of water and fiber but are low in fat.
Whole, unprocessed foods are also generally more filling than processed foods and offer added health benefits.
Filling foods may have certain characteristics, such as being high in protein or fiber.

1. Boiled potatoes
Potatoes  have been demonized in the past, but they’re actually healthy and nutritious.
Cooked, unpeeled potatoes  are a good source of several vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C and potassium.
Potatoes are high in water and  carbs  and contain moderate amounts of fiber and protein. They also contain almost no fat.
Compared with other  high carb foods , potatoes are very filling.
One small study  of 14 people found that those who consumed a meal with meat, vegetables, and potatoes felt less hungry and more satisfied than those who ate the same meal with rice or pasta instead.
Some evidence  indicates that part of the reason why potatoes are so filling is their energy density. Potatoes have a higher water content and lower energy density compared with foods like rice or pasta.
Because of this, you can eat a larger amount of potatoes than pasta or rice for the same amount of carbohydrates. A large food volume increases gastric distension and stimulates the feeling of fullness after eating.
Boiled potatoes are very filling. They can help you eat fewer calories in total because of their lower energy density.

2. Eggs
Eggs are  incredibly healthy  and  nutrient-dense .
Most of the nutrients are found in the yolks, including the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, which may  benefit eye health .
Eggs  are a great source of high quality protein. A large egg contains around 6 grams (g) of protein, including all nine essential amino acids.
One study  found that people who consumed eggs and toast for breakfast experienced less hunger and ate fewer calories during their next meal than those who ate cereal with milk and juice.
Eggs are a nutritious, high protein food with a powerful impact on fullness. They may also help you eat less later in the day.

3. Oatmeal
Oats , eaten as oatmeal (porridge), are a popular breakfast choice.  Oatmeal  is fairly low in calories and a great source of fiber, particularly a soluble fiber called  beta glucan .
Oatmeal’s filling power comes from its high fiber content and ability to soak up water.
Soluble fiber, such as the beta glucan in oats, can  help you feel full  and delay stomach emptying.
Oatmeal is a very filling breakfast choice. It may help you feel full and delay stomach emptying.

4. Fish
Fish  is loaded with high quality protein. Fatty fish, such as salmon, is also rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential fats that must be obtained from food.
Fish is rich in protein, and fatty fish like salmon are rich in omega-3 fatty acids.

5. Soups
Liquids are often considered to be  less filling than solid foods , but more research is needed.
However, soups are a bit different.
In one  older study , volunteers consumed either a solid meal, chunky soup, or smooth soup that had been put through a food processor. Feelings of fullness and the rate at which the food left the stomach were then measured.
Interestingly, the smooth soup had the greatest impact on fullness and the slowest rate of stomach emptying, followed by the chunky soup.
Soups are very filling meals, despite being in liquid form. They may also stay in the stomach longer, thus prolonging feelings of fullness.

6. Meat
High protein foods  like lean meats are very  filling .
Increasing your intake of protein-rich foods like meat can be an easy way to help regulate your appetite.
In fact,  one study  found that eating a high protein meal had a significantly greater impact on hormones related to hunger and appetite than a high carb meal.
Meat is high in protein and very filling. Beef scored the second highest among the protein-rich foods on the satiety index.

7. Greek yogurt
Greek  yogurt  is very thick compared with regular yogurt and typically higher in protein, too.
Greek yogurt is a great breakfast option. It’s also a popular afternoon snack that can help fill you up until your next meal.
In one  2021 study , participants consumed various dairy products before eating pizza. Those who consumed Greek yogurt ate the least amount of pizza.
Greek yogurt is a popular, high protein breakfast and snack. It may increase the feeling of fullness and help you feel less hungry until your next meal.

8. Vegetables
Vegetables are incredibly nutritious. They’re loaded with all sorts of vitamins, minerals, and beneficial plant compounds.
Vegetables are also high volume, low calorie foods. They contain fiber and water, which add bulk to your meals and  help fill you up .
Moreover, vegetables take some time to chew and are very satisfying in that way.
Vegetables are rich in fiber and water, which may keep you full for longer.

9. Cottage cheese
Cottage cheese  is usually low in fat and carbs yet high in protein.
Its high protein content can help you feel full, even while consuming relatively few calories.
One  older study  found that cottage cheese’s filling effect was similar to that of eggs.
Cottage cheese is high in protein yet low in fat and calories. Its effect on fullness may be comparable to that of eggs.

10. Legumes
Legumes like  beans , peas, lentils, and peanuts have an impressive nutritional profile.
They’re loaded with fiber and plant-based protein, yet they have a relatively low energy density. This makes them  very filling .
One  older article  reviewed nine randomized trials that studied post-meal fullness from pulses, which are a part of the legume family.
They found that participants felt 31% more full from eating pulses compared with eating meals without pulses that contained the same amount of calories.
Legumes are a good source of fiber and protein. They may help you feel full compared with other foods.

11. Fruit
Fruit has a low energy density. It also contains lots of fiber, which may slow digestion and help you feel full for longer.
However, it’s important to note that  whole fruit is more filling than juice , which has had most of its fiber removed.
Fruit is high in fiber and provides bulk that may help you feel full for longer. Whole fruit has a stronger effect on fullness than fruit juice.

12. Quinoa
While  quinoa  is technically a seed, it is included in the grains group because its nutritional properties are more similar to grains than seeds. Regardless, it’s a  good source of protein .
In fact, it  provides all the essential amino acids  and is therefore considered a complete protein source.
Quinoa is also  higher in fiber  than some grains.
The protein and fiber content of quinoa may  increase feelings of fullness  and help you eat fewer calories overall.
Quinoa is a good source of both protein and fiber, which may help increase feelings of fullness.

13. Nuts
Nuts like  almonds  and  walnuts  are energy-dense, nutrient-rich snack options.
They’re high in healthy fats and protein, and  studies  show that they’re very filling.
Other research has highlighted the importance of chewing nuts properly.
Nuts are a popular snack choice. They’re rich in healthy fats and also contain some protein. They’re also very filling.

14. Popcorn
Popcorn  is a whole grain food that’s very high in fiber, with  over 1 g of fiber  in every cup (8 g).
Several factors may contribute to its filling effects, including its  high fiber content  and  low energy density .
However, note that the popcorn you prepare yourself in a pot or air-popper machine is the lower-calorie option. Adding a lot of fat to the popcorn can increase the calorie content significantly.
Popcorn is a popular snack that’s high in fiber and volume but low in energy density. It’s very filling.

The takeaway
Filling foods possess certain qualities, such as the tendency to be high in fiber or protein and have a low energy density.
Additionally, these foods tend to be whole, single-ingredient foods — not highly processed foods.
Focusing on whole foods that fill you up with fewer calories may help you lose weight in the long run.
