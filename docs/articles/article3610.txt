Title: Plantains vs. Bananas: What’s the Difference?

While their nutritional content is similar, plantains are more starchy and contain less sugar than bananas. You can use plantains in more savory dishes.
Bananas are a staple in many household fruit baskets. Plantains, though, are not as well known.
It’s easy to confuse a plantain with a banana because they look so much alike.
However, if you were to substitute a plantain for a banana in a recipe, you may be surprised by its very different taste.
This article will review the similarities and differences between bananas and plantains, including some of their most common culinary uses.
Bananas and plantains are similar, but they have a few key differences in flavor and usage.
“Banana” is a term used for the edible fruits produced by various large, herbaceous plants in the genus  Musa . Botanically speaking,  bananas  are a type of berry ( 1 ).
Bananas are originally from Malay Archipelago in Southeast Asia. Bananas typically have a long, slender shape and are covered by a thick skin.
Many different kinds of bananas exist. However, in Western cultures, the term “banana” usually refers to the sweet, yellow variety.
The outer skin is green, tough, and difficult to peel when unripe.
As the banana ripens, the skin changes to bright yellow, followed by a dark brown. It also becomes progressively easier to peel.
Bananas can be eaten raw, and their edible flesh becomes sweeter, darker, and softer as it ripens. They can also be enjoyed cooked when ripe, often in desserts. When green, they can be boiled and mashed and eaten as you would mashed potatoes.
Plantains and bananas are genetically similar, but plantains are primarily eaten cooked.
Like bananas, plantains are originally from Southeast Asia. However, they are now grown all over the world, including in India, Egypt, Indonesia, and tropical regions of the Americas.
Plantains are usually larger and tougher than bananas, with much thicker skin. They may be green, yellow, or very dark brown.
Plantains are starchier than bananas and not very sweet when green. When ripe, they are sweeter and become more so when cooked. Plantains can be boiled, baked, or fried.
Bananas and plantains are both fruits that come from the same family of plants. Though they look alike, they have very different flavor profiles.

They have a lot in common
Aside from their botanical classifications, one of the most obvious similarities between plantains and bananas is their appearance.
But their commonalities don’t end there. In fact, they share some nutritional and health-promoting qualities too.
Both plantains and bananas are a good source of several vital nutrients, including  potassium , magnesium, vitamin C, fiber, and antioxidant compounds ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
Below is nutritional info for 100 grams (roughly 1/2 cup) of bananas and plantains:
They are both healthy sources of complex carbohydrates. Plantains contain roughly 32 grams of carbs per 100-gram serving, while bananas contain about 23 grams. However, this amount can vary, depending on the ripeness of the fruit ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
The main difference is that more of the carbs in bananas come from sugars, whereas more of the carbs in plantains are from starch.
They contain a similar number of calories: 89–122 calories per 100-gram serving. Neither is a significant source of fat or protein ( 2 ,  3 ).
Because bananas and plantains have similar nutritional composition, they may provide some of the same health benefits.
Some research indicates that the bioactive compounds in plantains and bananas may have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects ( 5 ).
Both fruits contain high levels of potassium, a mineral many people don’t get enough of. Adequate potassium intake may help lower blood pressure and reduce heart disease risk ( 6 ,  7 ).
Both fruits may also play a role in promoting digestive health because of their  fiber content  ( 8 ).
Additionally, both plantains and bananas contain high amounts of  resistant starch , which plays a role in promoting digestive health. It can also improve blood sugar management and insulin sensitivity ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 )
Bananas and plantains are very similar in their nutritional content, containing a variety of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. They also share potential health benefits.

Their culinary uses are similar
The main difference between bananas and plantains is how they’re used in the kitchen, though in some cultures there is not a clear linguistic distinction between the two.
A plantain is sometimes referred to as a “cooking banana,” while the sweeter variety is classified as a “dessert banana.”
Because ripe bananas are sweet, they are often used in cooked desserts and baked goods, including pies, muffins, and quick breads.
They’re also eaten raw by themselves, as part of a fruit salad, or as a dessert or porridge topping. They may even be dipped in  chocolate  or spread on toast with nut butter.
Green bananas can be enjoyed  when boiled  until soft. They are enjoyable when mashed as you would potatoes.
Plantains are more common in dishes in Central and South America and the Caribbean. They can also be found in the cuisine of African countries such as Ghana and Nigeria.
Mofongo is a popular Puerto Rican dish that is made with mashed plantains as the main ingredient. In Caribbean countries such as Jamaica, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic, you can find ripe plantains fried and served along with a meal.
They are starchy and tough when green and raw but soften as they ripen. They have a much thicker skin than bananas.
Plantains have less sugar than bananas and are often served as a savory side dish or as part of a main dish.
Like bananas, they start green and progress to yellow and then a dark brown-black as they ripen. The darker they are, the sweeter they’ll be. Plantains can be eaten at any stage of ripening, but you’ll need a knife to peel them.
Green and yellow plantains are often sliced and fried, a popular dish in Latin American and Caribbean cuisines .  If sliced very thinly before frying, they can be eaten more like chips.
When green and fried in Spanish-speaking countries, they can be referred to as tostones and, when ripe, as maduros.
The biggest differences between bananas and plantains are their flavor profile, size, and skin thickness. Bananas are popular in North American cuisine, while plantains have been more common in countries in the Caribbean, Latin America, and Africa.

Which is healthier?
Neither the banana nor the plantain is superior to the other nutritionally, as they are both nutrient-rich foods.
However, cooking methods can affect the nutritional content of these fruits. This has less to do with the fruit itself and more to do with what you’re adding to it.
If you’re concerned about  blood sugar management , you’ll still want to monitor your portions of both foods because they contain carbohydrates that can increase blood sugar.
Keep in mind, though, that both plantains and bananas are whole foods that contain fiber. This may help reduce blood sugar increases in some people, especially compared to more refined, processed foods that don’t have fiber ( 12 ).
Both bananas and plantains are both very healthy fruits, but cooking method can play a role in either fruit’s effect on your health.

The bottom line
While it’s possible to confuse bananas with plantains because of the two fruits’ visual similarities, you’ll find it’s easy to tell them apart after tasting them.
Their nutritional content and potential health benefits are similar, as are some of their applications in the kitchen.
Plantains are starchy and contain less sugar than bananas. They work well in savory dishes, while bananas are easily used in desserts or on their own.
Both fruits are nutritious, whole foods and can be included as part of a  healthy diet .
