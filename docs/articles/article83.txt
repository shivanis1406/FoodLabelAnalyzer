Title: What's the Difference Between Starchy and Non-Starchy Vegetables?

Starchy and non-starchy vegetables have many important differences, but their key difference is their total starch content, which is very important in the context of your total diet.
Eating plenty of vegetables each day is important for good health.
Vegetables are nutritious and rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals. They also offer protection against a number of chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease.
There are two main categories of vegetables: starchy and non-starchy. Starchy types include potatoes, corn and beans, while non-starchy types include broccoli, tomatoes and zucchini.
The key distinction between the two lies in their total content of starch, a type of carbohydrate. However, these vegetables do have a number of other differences.
This article examines the benefits and key differences of starchy and non-starchy vegetables.

What are starchy and non-starchy vegetables?
Starch is the main type of carbohydrate in your diet.
It’s often referred to as a complex carb, as it is made up of a number of joined sugar molecules.
Starch can be found in a range of foods, including breads, cereals, noodles, pasta, as well as starchy vegetables.
However, most vegetables contain only small amounts of starch and are classified as non-starchy types.
Very generally speaking, cooked starchy vegetables, such as potatoes, pack about  13 grams  of carbs and  57 calories  per 1/2 cup (61 grams), whereas non-starchy types like broccoli contain about  6 grams  of carbs and  28 calories  in an equivalent portion.
US health agencies recommend eating  2.5 cups  of vegetables each day in a 2000-calorie diet — both starchy and non-starchy types.
Here are some common examples for each group:
Beans (kidney, navy, pinto, black, cannellini)
Butternut squash
Chickpeas
Corn
Lentils
Parsnips
Peas
Potatoes
Sweet potatoes
Taro
Yams
Artichokes
Asparagus
Bean sprouts
Brussels sprouts
Broccoli
Cabbage
Cauliflower
Celery
Cucumber
Eggplant (also known as aubergine)
Mushrooms
Onions
Peppers (also known as capsicum)
Salad greens
Spinach
Tomato
Turnips
Zucchini (also known as courgette)

Both are rich in nutrients
Both starchy and non-starchy vegetables boast an impressive nutrient profile.
While nutrient content varies depending on the type of vegetable and the cooking method, all types naturally contain a range of essential vitamins and minerals.
In fact, vegetables are some of the richest sources of  potassium , vitamin K, folate and magnesium. These nutrients are particularly important for bone health, heart health and a healthy pregnancy.
Vegetables also contain small amounts of other beneficial nutrients, including iron and zinc.
What’s more, they’re loaded with  antioxidants  — such as vitamins C and E — which are compounds that help protect cells from harmful damage caused by free radicals and oxidative stress.
As a result, antioxidants may  fight the aging process  and reduce your risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer and diabetes.
Vegetables also tend to be naturally low in sugar, fat and sodium — so you can eat a relatively large quantity without many adverse health effects.

Both are rich in fiber
Another shared feature of starchy and non-starchy vegetables is their high  fiber  content.
While fiber content varies according to type, most starchy vegetables are full of fiber. For instance, a medium baked russet potato with the skin contains about  4 grams  of fiber, or 14% of the DV.
Some starchy vegetables pack even higher amounts. For example, cooked chickpeas and lentils contain approximately  6 grams  to  8 grams  of fiber per 1/2 cup (82–99 grams), or 21–29% of the DV.
Similarly, non-starchy vegetables are also rich in fiber. For instance, cooked Brussels sprouts and broccoli contain  2 grams  to  3 grams  of fiber per 1/2 cup, or 7–10% of your daily needs.
Fiber can keep your bowel movements regular.  Studies  suggest it may also help prevent digestive conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, and  reduce cholesterol , blood sugar levels and your risk of heart disease and diabetes.
For these reasons, eating a range of starchy and non-starchy vegetables each day is a great way to meet your fiber needs and improve your digestive and overall health.

Starchy vegetables are higher in carbs and calories
Some types of starchy vegetables — including potato and corn — have caused controversy due to their high starch content.
Though some people believe they should be avoided altogether, starchy vegetables provide a range of beneficial nutrients and can make a healthy addition to your diet when consumed in moderation.
Compared to their non-starchy counterparts, starchy vegetables contain higher numbers of carbs and calories.
One big difference between starchy and non-starchy vegetables is their  carb  content.
Starchy vegetables pack around 2–3 times more carbs than non-starchy types, depending on the variety.
For instance, cooked butternut squash and potatoes contain between  11 grams  and  13 grams  of carbs in every 1/2 cup (61 grams for potatoes, 103 grams for squash), compared with  under 6 grams  in an equivalent amount of broccoli.
For this reason, if you have diabetes or follow a  low-carb diet , you may want to limit your intake of starchy vegetables.
That’s because they contain a similar number of carbs as bread, rice and cereals. Starchy vegetables can raise your blood sugar levels faster than non-starchy types.
However, many starchy vegetables rank low to medium on the glycemic index (GI). This is a measure of how much and how quickly a food raises blood sugar levels after being eaten.
Therefore, many starchy vegetables only produce a slow, low rise in blood sugar levels despite their carb content.
If consumed in moderation — in servings of about  1/2–1 cup  (70–180 grams) — starchy vegetables may be suitable for people who have diabetes or maintain a moderately low-carb diet.
Due to their high carb content, starchy vegetables also have more  calories  than non-starchy vegetables.
For example, butternut squash or potatoes provide  41 – 57  calories for each 1/2-cup serving, compared to  17 – 27  calories in the same amount of cooked cabbage or broccoli.
Therefore, be mindful of your portion size and cooking method when preparing and consuming starchy vegetables, especially if you’re trying to lose weight. The calories can quickly add up.
However, consuming 1/2–1 cup of boiled, roasted, baked or steamed starchy vegetables at each meal is unlikely to result in excess weight gain when incorporated into a healthy diet.

Starchy vegetables are a better source of resistant starch and protein
Starchy vegetables are also a great source of resistant starch and protein, both of which have a number of health benefits.
Starchy vegetables are especially rich in a type of starch known as resistant starch.
Resistant starch  acts in a similar way to soluble fiber. It passes through your digestive tract mainly unchanged, then is broken down by beneficial gut bacteria.
When your gut bacteria break down resistant starch, they produce  short-chain fatty acids  (SCFAs).
Resistant starch and SCFAs have a number of positive effects on your body. They  may soothe inflammation  in the gut and reduce blood sugar, weight and cholesterol.
A range of starchy vegetables, including beans, peas and corn, are particularly high in resistant starch.
In comparison, potatoes contain somewhat low amounts. However, this increases when potatoes are cooked through and left to cool — such as in a potato salad.
Lastly, some starchy vegetables — especially beans, chickpeas and lentils — are good sources of protein.
In fact, when cooked, they’re some of the best sources of  plant-based protein , as they contain up to  9 grams  of protein in a 1/2 cup, or 18% of the DV.
For this reason, beans, lentils and chickpeas make great substitutes for meat in  vegetarian and vegan  diets.
Their protein content  may promote  feelings of fullness, keeping your appetite and weight under control. It can also help build and preserve muscle mass and strength.

Non-starchy vegetables contain many nutrients but few calories
Non-starchy vegetables are very  low in calories , with most containing  less than 30  calories in a 1/2 cup.
For this reason, you can eat large portions of non-starchy vegetables without taking in enough calories to gain weight.
They’re also comprised of about 90% water, making them a good source of hydration in your diet. Therefore, non-starchy vegetables can help you meet your daily fluid needs.
Despite their low calorie content, non-starchy vegetables are high in fiber and contain essential vitamins and minerals. In fact, they have small amounts of almost all the vitamins and minerals you need.
Additionally, non-starchy vegetables are  low in carbs  — typically  around 5  grams of carbs in a 1/2 cup. As a result, they have little impact on blood sugar levels and are suitable for people following low-carb diets or who have diabetes.
It’s best to consume a variety of non-starchy and starchy vegetables throughout the day. They will add color, nutrients and flavor to your meals for very few calories.

Healthiest ways to eat them
In addition to their health benefits, starchy and non-starchy vegetables are delicious, versatile and easy to add to your diet.
Fresh and frozen  whole vegetables are generally considered the healthiest options, followed by juiced and canned varieties.
Bear in mind that juicing tends to reduce fiber content while canning often adds sugar and salt.
What’s more,  preparation and cooking methods  have a major impact on these vegetables’ nutritional quality.
Choose cooking methods like baking, boiling and steaming while limiting condiments such as rich sauces or creamy dressings, to avoid extra calories, salt and fat.
It’s also best to limit your consumption of fried and processed vegetable products — such as corn and potato chips — as these products can be high in calories, fat and salt.
For good health, eat at least  2.5 cups  of starchy and non-starchy vegetables each day to maximize your vitamin and nutrient intake.

The bottom line
Both starchy and non-starchy  vegetables  pack an impressive amount of vitamins, minerals and fiber.
Starchy vegetables have more carbs, calories, protein and resistant starch. They should be consumed in moderation — especially if you have diabetes, follow a low-carb diet or are trying to  lose weight .
Non-starchy vegetables are very low in calories while offering similar amounts of fiber and nutrients as starchy varieties.
Both starchy and non-starchy make delicious and nutritious additions to your diet as long as they’re prepared and cooked in healthy ways.
Aim to incorporate at least 2.5 cups of both types into your daily meals to make the most of the different nutritional qualities that each provides.
