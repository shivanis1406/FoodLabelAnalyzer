Title: Foods, Diets, and Tips to Follow for a Healthy Heart

Diets high in ultra-processed foods, sugars, and unhealthy fats can increase heart disease risk. Changing your diet can have a positive effect on your heart, even if you already have heart disease.
Your  heart  is a complex organ that works continuously to provide your body with a constant supply of oxygenated blood.
It’s part of the  cardiovascular system , which also includes arteries, veins, and capillaries.
Research suggests that diet may be the most preventive factor in heart disease-related death, which accounts for one-third of global mortality. Following a heart-healthy diet can significantly reduce your chance of developing heart disease and even heart disease-related death.
This article explains how diet impacts heart health and shares evidence-based ways to reduce heart disease risk and promote optimal cardiovascular health using simple, realistic dietary changes.

How your diet can affect your heart health
Your diet affects the health of every part of your body, including your heart.
After all, food  provides  the nutrients your body needs to function optimally, including  protein , carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals.
Heart disease risk factors  are categorized as modifiable or non-modifiable. Diet falls into the modifiable category because it’s something that you can change, unlike other risk factors like age or genetics.
Specifically, diet can help reduce the following risk factors for heart disease:
Blood pressure :  This can damage blood vessels and narrow arteries, which  increases  the strain on your heart. It can lead to an  enlarged heart  and increase the risk of  heart failure . Research shows that  a healthy diet  low in sugar, calories, and salt but high in nutritious foods like vegetables, nuts, olive oil, and fish is linked to a  44% lower risk  of high blood pressure.
Blood fat:  Elevated levels of blood lipids, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or “bad”) cholesterol and triglycerides, can lead to  atherosclerosis  and  increase your chance  of heart disease. Eating a diet  high in fiber-rich plant foods  and  low in added sugar  and processed foods can help reduce this risk.
Blood sugar and insulin:  High blood sugar and  insulin resistance  can lead to an accumulation of compounds called  advanced glycation end-products (AGEs)  and the creation of oxidative stress, which can damage the heart’s function. This can lead to diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD), which are  more likely  if you’re eating a diet of ultra-processed foods and added sugar.
Body weight:  The Western diet high in calorie-dense foods  can lead  to weight gain and heart issues like fibrosis, high blood pressure and lipids, and diabetes. As a result, obesity  increases  heart disease risk, but even just too much abdominal fat is a  risk factor  in itself.
Although studies often suggest that obesity is a risk factor for certain health conditions, they rarely account for the role  weight stigma  and discrimination play in health. Discrimination is one of the  social determinants of health  — the conditions in daily life that affect our health — and it can and does contribute to health inequities.
Meanwhile, experiences of weight stigma in daily life, inside and outside of medical settings,  are associated  with negative mental and physical health outcomes.
Everyone deserves appropriate and compassionate medical care. If you’re interested in finding weight-inclusive healthcare professionals, you may want to follow the work of the  Association for Size Diversity and Health , which is developing a directory that will launch in summer 2022.

Heart healthy diets
Through decades of research, scientists have narrowed down which  diets are most associated with a healthy heart  and low risk of cardiovascular disease.
The  Mediterranean diet  is perhaps the  most studied  diet when it comes to heart health.
It’s  generally high  in plant-based foods like beans, vegetables, fruits,  whole grains , seafood, and  healthy fats  like extra virgin olive oil and nuts, and low in ultra-processed foods, red and processed meats, and added sugar.
Some studies have found that adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet could decrease the risk of heart disease by as much as  40%.
Remember that choosing an eating pattern rooted in the principles of the Mediterranean diet  doesn’t have to mean giving up your cultural foods .
In fact, it’s important that your eating habits incorporate foods that are easy to access locally and meaningful to you culturally or personally.
For example, learn more about giving the Mediterranean diet a Caribbean twist  here .
Some plant-based diets of different types, including vegetarian, vegan, and  high-fiber diets , are  strongly associated with improved heart health  and decreased heart disease risk.
For example, a 2021 review of 10 studies involving 698,707 people found that people with the highest adherence to plant-based diets had a  16% lower risk  of heart disease.
That said, plant-based diets high in refined grains, sugar-sweetened beverages, and highly processed snacks  can still increase  the risk of heart disease.
Generally, diets that are most associated with improved heart health outcomes are high in plant foods like vegetables, fruits, beans, nuts, and seeds and low in ultra-processed foods, processed and red meats, and added sugar.
Here’s a 3-day heart-healthy meal plan to help get you started.
Keep in mind that this diet is not meant to treat pre-existing conditions that affect the heart, like heart failure.
If you have a heart condition and aren’t sure what to eat, talk with a healthcare professional. They can refer you to a registered dietitian who can give you specific dietary advice based on your health needs.
Breakfast : an egg omelet made with sautéed peppers,  kale , and  onions  served with sliced avocado and berries
Lunch : lentil soup served with a green  salad  with pumpkin seeds, feta cheese, cherry  tomatoes , olive oil, and balsamic vinaigrette
Dinner :  salmon  with pesto served with  broccoli  and roasted sweet potatoes
Snacks :  trail mix  made with almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, and dried cherries
Breakfast :  overnight oats  made with almond butter,  chia seeds , cashew milk, golden  raisins , and mixed berries
Lunch : Mediterranean  quinoa  salad with  arugula , chickpeas, sun-dried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, olives, and feta cheese with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette
Dinner : baked  chicken breast  with butternut squash and asparagus
Snacks : unsweetened Greek yogurt with diced apples, sliced almonds, and cinnamon
Breakfast :  shakshuka  — a Mediterranean-style breakfast made with eggs and tomatoes — served with a slice of  sprouted grain bread  topped with mashed avocado and chili flakes
Lunch : grilled  shrimp  and  pineapple  kabobs over a large green salad with an olive oil and herb vinaigrette
Dinner :  black bean burgers  served with cucumber and red onion salad and roasted herbed potato wedges
Snacks :  garlic  hummus with fresh vegetable sticks
Following a diet rich in nutrient-dense foods like the ones above while limiting foods and beverages associated with negative heart health outcomes can help keep your cardiovascular system healthy and reduce your risk of heart disease.

What to eat and avoid with a heart-healthy diet
Diets rich in vegetables and fruits have been consistently linked with improved heart health outcomes and reduced  heart disease risk factors  like high blood pressure and  diabetes .
Your diet as a whole matters most when it comes to disease prevention, but regularly consuming the following foods can benefit the health of your heart and promote overall wellness.
Fruits : All fruit benefits  heart health , but citrus fruits, apples, pears, and berries may be especially  cardioprotective.  Fruits  are high in fiber , vitamins, minerals, and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds like anthocyanins.
Vegetables :  Some studies  suggest that onions, garlic, cruciferous vegetables, leafy green vegetables, and carrots may have greater heart health benefits than other vegetables, though all vegetables  are heart-healthy .
Seafood : Seafood is high in nutrients like  omega-3 fats , which benefit cardiovascular health. A  2020 review  found that each 100-gram increase in fish consumption was associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease, heart attack, and heart failure.
Legumes : Beans and lentils are loaded with fiber and minerals like  magnesium  and  potassium , which are essential to cardiovascular health.  Some studies  show that legume-rich diets are associated with lower rates of heart disease. However, more research is needed.
Whole grains : Foods like quinoa,  brown rice , and oats are high in fiber and other nutrients associated with improved heart health. Replacing refined grains with whole grains  may help reduce  heart disease risk.
Healthy fats : Adding sources of healthy fats like olive oil, olives, nuts and seeds, fatty fish, and  avocado  to your diet may help improve heart health. Olive oil, an important part of Mediterranean-style diets, seems to be especially  cardioprotective .
Spices :  Research  shows that spices like turmeric, garlic,  saffron , and  ginger  have powerful anti-inflammatory effects and may help reduce heart disease risk factors.
Ultra-processed foods  are packed with  refined carbohydrates , added sugars,  saturated and trans fats , sodium, and potentially artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives.
These components are linked to an  increased risk  of heart problems. In fact, A 2021 study revealed that eating ultra-processed food was associated with  9% higher mortality  with each additional daily serving of ultra-processed food.
Generally, it’s a good idea to  avoid eating  the following processed foods:
High sodium foods
Fresh or frozen vegetables or meats with sauces or marinades
pre-made sauces or ready-to-eat rice or pasta
fatty meats or poultry with skin
butter, lard, or  coconut  and palm oil
sweetened snacks, desserts, or drinks
That said, the term “processed foods” includes various products, many of which are more convenient and less expensive than other foods. Not all foods that undergo processing are considered unhealthy or harmful. Learn more about  identifying healthy food vs junk food.
Even so, it’s a good idea to cook your own food as much as possible, as restaurant or pre-made foods are more likely to be processed and unhealthy for your heart.
But you don’t have to avoid eating out entirely. Just be conscious about what you choose to eat out of the house, and read labels carefully. Also, try to limit how much alcohol you consume to  two drinks or less a day  if you are male and one drink or less if you are female.
Learn  how to read food labels.
In this article, we use “male and female” to refer to someone’s sex as determined by their chromosomes and “men and women” when referring to their gender (unless quoting from sources using nonspecific language).
Sex is determined by chromosomes, and gender is a social construct that can vary between time periods and cultures. Both of these aspects are acknowledged to exist on a spectrum both historically and by modern scientific consensus.

Frequently asked questions
Any breakfast that excludes processed foods and includes plenty of healthy protein, fruit, and vegetables is good for your heart. For example, try eggs with  avocados  and berries or  oatmeal  with raisins and chia seeds.
The  3-day heart diet  claims that you can lose up to 10 pounds (4.5 kg) in just three days. However, it’s been criticized as too difficult to follow, ineffective, and potentially harmful to your health.
The  healthiest drinks for your heart  include water (either still or sparkling), unflavored cow or plant-based milk, tea, and  coffee .

The bottom line
Studies show that your diet can either increase or decrease your risk of developing heart disease.
While diets high in ultra-processed foods and added sugar have been associated with increased risk, dietary patterns high in fiber-rich plant foods like fruits and vegetables, fish, and healthy fats like olive oil can support heart health.
Whether you’re living with heart disease or simply trying to reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the future, making a few simple dietary changes can have a profound effect on your heart health.
