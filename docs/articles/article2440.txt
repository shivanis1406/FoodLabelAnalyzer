As you age, following a nutritious diet is essential for maintaining optimal health. However, many older adults may find it difficult to prepare nutrient-dense meals themselves, which can lead to poor calorie and nutrient intake.
Healthy meal delivery services may help. These companies deliver prepared meals or meal kits straight to your door. Here are seven of the best meal delivery services for seniors.

Best prepared meals for seniors
Some older adults may prefer convenient  premade meals that only require heating  before they’re ready to eat. The following companies offer tasty prepared meals that are ready in just a few minutes.


Best variety
Price per serving   $11.88–$14.67
Meals per week   6 or 12
Menus   High Protein, Low Carb, Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian, Vegan
Healthline score   3.6 out of 5
Snap Kitchen  offers fully prepared meals that are a great option for older adults. Registered dietitians review the service’s meals to ensure that each meal offers the necessary nutrients for optimal health.
Unlike some other meal delivery services, Snap Kitchen offers a variety of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options, so it’s easy to create a nutritionally complete menu. You can also add extras, such as hard-boiled eggs, oatmeal, soups, snacks, sides, and additional protein sources.
Each meal can be refrigerated for 4 to 6 days or frozen for future use. You can heat them in the microwave or oven after transferring them to an oven-safe dish. “I appreciated how quick and easy it was to prepare the meals,” says Healthline writer and registered dietitian  Lauren Manaker , who tested the service.
She did note that she found some of the meals a bit spicy, and wished they included more vegetables.
All Snap Kitchen meals are gluten-free, and you can filter menu items by ingredient, sodium content, protein amount, and more. The company offers Low Carb and High Protein menus that are suitable for older adults who have diabetes or  need more protein .
Once you decide how many weekly meals you want to receive (6 or 12), you can choose individual meals to include in your box.
It’s easy to change your order, and you can cancel your subscription anytime. Plus, you can choose a delivery day that works best for you.
For customers who live within 10 miles of a Snap Kitchen retail store, the company offers a Local Plan — you can choose a 3-, 5-, or 7-day meal plan and pick up your meals at your local Snap Kitchen store.
“Overall, I think Snap Kitchen is a convenient option for people who want to save time in the kitchen,” Manaker says.

Magic Kitchen  caters to older adults and is a great choice for those who want a variety of meal options. The company provides fully prepared frozen meals and offers two menus — A La Carte and Complete Meals.
The A La Carte menu lets you mix and match soups, main courses, side dishes, and desserts, while the Complete Meals menu provides full meals with entrees and side dishes packaged together. You can choose as many meals as you want.
Cooking may be challenging for seniors with medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease and heart failure, as well as those on dialysis, because of the dietary restrictions involved.
Notably, the Magic Kitchen menu accommodates specific diets, including low sodium, low carb, diabetes- and dialysis-friendly, vegetarian, and renal diets (for those with  kidney conditions ). Dietitians review each meal to ensure that it’s nutritionally complete.
The company offers a variety of meals, sides, and desserts, as well as options that serve just one person.
Most meals simply need to be heated in the microwave, but some — including the chicken pot pie — need to be cooked in an oven.

For the most part, meals are convenient and easy to prepare, according to 86-year-old Betty Boler, the grandmother of Healthline editor Kristin Currin-Sheehan. Boler takes coumadin and is on the  Warfarin diet , which limits vitamin K intake. She also manages  type 1 diabetes .
“I really enjoyed the meals,” she says. “I liked that they were delivered directly to my home.”
While Boler notes that “spices needed to be added for flavor,” she also says that the food tasted good and the meals were tender and moist.

Mom’s Meals  caters to older adults and specializes in fully prepared, dietitian-designed meals. Most meals cost $8 per serving, making this one of the most budget-friendly services available.
The meal plans suit older adults with medical conditions such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease,  cancer , and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). It also provides a pureed menu that best suits older adults who have difficulty chewing or need a pureed diet due to a medical condition.
Mom’s Meals products are refrigerated and designed to last up to 2 weeks in the fridge, but you can also freeze each meal if needed.
A significant perk is that health insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid may cover all or part of the cost of Mom’s Meals under a “home-delivered meals” benefit, which provides free hot meals for seniors delivered to home. You can contact your insurance company to learn more.

Best meal kits for seniors
Although heat-and-serve prepared meals make for easy meal planning, senior  meal kit delivery services  are an excellent option for those who enjoy home-cooked meals. The following companies deliver meal kits that make delicious,  healthy dishes  without the hassle of grocery shopping or prep work.

Home Chef  provides prepped and portioned ingredients along with easy-to-follow recipe cards, and many of the meals are ready to eat in less than 30 minutes.
But the company also provides salads, grill-ready meals, and oven-ready meals that require no prep work for people who want to save time in the kitchen. These meals are available on the “Fresh & Easy” option.
Home Chef offers a variety of recipes each week and provides  low carb , low calorie, and vegetarian entrees. Recipes vary in skill level, but most are appropriate for beginners.
“The meals on the Home Chef menu are grouped by how long they take to prepare, so it’s easy to find convenient options,” says Healthline writer   SaVanna Shoemaker , MS, RDN, LD. “I tried the Chicken Lorraine and Turkey Burrito Skillet, and both meals took about 30 minutes to prepare. Once the vegetables were chopped, the meals came together pretty quickly.”
She adds that compared with other meal kit services she’s tested, “I found that Home Chef’s recipes generally took less time and required less prep work.”

Sunbasket ’s certified organic meal kits are a good choice for health-conscious older adults who prefer organic food. “While Sunbasket’s meal kits are more expensive, the meals were incredibly flavorful, and the freshness and quality of the ingredients stood out from other meal kit delivery services I’ve tried,” says Healthline nutrition editor  Kelli McGrane,  MS, RD.

Green Chef also offers add-ons, including breakfast items like oatmeals, egg bites, and muffins, and proteins like ground beef, salmon, and chicken cutlets.
“While some of the ingredient proportions were a bit off and the timing of some of the steps could’ve been better, I overall think this is one of the best meal delivery services thanks to the quality ingredients and flavorful dishes,” says Healthline Nutrition Editor  Kelli McGrane,  MS, RD.
She adds that she appreciated that the meals “contain a good amount of vegetables. Plus, all of the meals I tried were flavorful and satisfying to eat.”
Healthline Editor  Christy Snyder  also had a positive experience with Green Chef and notes that the meals were high quality and tasted great.
“I was really satisfied with the delivery, packaging, quality of ingredients, and the way the meals cooked up,” says Snyder. “I wouldn’t change a thing!”
Although Green Chef is certified organic, it may use conventional substitutes when an organic ingredient isn’t available. The service will notify customers if a conventional ingredient is used instead.
In addition to using high quality organic ingredients, Green Chef uses recyclable packaging and offsets 100% of its direct carbon emissions. This makes it a good choice for older adults who want to lower their carbon footprint.

A comparison of the best meal delivery services for seniors

How we chose these meal delivery services
While researching the  best meal delivery services  for older adults, we considered the following factors:
Price:  We included services at a variety of price points to accommodate different budgets.
Meals per week:  Because some older adults may find it difficult to regularly shop for food and make healthy meals at home, we included services with various subscription options that will allow you to choose the number of meals you need per week.
Variety of healthy options:  We looked for services that provide nutritious meals and meal kits and offer recommended meals and diets for specific health conditions.
Taste and ease of preparation:  We looked for services that offer meals that are easy to prepare, and we tried many of them to find out whether the flavors and textures held up well to refrigeration and reheating.
Customer reviews:  We considered customer satisfaction with these services and looked at reviews based on experience with customer service, food taste and variety, and more.
Vetting:  The services on our list have been vetted to ensure that they align with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being. You can read more information about  our vetting process .

How to choose the best meal delivery service for seniors
Choosing a food delivery service ensures that there will always be a balanced and filling meal option available, which is important for older adults who don’t want to cook or cannot do so. Many older adults have  poor nutritional intake , which can cause and worsen health conditions, such as osteoporosis, muscle loss, and malnutrition.
Meal delivery services can help older adults meet their daily needs for essential nutrients, including protein, a macronutrient that’s especially important for older adults. As we age, we lose muscle mass and strength faster. Because of this, experts in the field of aging  recommend that older adults consume  more than the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of protein (0.36 grams [g] of protein per pound per day),  up to  0.45–0.54 g of protein per pound per day.
Adding  high protein ingredients  to meals and snacks, like chicken, seafood, Greek yogurt, and lentils, can help older adults meet their protein needs. Though every person has different nutrition needs, most older adults will benefit from meals with a higher content of protein and  fiber , a nutrient that’s essential for digestive health.
Older adults with health conditions, such as diabetes and kidney disease, may benefit from meal services designed to help manage their symptoms. For example, Magic Kitchen offers  low sodium  and dialysis- and  renal-friendly meals .
Additionally, those who live alone may prefer a meal service that offers fully prepared, one-person meals that can be frozen for future use.
For those who enjoy preparing home-cooked meals, a meal kit delivery service can provide ingredients to make nutritious meals without the need for shopping.
Note that some older adults may qualify for a  home-delivered meals  benefit through their health insurance plans. Contact your health insurance company for more information.

Frequently asked questions about senior meal delivery
