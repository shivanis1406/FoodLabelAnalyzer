Title: What is Serrapeptase?

Serrapeptase is a proteolytic enzyme, meaning it breaks down proteins into smaller components called amino acids. Along with its anti-inflammatory properties, it may offer a host of other health benefits. However, it’s not recommended for people who already take blood-thinning medications.
Serrapeptase — also known as serratiopeptidase — is a proteolytic enzyme, meaning it breaks down proteins into smaller components called  amino acids .
It’s produced by bacteria in the digestive tract of silkworms and allows the emerging moth to digest and dissolve its cocoon.
The use of proteolytic enzymes like trypsin, chymotrypsin, and bromelain came into practice in the United States during the 1950s after it was observed that they had anti-inflammatory effects.
The  same observation  was made with serrapeptase in Japan during the late 1960s when researchers initially isolated the enzyme from the silkworm.
In fact, researchers in Europe and Japan proposed that serrapeptase was the most effective proteolytic enzyme for  reducing inflammation .
Since then, it has been found to have several possible uses and promising health benefits.

May reduce inflammation
Serrapeptase is most commonly used for  reducing inflammation  — your body’s response to injury.
In dentistry, the enzyme has been used following minor surgical procedures — such as tooth removal — to reduce pain, lockjaw (spasming of the jaw muscles), and facial swelling.
Serrapeptase is thought to decrease inflammatory cells at the affected site.
One  review of five studies  aimed to identify and confirm the  anti-inflammatory  effects of serrapeptase compared to other drugs after the surgical removal of wisdom teeth.
Researchers concluded that serrapeptase was more effective at improving lockjaw than ibuprofen and corticosteroids, powerful drugs that tame inflammation.
What’s more, though corticosteroids were found to outperform serrapeptase in reducing facial swelling the day after surgery, differences between the two later on were insignificant.
Still, due to a lack of eligible studies, no analysis could be performed for pain.
In the same study, researchers also concluded that serrapeptase has a better safety profile than the other drugs used in the analysis — suggesting that it could serve as an alternative in cases of intolerance or adverse side effects to other medications.

May curb pain
Serrapeptase has been shown to reduce pain — a common symptom of inflammation — by inhibiting pain-inducing compounds.
One study  looked at the effects of serrapeptase in nearly 200 people with inflammatory ear, nose, and throat conditions.
Researchers found that the participants who supplemented with serrapeptase had significant reductions in pain severity and mucus production compared to those who took a placebo.
Similarly,  another study  observed that serrapeptase significantly reduced pain intensity compared to a placebo in 24 people following the  removal of wisdom teeth .
In  another study , it was also found to reduce swelling and pain in people following dental surgery — but was less effective than a corticosteroid.
Ultimately, more research is needed to confirm the potential pain-reducing effects of serrapeptase and to determine what other conditions it may be useful in treating before it can be recommended.

May prevent infections
Serrapeptase may decrease your risk of bacterial infections.
In a so-called biofilm, bacteria can join together to form a protective barrier around their group.
This biofilm acts as a shield against antibiotics, allowing bacteria to grow rapidly and cause infection.
Serrapeptase inhibits the formation of biofilms, thereby increasing the effectiveness of antibiotics.
Research  has suggested that serrapeptase improves the efficacy of antibiotics in treating  Staphylococcus aureus  ( S. aureus ), a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections.
In fact,  test-tube and animal studies  have shown that antibiotics were more effective when combined with serrapeptase in treating  S. aureus  than antibiotic treatment alone.
What’s more, the combination of serrapeptase and  antibiotics  was also effective in treating infections that had become resistant to the effects of antibiotics.
Several other  studies  and reviews have suggested that serrapeptase in combination with antibiotics may be a good strategy to reduce or stop the progression of infection — especially from antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

May dissolve blood clots
Serrapeptase may be beneficial in treating atherosclerosis, a condition where plaque builds up  inside your arteries .
It’s thought to act by breaking down dead or damaged tissue and fibrin — a tough protein formed in blood clots.
This could enable serrapeptase to dissolve plaque in your arteries or  dissolve blood clots  that may lead to stroke or heart attack.
A  2021 review  suggests that the fibrinolytic effects of serrapeptase may be beneficial in treating thrombosis resulting from COVID-19.
However, much of the information on its ability to dissolve blood clots is based on personal stories rather than facts. Therefore, more research is necessary to determine what role — if any — serrapeptase plays in treating blood clots.

May be useful for chronic respiratory diseases
Serrapeptase may increase the clearance of mucus and reduce inflammation in the lungs in people with chronic respiratory diseases (CRD).
CRDs are diseases of the airways and other structures of the lungs.
Common ones include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension — a type of high blood pressure that affects the vessels in your lungs.
While CRDs are incurable, various treatments can help dilate the air passages or increase mucus clearance, improving quality of life.
In  one 4-week study , 29 people with chronic bronchitis were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg of serrapeptase or a placebo daily.
Bronchitis is one type of COPD that leads to coughing and difficulty breathing due to the overproduction of mucus.
People who were given serrapeptase had less mucus production compared to the placebo group and were better able to clear the mucus from their lungs.
A  2021 study  also showed symptom improvement in subjects with pulmonary fibrosis who took serrapeptase.
However, further studies are needed to support these findings.

Dosing and supplements
When taken orally, serrapeptase is easily destroyed and deactivated by your stomach acid before it has a chance to reach  your intestines  to be absorbed.
For this reason, dietary supplements containing serrapeptase should be enteric-coated, which prevents them from being dissolved in the stomach and allows for release in the intestine.
The doses typically used in studies range from  10 mg to 60 mg  per day.
The enzymatic activity of serrapeptase is measured in units, with  10 mg equalling 20,000 units  of enzyme activity.
You should take it on an empty stomach or at least 30 mins before eating or two hours after finishing a meal.

Potential dangers and side effects
There are few  published studies  specifically on the potential adverse reactions to serrapeptase.
However, studies have reported several side effects in people taking the enzyme, including:
skin reactions
muscle and joint pain
poor appetite
nausea
stomach pain
cough
blood clotting disturbances
Serrapeptase  should not be taken  along with blood thinners — such as Warfarin and aspirin — other dietary supplements like  garlic ,  fish oil , and turmeric, which may increase your risk of bleeding or bruising.

Should you supplement with serrapeptase?
The potential uses and benefits of supplementing with serrapeptase are limited, and research evaluating the efficacy of serrapeptase is currently restricted to a few small studies.
There’s also a lack of data on the tolerability and long-term safety of this  proteolytic enzyme .
As such, further extensive clinical studies are needed to prove the value of serrapeptase as a dietary supplement.
If you do choose to experiment with serrapeptase, make sure to speak with your healthcare provider first to determine whether it’s right for you.

The bottom line
Serrapeptase is an enzyme that’s been used in Japan and Europe for decades for pain and inflammation.
It may also decrease your risk of infections, prevent blood clots, and aid certain chronic respiratory diseases.
While promising, more research is needed to confirm the efficacy and long-term safety of serrapeptase.
