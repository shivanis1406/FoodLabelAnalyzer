Title: Yohimbe: Benefits, Side Effects, and Uses

Yohimbe is a supplement that can help treat erectile dysfunction (ED) or promote fat loss. However, taking yohimbe supplements carries certain health risks, and itâ€™s not suitable for everyone.
Yohimbe is a popular dietary supplement made from the bark of an African evergreen tree.
It is commonly used to treat erectile dysfunction. It has also become a growing trend among bodybuilders to help with fat loss. Despite its popularity, there are some risks that you may want to consider before taking this supplement.
This article explains yohimbe and its benefits, uses, and potential dangers.

What is yohimbe?
Yohimbe is an herbal supplement. It has a long history of use in West African traditional medicine to  improve sexual performance .
More recently, manufacturers have marketed yohimbe as a dietary supplement with various common uses, from treating medical conditions like  erectile dysfunction  to aiding in weight loss.
The supplement comes from the bark of  the Pausinystalia yohimbe, an evergreen tree found in western and central Africa .
It is sold in capsule or tablet form and marketed as yohimbe bark extract or yohimbine, the active ingredient in yohimbe bark. Many believe that yohimbine  works by blocking receptors  called alpha-2 adrenergic receptors.
Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors play an important role in inhibiting erections. Therefore, yohimbine  is thought  to help alleviate erectile dysfunction by blocking the receptors responsible for preventing erections.

Erectile dysfunction
Yohimbe is  most well known  for its purported ability to alleviate erectile dysfunction. Animal studies show that the active ingredient yohimbine can increase sexual activity by engaging the alpha-2 adrenergic receptors.
Its effects likely stem from the engagement of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the corpus cavernosum, the chambers in the penis that fill with blood during an erection. Taking yohimbe can result in sustained engorgement of blood in the penis tissue.

Weight loss
Yohimbe supplements are also marketed as helping with  weight loss  and improving body composition.
Studies  say it may increase the plasma concentration in fatty free acids, although the time a person takes the supplement can affect the proposed result of weight loss.

Risks
Yohimbine is available as a prescription drug called yohimbine hydrochloride for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. However, supplements sold as yohimbe bark extract or yohimbine hydrochloride are also readily available over the counter.
The main concerns with yohimbe as a dietary supplement are inaccurate labeling of the product and potentially serious side effects.
According to the  National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) , it is illegal in the United States to sell over-the-counter products that contain yohimbine as a treatment for erectile dysfunction without official approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to do so.
Because dietary supplements are not strictly regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there is no guarantee that the product you are getting is exactly what is on the label.
This is highly concerning because it puts you at an increased risk of taking a higher dose of this supplement than you intended, which could lead to harmful side effects.
Taking these supplements comes with the risk of several potentially dangerous side effects.
The  NCCIH  states that side effects can include:
heart attacks
seizures
stomach problems
tachycardia (a rapid heart rate)
anxiety
high blood pressure

Should you take yohimbe?
Many people should not take yohimbe. People with a history of heart disease, high or low blood pressure, and mental health conditions  should not take  yohimbe.
Pregnant people and children under the age of 18 years should also refrain from using yohimbe.
If you have erectile dysfunction and are seeking to alleviate symptoms, consider talking with your doctor about treatment options. There are now safer and more effective medications, so doctors prescribe yohimbine hydrochloride less frequently.
The current evidence for the effects of yohimbe on weight loss is inconclusive. There are numerous other lifestyle changes you can make to help you lose weight.
Overall, because of the prevalence of inaccurate labeling and potential side effects, it may be safest to avoid this supplement altogether.
If you do decide to take yohimbe supplements, buy from a reputable company. Ensure the product has been tested for quality and safety and clearly labels how much yohimbine it contains.

Takeaway
Yohimbe is a popular herbal supplement purported to help with erectile dysfunction and improve body composition and aid weight loss.
Yohimbine is the main active ingredient in yohimbe supplements, and there is evidence to suggest that it can effectively treat erectile dysfunction. However, the research on weight loss and body composition seems to report mixed results.
Studies have revealed several cases of inaccurate labeling on yohimbe products. Not to mention, taking this product comes with the risk of some potentially harmful side effects.
Because of these things, it may be safest to avoid this supplement altogether or at least make sure you are purchasing a product from a reputable company.
