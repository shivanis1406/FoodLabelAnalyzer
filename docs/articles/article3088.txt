Why we love it:  Green Chef is a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) certified organic company that consistently delivers fresh, flavorful meals packed with organic ingredients and options to suit a wide variety of dietary preferences.
Because Green Chef is USDA certified organic, all its produce and eggs are certified organic unless labeled otherwise.
When organic ingredients are unavailable, Green Chef focuses on buying high quality ingredients that are sustainably sourced. However, the company doesn’t provide specific information on where these nonorganic ingredients are sourced from.
Subscribers can choose from more than 46 meals each week, including options for people following specialty diets like keto and vegan.
Meals are dietitian approved and come with premeasured ingredients to help cut down on prep time.
Nearly all of Green Chef’s packaging is recyclable, compostable, or reusable.
Registered Dietician Kelli McGrane tried the Bulgogi Noodle Bowls (by far her favorite), Creamy Pesto Penne Bowls, and Apricot Chickpea Couscous Bowls.
She found that all of the recipes were flavorful and bursting with vegetables. “I did find some of the proportions of ingredients to be a bit off (for example, too many chickpeas relative to the amount of couscous in the apricot recipe).”
But McGrane said she did not need any additional ingredients to add flavor. “And I like that Green Chef’s meals contain a good amount of vegetables. All of the ingredients were premeasured and several came preshredded or chopped, which made the meals even easier and faster to prepare.”
She said the ingredients were grouped by recipe in paper bags — a feature McGrane really liked, as she said it helps keep your fridge organized and saves you time. “While there was certainly a lot of plastic, I appreciated that each item included a note at the bottom on how to recycle it.”

Jacob Moore, who doesn’t typically follow a keto diet, also tried Green Chef’s keto meals and was pleasantly surprised. He was impressed with the variety, which included Mediterranean, Italian, and Latin options.
He noted, “The Salmon Bulgur Bowl was filling with plenty of protein but still felt light. This was one of my overall favorites and one that I could eat multiple times per week.” He and his wife also enjoyed the Ancho Chicken Soup and Italian-Style Surf ‘n’ Turf.
As for ingredients and packaging, Moore commented, “Quality and convenience were great but the trade-off was that the packaging is pretty unsustainable. Items are individually packaged to ensure the quality of the food, but this means that there is a lot of packaging to throw away at the end of each meal.”
While the recipes were easy to follow, they sometimes took longer than estimated. “I found that a 30-minute meal usually took around 45 minutes to prepare if I was moving at a natural pace,” Jacob mentioned.
He concluded that, overall, Green Chef’s keto meals were flavorful and enjoyable, but the price point might not suit everyone, especially given the cooking effort required.

Why we love it:  Trifecta Nutrition offers nutritionally balanced, preportioned meals that can be reheated in the microwave in fewer than 3 minutes.
Whether you’re trying to lose weight, gain muscle, or simply keep track of your  macros , Trifecta Nutrition makes it easy to follow your meal plan to work toward your wellness goals.
In addition to providing macronutrient information on each meal, the company offers a companion app that offers subscribers personalized nutrition and fitness plans. Trifecta also has a team of nutrition experts available to answer any questions you might have.
Menus rotate each week, and meals are selected for you, but you can set up two food preferences or allergies in your account profile. Any recipes containing those ingredients will be replaced with a duplicate of one of the other meals for the week.
You also have the option to pick and choose individual Classic Meals or to easily tailor your meals to your specific goals by selecting from the à la carte menu.
The company takes pride in sourcing quality ingredients, including:
locally grown and organic produce
grass-fed beef
free-range poultry and pork
cage-free eggs
wild-caught seafood
Meals are delivered once a week. Items can be stored either in the fridge for up to 7 days or in the freezer for 3 months.
Most of Trifecta’s packing materials and food containers are recyclable. According to a customer service representative, the company also uses fully biodegradable packaging materials to help support sustainability.
Registered dietician Rachael Ajmera says “Trifecta Nutrition meals were tasty, filling, and nutritious.” She said meals do require a bit more preparation than some other similar services, but affirmed they are generally very easy to make and may help save time on cooking. “For me, the meals were filling enough for a main course,” Ajmera said.
She said the foods all arrived frozen and were shipped and packaged well. Ajmera said they needed to be reheated on the stove, but were pretty tasty and maintained texture for the most part. She noted a few required additional ingredients, such as spices or veggies to add flavor. Some also included large amounts of spinach, which became slimy after reheating.
“I wouldn’t recommend this to picky eaters because you’re unable to choose your own meals and can only select up to two ingredients to exclude. However, I think it may be worthwhile for people who are adventurous eaters, athletes, people with a busy schedule, and those following vegan, paleo, or keto diet plans.”

Taylor Morelli tested Trifecta Nutrition’s keto meal offerings and found them convenient, but with some drawbacks. She received seven meals, noting, “the meals I received were varied enough, but definitely room for more variation.” Some ingredients, like green beans and guacamole, were repeated multiple times, which she felt limited the overall creativity of the dishes.
Morelli’s favorite meal was the Romesco Steak with Vegetables and Guacamole, though she mentioned, “The steak was a little chewy on this one, but overall, this was my favorite of all the meals.” She also tried other dishes like Buffalo Chicken Pasta and Brisket Burrito, where the flavors and textures were less impressive.
On the positive side, Morelli appreciated Trifecta’s use of recyclable packaging and eco-friendly gel packs. She liked the convenience of having meals ready in a couple of minutes. “It was just 2 minutes in the microwave, and dinner was ready,” she said. However, she felt that portion sizes were a bit small, especially considering the calorie counts.
Overall, while Morelli found some aspects of Trifecta Nutrition’s keto meal service appealing, she wasn’t fully convinced it was worth the price compared with other options like Factor Meals, which she found more enjoyable and filling.

Why we love it:  Blue Apron has options that take 30 minutes or less to cook, and plans that are big enough for families.
Blue Apron uses USDA certified organic when possible and aims to source ingredients from farmers who use sustainable practices.
The company has also periodically teamed up with Disney and Pixar to create nutritious, kid-friendly recipes that encourage kids to get into the kitchen. These meals include recipe cards with tips on kid-friendly kitchen tasks and portion sizes.
As with many other services, the menu offerings rotate weekly. Customers can use the online ordering platform to update their selections and delivery information.
Blue Apron’s meal kit delivery comes with ingredients preprepped and ready for cooking. Recipe cards are included. Some recipes can be completed in fewer than 30 minutes, making them convenient for weeknight family dinners.
More than 85% of Blue Apron’s packaging is recyclable by weight, according to the company. It also works with  How2Recycle  to help subscribers identify how and where to recycle packaging materials.
Blue Apron has limited offerings to accommodate food allergies or intolerances. If you have a specific diet restriction or food allergies, this service may not be a good fit.
Kelli McGrane, a registered dietician and writer says, she first tried Blue Apron over 10 years ago in college, “and I remember really liking it at that time, though it was too expensive to keep up with on a college budget. Trying it this time, I was happy to see that the quality of the ingredients hadn’t gone down.”
McGrane said that all of the ingredients were in good condition and seemed fresh upon arrival. “While I didn’t love all of the plastic packaging, I did appreciate that the salmon was vacuum-sealed and that the chicken was packaged in two layers of plastic to prevent juices from seeping out.”
McGrane adds that, “the Spanish-Spiced Salmon and Veggie Quinoa with Almond-Date Topping was really tasty. Love the packaging of the salmon compared to other services (vacuum-sealed). The almond date topping provided a good variety of texture, and the sweetness of the dates paired well with the salmon. It took less than 30 minutes to prepare.”

Why we love it:  Daily Harvest offers a variety of frozen,  plant-based meals  for every time of day. The meals are easy to reheat and feature nutrient-dense ingredients, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.
While the service uses some conventional produce, approximately 95% is organic. You can view a detailed list of which ingredients are organic and which are conventionally grown for each item on the company’s website.
Unlike other services that focus on dinner meal kits, Daily Harvest offers more than 120 vegan options that include a variety of:
premade frozen smoothies
oat bowls
chia bowls
flatbreads
grain bowls
soups
snack bites
lattes
ice cream
The goal of Daily Harvest is to make it easier to incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your diet.
As a result, each recipe features a base of produce, along with other high quality plant-based ingredients.
Some recipes require you to provide additional liquid, such as plant-based milk for blending the smoothie packets and vegetable broth to reheat the soups.
Items arrive fully frozen and can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months.
Except for the flatbreads, which require an oven or toaster oven, all of the items can be quickly reheated in the microwave or thawed in the fridge.
Daily Harvest offers several delivery options. You choose how many items you’d like to order as well as the delivery frequency, with discounts available for larger orders.
It’s worth mentioning that the company did  voluntarily recall  its Lentil and Leek Crumbles after reports of illness, which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined was likely linked to the ingredient tara flour.
“Daily Harvest is a convenient and time-saving way to round out your diet with more vegan-friendly, organic, and gluten-free snacks and meals. Most meals were pretty flavorful, but the portion sizes were small and not very filling. Therefore, I would recommend using it alongside other meals or snacks to help round out your diet.
“For the most part, all items are easy to prepare and are generally very tasty. Though I found that the harvest bowls didn’t maintain their texture well after reheating, and smoothies can be challenging to fully blend.
“Many items are relatively low in protein, so it might not be filling enough for some people. However, Daily Harvest is affordable, offers a good variety of items, and has a flexible ordering process, so it’s easy to try different items to find what works for you.
“I think Daily Harvest could be a good fit for people interested in stocking their freezer with a few vegan and gluten-free snacks to enjoy between meals. It could also be used as a supplement for a healthy diet or ordered to have some easy lunches on hand when you’re short on time.”
— Rachael Ajmera, MS, RD
Anne Arntson also tested Daily Harvest’s plant-based meal delivery service. Anne, who has followed a mostly plant-based diet since she was 8 years old, was excited to try the service because of its focus on fresh, organic ingredients.
She found the variety impressive, noting, “I was shocked by the number of delicious-sounding (and plant-based) options that Daily Harvest offers. I had a difficult time choosing which meals to try because so many of them sounded good.” Arntson also appreciated that all the meals are gluten-free, which wasn’t immediately obvious but a nice surprise.
Daily Harvest’s frozen meals stood out to Arntson for their convenience, especially during a heatwave, as she could avoid time in the kitchen. She loved the ease of simply blending or reheating the meals.
However, she did note that some meals require additional kitchen equipment or ingredients, like broth for soups or a blender for smoothies, which may make them less ideal for people wanting a complete grab-and-go option.
Arntson found the frozen meals to retain good flavor and texture, stating, “The fruits and veggies had good flavor. Nothing was mushy or tasted like typical frozen food.”
Some of her favorites were the Mint + Cacao Smoothie, the Shiitake + Spinach Grits, and the Mango + Passion Fruit Pops. She described the grits as “very savory — with an umami-like blend of spices — and just had an overall warm flavor.”
However, Arntson found some dishes lacking, like the Bell Pepper + Cilantro Flatbread, which she thought needed more seasoning and had an off texture. Overall, she felt that the service was worth the price for certain standout items, though she would be selective in her future orders.

Why we love it:  Sunbasket provides dietitian- and chef-crafted meals featuring high quality, sustainable ingredients and creative flavor combinations.
Sunbasket estimates that 99% of the produce it uses is organic, along with all organic:
milk
yogurt
eggs
tofu
Organic meat and poultry are also available for select recipes.
The company focuses on sourcing humanely raised meat and poultry, and wild-caught or sustainably farmed seafood. These ingredients, however, are not always organic.
Sunbasket caters to a wide variety of dietary needs, including Mediterranean, keto,  pescatarian , and vegan. When ordering, you can also filter the menu choices to make meal selection even easier.
Meals packed in recyclable and compostable packaging are another highlight of Sunbasket’s meal kits. However, some ingredients may come in plastic bags or containers that are not recyclable, depending on your location.
“Out of all of the meal kits I’ve tried, Sunbasket’s ingredients tasted the freshest, especially the seafood and meats. I found most of the dishes to be bursting with flavor and appreciated the wide variety of ingredients used, especially vegetables.
“My favorite meal I tried was the Mojo Tacos with Shredded Cabbage, Pickled Onions, and Salsa Verde. It was super quick and easy, yet very flavorful. The corn tortillas were much better than anything you’ll find at the grocery store (at least in Denver).
“I also tried the Black Angus Rib-Eyes with Warm Kale, Romanesco, and Goat Cheese Salad. The meat was good quality, and I found that the garlic porcini seasoning didn’t overpower the steaks. I was happy with the portion, and the romanesco was a fun vegetable that my family hadn’t tried before.
“It isn’t cheap, but I think Sunbasket offers the highest quality ingredients and most exciting flavor combinations. Plus, it has multiple menus to suit a variety of dietary needs.”
— Kelli McGrane, MS, RD
Ren Dias also tested Sunbasket’s keto meal delivery service. Dias does not typically follow a keto diet and found it challenging to find options that fit her preferences, which included keto, low sodium, and low added sugar.
“The ‘picked for me’ only included one meal kit that met my needs,” she noted. While signing up was straightforward, Dias wished there had been more keto-friendly choices available each week.
Dias found the portion sizes generous, particularly for the Spiced Pakistani Beef Keema. “The serving sizes were bigger than it let on. I was pleasantly surprised with how many leftovers we had!” However, cooking times often exceeded estimates, with the Beef Keema taking 75 minutes, which felt long with a hungry toddler at home.
While the meals were generally flavorful, Dias noted some quality issues with ingredients, like freezer-burned tomatoes and browned green beans.
She appreciated Sunbasket’s sustainable packaging but wished labeling on recyclable materials was clearer.
Overall, Dias found the meals tasty but felt that the limited variety and lengthy cooking times made Sunbasket less appealing for long-term use, stating, “I don’t think it’s worth the price long term for someone following a keto diet.”

Why we love it:  Tiny Organics is one of the  best baby food delivery services , offering 100% organic plant-based meals that introduce your baby or toddler to new textures and flavors.
Tiny Organics meals are developed by neonatal nutritionists and are free of  added sugar  and salt. Meals feature nutrient-rich ingredients to support your growing baby, including fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains.
In addition to its signature Tiny Meals, which are ideal for  baby-led weaning , the company also offers purees and toddler-size bowls.
Tiny Organics meals are flash-frozen and can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months.
“Tiny Organics is one of my favorite  kid-friendly meal delivery  services. The meals are easy to reheat in the microwave and take up very little freezer space.
“More importantly, I like that the ingredient lists are impressively short, and that the meals introduced my son to seasonings and ingredients that I wouldn’t have thought to try until he was older.
“My 10-month-old happily took bites from every meal that we tried. He particularly loved the Bananas Foster, Coconut Curry, and Oat Em Gee.”

Catherine Conelly, mother of two, recently tested Tiny Organics’ toddler-friendly meal delivery service. Conelly was drawn to the service’s simplicity and convenience, especially during a busy phase of life.
She appreciated that the meals were made with simple ingredients and without excessive preservatives, making them a healthier option compared with many processed foods. “All the ingredients seem to be very simple without a bunch of added ingredients that I can’t pronounce,” Conelly said.
The ordering process was straightforward, though Conelly did experience some issues with the majority of the meals being temporarily out of stock. Once they arrived, the meals were well packaged, with dry ice to maintain quality during transit.
The convenience of individually sealed meals was a highlight for Conelly, allowing her to easily pair a Tiny Organics dish with other items, like oatmeal alongside her toddler’s morning waffle. She noted, “Depending on your toddler’s ever-changing appetite, they could be used as a small snack or alongside another item you may be preparing.”
Conelly tried a range of meals, including the Banana Butternut Bowl, Baby Burrito Bowl, and Coconut Curry. She found the portion sizes to be appropriate for toddlers and enjoyed the ease of preparation, requiring just a few minutes in the microwave.
The meals provided a convenient option for busier days or as a supplement to regular meals, but Conelly felt that ordering them regularly could be costly. “I think for busy seasons of life when you need to give yourself a break, or for when you’re trying to introduce new foods, it’s a convenient option,” Conelly said.
However, she mentioned she would likely use it more occasionally rather than committing to a regular subscription.

Organic meal delivery services compared

How we test meal delivery services
Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate menus and ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the meal delivery services on this page, we considered all the services that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further.  Read more about how we test meal delivery services.
Testers select a week’s worth of meals from multiple menus to get a well-rounded view of the types of flavors and ingredients offered.
As part of our testing, we consider several factors, including the ease of the signup and meal selection process, the variety and nutritional composition of the meals offered, ingredient quality and freshness, ease of cooking, and, of course, the taste. We score them accordingly.

How to choose an organic meal kit
There are several factors to consider when choosing an organic meal delivery service. As you search for an organic meal delivery service, keep these items front of mind:
What “organic” means to different companies:  Some companies source only organic produce, while others include additional organic items, such as eggs or tofu. Others use non-organic ingredients if they need to. You can choose the service that most closely aligns with your preferences.
Diet friendliness:  If you’re following a specific diet, choosing a service that offers a wide variety of recipes to fit your dietary needs can be helpful. For example, if you’re following a vegan or low calorie diet, you might look for a service offering plant-based meals or organic meal delivery for weight loss.
Variety for your dietary preferences:  If you’re following a diet such as keto or vegan, choosing a service that offers an array of recipes to fit your dietary needs can be helpful.
Food allergies:  If you have severe food allergies, it’s essential to ensure that the company you choose has strict protocols to avoid cross-contamination.
Ease of preparation:  Meal services are meant to make your life easier. Some services send the ingredients you need to prepare meals at home, while others ship fully prepared items that just need to be reheated. One of these two approaches could be better for you, depending on your time constraints.
Other factors to consider include cost and delivery availability. In addition, you may want to opt for services that use recyclable packaging materials and sustainably sourced ingredients and prioritize animal welfare.
Here are some labels you can look out for to  identify if a food is truly organic  or not:
USDA Organic Seal:  The USDA has established an official organic certification program. To obtain this seal, produce must meet strict government standards.
100% organic:  The product is made entirely from organic ingredients.
Organic:  At least 95% of the ingredients in the product are organic.
Made with organic ingredients:  At least 70% of the ingredients used are organic. These products cannot be labeled organic or use the USDA Organic Seal.

Potential benefits of eating organic
Choosing an  organic  meal delivery service ensures you receive meals prepared according to  strict USDA standards . As part of these  standards , these foods must be grown or raised without the use of hormones, antibiotics, artificial chemicals, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
Some people may prefer to purchase organic foods because organic farming practices  tend to be more environmentally friendly  and result in  reduced levels  of pesticide residues on crops like fruits, vegetables, and grains.
Organic foods  may have  a slightly different nutritional profile than their conventional counterparts, though more research is needed.
