Sometimes, finding the time to shop for ingredients, plan meals, and cook just isn’t possible for people leading busy lives working, caring for a family, or running a household.
Several meal delivery services can help make meal prep easier. However, they differ in meal types, suitability for various diets, quality of ingredients, variety of flavors, and cost.
Our testers tried 35 of the most popular meal prep companies to see which ones could fit busier lifestyles. Keep reading to see our five dietitian-approved favorites, plus a few other services that narrowly missed the cut.

Why we love it:  Blue Apron provides consistently high quality meals that can help you build confidence in the kitchen while enjoying more nutritious, home-cooked meals, earning it our choice as the best overall meal delivery service.
While there aren’t as many meals to choose from each week, we still found that the service does a good job of providing a wide variety of ingredients and flavor profiles to keep your tastebuds happy. We also liked that there’s at least one oven-ready meal offered each week.
How it works:  Blue Apron delivers meals weekly, with options for two or four servings per meal and two to five meals per week. The service preselects meals for you based on your diet preferences. However, you can easily change your order by swapping one (or all) of the preselected meals for any of the 15+ recipes offered that week.
Tester’s takeaway:  According to registered dietitian and expert tester Kelli McGrane, after trying more than 25 meal delivery services over the years, Blue Apron is the one that she keeps coming back to thanks to its creative flavors and high quality ingredients — hello, fresh pasta and pizza dough!
As a working mom with two young kids, McGrane also appreciated that the recipes “came with easy-to-follow recipe cards and didn’t require quite as much multitasking as some of the other services I tried.”

Why we love it:  Factor, formerly known as Factor 75, is one of the best meal prep companies, offering chef-created, dietitian-approved, fully prepared meals that reheat well, are nutritionally balanced, and are satisfying to eat.
We tested Factor several times and asked each tester to rate the service in a few key areas. Overall, our testers rated Factor highly when it comes to nutrition quality, ingredient quality, ease of preparation, and taste.
How it works:  Factor offers six menus catering to a variety of dietary needs, including Keto, Calorie Smart, and Vegan & Veggie, and delivers 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 18 meals per week. You have full control over which meals you receive, including the option to add breakfast items or cold-press juices to your order.
Tester’s takeaway:  According to McGrane, who tried the service for 2 weeks, “I’m usually skeptical when it comes to  prepared meals  since it’s hard to compete with freshly made dinners. However, Factor pleasantly surprised me. Not only were the dishes flavorful, but the textures of the ingredients were also spot-on.
“Specifically, the salmon was moist and not fishy, the chicken was juicy, and the vegetables were tender without being mushy. Even the  quinoa  in the Herbed Quinoa Pesto Bowl had a soft yet chewy texture.”

Why we love it:  Home Chef offers several types of easy-prep meal kits, including Oven Ready, Fast & Fresh, Express, and Family Menu meal bundles. These meal kits make it easy to get dinner on the table, especially on busy weeknights.
Home Chef’s Oven Ready meals come ready to bake in oven-safe trays. The service also offers Express meals, which take about 15 minutes to prepare, and Fast & Fresh meals, which are more nutritious options that can be prepared quickly.
For busy families, Home Chef recently debuted its new Family Menu plan, which features 10+ weekly rotating recipes, all of which require minimal prep.
In addition to being easy to prepare, Home Chef scored highly for its ease of sign-up, meal variety, nutrition quality, and taste.
How it works:  To get started, you’ll first complete a quiz, which asks questions about your reasons for choosing a meal kit service, your food preferences, and how many meals you’d like to receive each week. Box size options include two to six meals, with two, four, or six servings each.
While the service preselects meals for you based on your preferences, you can also create your own custom meal plan by selecting other options from Home Chef’s full menu.
Tester’s takeaway:  Home Chef’s meals were a hit with our tester’s whole family. SaVanna Shoemaker, MS, RDN, LD, noted: “Everyone really liked the Chicken Lorraine. It came together really quickly, and the sauce for the chicken was delicious.
“I was pleasantly surprised by how much my kids liked the Turkey Burrito Skillet, too — especially since it was full of vegetables. We would definitely use the service again if we ever needed some easy, quick weeknight meals.”
McGrane, who tried the company’s Family Plan, also enjoyed the service: “This was my first experience trying Home Chef, and I wasn’t quite sure what to expect. Overall, I was impressed by the ingredient quality (particularly the chicken) and how easy the meals really are to make.
“The dishes were also packed with flavor yet still approachable for my picky toddler. My biggest complaint was the lack of vegetables.”

Meal type   meal kit
Why we love it:  Owned by the parent company of  HelloFresh  and Green Chef, EveryPlate is one of the  best value meal kit  companies on the market and can be an affordable, family-friendly alternative to pricier services.
While it doesn’t offer the same exciting flavor combinations or higher quality ingredients that some of the other services on our list do, EveryPlate is still a solid option for people who want to save time meal planning and grocery shopping without breaking the bank.
Plus, most meals are ready to enjoy in 30 minutes or less and require only six steps of preparation.
How it works:  Meals are delivered weekly, with the option to receive three to six meals containing 1, 4, or 6 servings each. The menu rotates weekly and consists of 21 options from which you can pick and choose to build a custom meal plan.
Tester’s takeaway:  According to McGrane, compared with other meal delivery services she’s tried, EveryPlate didn’t have the same exciting flavor and ingredient combinations.
Still, while the service wouldn’t be her top pick, she noted: “Considering that EveryPlate is almost half the price of similar meal kits and the ingredients arrived fresh and in good condition, I think it’s worth considering if your top priorities are price and convenience.”

Why we love it:  Purple Carrot makes it easy to eat more  plant-based meals  by offering creative flavor and ingredient combinations as well as a line of prepared meals for dinner in a flash.
For those short on time, the service offers single-serving microwaveable meals, as well as Less Prep meals, which are recipes that feature shortcuts to help you put dinner on the table faster, such as pre-chopped vegetables.
During testing, the service scored highly for nutrition quality, ingredient quality, ease of preparation, and taste.
How it works:  Purple Carrot offers plans with three or four meals per week, with two or four servings each. However, you aren’t locked into a certain box size. Unlike other services on our list, you can choose to receive a mix of two- and four-serving meals, as well as add additional meals, like breakfasts and lunches, to your order.
Tester’s takeaway:  McGrane has tried Purple Carrot several times over the years and most recently subscribed to the service for a little under 4 months. McGrane noted that she was drawn to the service as a way to incorporate more creative plant-based recipes into her family’s weekly meal rotation.
According to McGrane: “I really loved Purple Carrot at first. The recipes are unlike what I’d typically cook for dinner, and most of the meals were a hit with my picky toddler. I also appreciated that the meals were generally easier and faster to prepare than they used to be.
“However, after 3 months, I found that the recipes started to feel repetitive week after week. That said, I recently glanced at Purple Carrot’s new summer menu, and I’m tempted to try the service again as it does look quite a bit different from its menu over the winter.”

How to choose a meal delivery service


A comparison of the best meal delivery services
Here’s a quick look at how our top picks compare:

Other services we tried
Narrowing down our favorite food delivery services wasn’t an easy feat. Here are additional services that scored well during testing but fell short of making our top five:
Sunbasket (4.6 out of 5):  Offering exciting flavor combinations, a wide variety of recipes to choose from, and multiple diet-specific menus,  Sunbasket  was one of our favorites during testing. However, because we couldn’t justify the service’s high price point (some meals cost as much as $28 per serving), Sunbasket didn’t make our top five.
HelloFresh (4.2 out of 5):   HelloFresh  is a great option for families and beginners. It’s moderately priced and has a large rotating menu. However, our testers noted that the service can get repetitive after several months.
Green Chef (4.3 out of 5):   Green Chef  is a  certified organic  meal kit subscription service and one of the best options if sustainability is your top priority. It also scored highly for ease of sign-up, meal variety, nutrition quality, and taste.
Trifecta Nutrition (3.8 out of 5):  Featuring dietitian-designed meals that are calorie and portion controlled,  Trifecta Nutrition  is one of the  best meal prep companies for those looking to lose weight . However, our testers had mixed reviews on taste and meal variety.
BistroMD (4.1 out of 5):  Another great option if you’re interested in weight loss,  BistroMD  delivers a week’s worth of low calorie, preportioned meals, including breakfasts, lunches, and dinners.
Territory (4.1 out of 5):   Territory  is a good, but expensive, option if you follow a specialty diet, such as keto, paleo, low carb, or plant-based.  Our tester  noted that the meals tasted incredibly fresh and had a good variety of textures and ingredients.
Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate menus and ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
