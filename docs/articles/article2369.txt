Every year, millions of adults in the United States  try to lose weight .
Along with exercise, dieting is one of the most common methods used to promote weight loss.
However, not all diets are created equal, which can make it challenging to find a weight loss program that’s safe, sustainable, and effective.
This article looks at five of the best weight loss programs in 2024, as well as other eating patterns that are worth considering.

How we chose the best weight loss programs
The weight loss programs below were chosen based on the following criteria:
Nutritional quality:  Weight loss programs are nutritionally balanced and designed to meet nutritional needs.
Sustainability:  Weight loss programs are not overly restrictive, are easy to stick with, and are designed to support long-term weight loss.
Effectiveness for weight loss:  Weight loss programs have all been studied for their ability to promote weight loss.
Additional health benefits:  In addition to supporting weight loss, some programs may offer health benefits for other conditions.
Dietitian review:  All the programs below were reviewed by registered dietitians  Rachael Ajmera , MS, RD, and  Kelli McGrane , MS, RD.

What’s the difference between a weight loss program and a diet?
A weight loss program takes a lot of the guesswork out of losing weight. Programs will often give you a meal plan to follow, and may even offer other help, such as coaching, lessons, and even medication.
Diets, on the other hand, require you to follow specific menus. For example, the Mediterranean diet is high in oils, fish, and fruits and vegetables. Most diets will not give you any other help with your weight loss journey. Weight loss programs can help you stick with a diet.

Healthline’s picks for the best weight loss programs


Most flexible
How it works   WeightWatchers is a well-known diet program that uses a points-based system to promote long lasting, sustainable weight loss.
Price   plans start at $23 per month
Overall diet score: 4.1 out of 5
On WeightWatchers, each food and drink is assigned a Points value based on its nutritional content, and each member is allotted an individualized Points budget each day.
Some foods are also considered ZeroPoint foods, meaning they don’t count toward your daily Points budget.
Because of this, WeightWatchers may be a good option for people who want a little more structure and guidance for weight loss while still being able to dine out and enjoy their favorite foods.
Memberships start at $23 per month and include access to the digital app, which provides tracking tools, educational resources, and community forums to help you reach your goals. WeightWatchers offers plans with access to in-person workshops and one-on-one coaching as well.
Recently, it also launched WeightWatchers Clinic. This program offers access to prescription  weight loss medications  for those who qualify, along with insurance coordination and ongoing support from a board certified clinician.
Effectiveness
According to WeightWatchers, members can expect to lose 1 to 2 pounds (lb) (0.5 to 1 kilograms [kg]) per week, though this will vary from person to person.
Some studies from  2020  and  2021  have also shown that WeightWatchers is beneficial for promoting both short-term and long-term weight loss.
However, one study was funded by WeightWatchers, which may have influenced the results.

Best weight loss app
How it works   Noom is a digital app focused on promoting long-term, sustainable weight loss by helping users build healthy habits.
Price   plans start at $70 per month
MNT visitors get a free 14-day extended trial.
Overall diet score: 3.7 out of 5
Noom is a weight loss app that’s designed to address the why behind your habits, and in turn, hopefully lead to lasting behavior changes.
The app requires a monthly subscription to use, which starts at $70 per month. Your subscription includes access to a virtual coaching team, interactive daily lessons, food and activity tracking tools, and a library of recipes.
The program encourages users to log their daily intake in the app and prioritize foods with a low calorie density. Foods are categorized as orange, yellow, or green based on their nutritional value.
In addition to weight loss, Noom also addresses other aspects of health, including physical activity and mood.
For those who may need additional support, Noom recently introduced Noom Med, which includes access to prescription weight loss medications for eligible members.
Effectiveness
To promote weight loss, Noom helps users reduce their calorie intake by encouraging consumption of foods with a low calorie density.
According to Noom’s website, users can generally expect to lose 1 lb to 2 lb (0.5 kg to 1 kg) per week, though this may depend on several factors, including your starting weight, diet, goals, and activity level.
Limited research suggests that the diet  could be effective  for maintaining weight loss and may  help reduce  the number of binge eating episodes in adults with binge eating disorder.
However, it’s worth noting that the authors of both studies above work for Noom, and this could present a conflict of interest.

Healthline registered dietitian and contributor  Rachael Ajmera, MS, RD  tried Noom for several weeks and came away with mixed feelings.
On one hand, Ajmera found the app intuitive to use, “I can see the simple color-coded system being helpful for promoting long-term weight loss, especially when it’s combined with the quick and easy daily lessons for developing healthy habits.”
Ajmera also noted that while she didn’t personally track her weight while using the app, her mom has successfully lost weight using Noom. “My mom attributes much of her success to her group and personal coach. Both provided motivation and support to help her stick to her diet and reach her goals.”
Still, there were aspects of the app that Ajmera thought could be better. Most notably, she mentioned that because foods are categorized based on calories, nutrient-dense foods are sometimes labeled as yellow or orange foods.
Additionally, she found that her initial calorie goal was set very low and needed to be adjusted, which may not have been obvious to someone who isn’t a nutrition professional.

Best for meal planning
How it works   PlateJoy is a meal planning app designed by dietitians to help make healthier eating easier and more convenient than ever.
Price   starts at $4.99 per month when you sign up through Healthline; $13 per month otherwise
PlateJoy is one of the most customizable meal planning apps, as it builds weekly menus to fit your schedule, dietary preferences, and health goals.
You can even specify portion sizes for each member of your household and select recipes based on the types of kitchen equipment you have on hand.
In addition to weekly meal plans, the app provides curated shopping lists, which you can bring with you to the store or sync with popular grocery delivery services, such as  Instacart  and  Amazon Fresh .
PlateJoy typically costs $12.99 per month, but if you sign up through Healthline, you can subscribe for just $4.99 per month.
It’s worth noting that PlateJoy is owned and operated by Healthline Media.
Read about our experience trying PlateJoy in our hands-on review .
Effectiveness
Although there are no studies on the effectiveness of PlateJoy specifically, meal planning  has been associated  with successful weight loss, a reduced risk of obesity, and  improved  diet quality.
The app also offers options for people following  plant-based  and  ketogenic diets , two diet patterns that have been associated with weight loss.
Plus, PlateJoy provides detailed information on the nutritional content and ingredients for each recipe and includes Balanced Plate badges to aid in building a nutritionally balanced meal plan.
Healthline editor and registered dietitian Kelli McGrane tried PlateJoy as a more affordable alternative to meal delivery services.
According to McGrane, “I’m a sucker for surveys and online quizzes, so getting started with PlateJoy was not only easy, but it was also enjoyable. While some might find the onboarding section to be a bit lengthy, I can reassure you it’s well-worth the effort. I was impressed by how well the weekly meal plan fit my family’s needs and preferences.”
While she acknowledged that it isn’t ideal for people who dislike cooking, and that there’s still a monthly subscription fee so it might not fit all budgets, McGrane was overall happy with her experience.
“As a busy working mom, I think PlateJoy is worth trying if you’re interested in eating healthier or adding variety to your diet without having to spend valuable downtime searching for recipes or creating shopping lists.
“It’s also a good option if you have specific dietary needs or preferences and have a hard time finding recipes that fit your needs.”

Best with GLP-1 medication support
How it works   Calibrate is a comprehensive program that claims to support metabolic health and promote long-term weight loss through a combination of lifestyle changes and prescription medication.
Price   plans start at $146 per month
Overall diet score: 4.2 out of 5
Calibrate’s weight loss program is designed to address the four pillars of metabolic health: food, sleep, exercise, and emotional health.
Members also have regular video calls with a personal coach to monitor their progress and set goals.
Calibrate prescribes  GLP-1 medications , like Ozempic and Wegovy, for members. These injectable medications were  originally developed  to treat diabetes and have also been  shown to support  weight loss.
However, keep in mind that the program has strict eligibility criteria, most of which are related to your age, body mass index, and health status.
Additionally, the program is very expensive, with prices starting at $146 per month.
Read more about Calibrate in our dietitian’s review .
Effectiveness
According to a 2022 report published by Calibrate, members lost an average of  15%  of their body weight after completing the 1-year program.
The program encourages many healthy habits that  can support  long-lasting weight loss, including regular physical activity, adequate sleep, and  increased  fiber and protein intake.
Additionally, the medications that the program prescribes have been shown to  decrease  food cravings and appetite and to  enhance  feelings of fullness, resulting in weight loss over time.
However, keep in mind that GLP-1 medications  have been associated  with weight regain after discontinued use. Some people may also  experience  side effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.
Therefore, before you sign up, it’s best to speak with a healthcare professional to determine whether Calibrate is a good option for you.

Best for diabetes
How it works   The Mayo Clinic Diet is an eating plan originally developed by experts at the Mayo Clinic, a nonprofit hospital system that is considered a leader in medical research.
Price   $19.99 per month for the digital platform
Overall diet score: 3.9 out of 5
The  Mayo Clinic Diet  focuses on developing healthy habits that are important for people with diabetes, such as exercising daily and not skipping meals.
It also promotes nutritious ingredients, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, while limiting added sugars and saturated fat from full fat dairy and high fat meats.
The Mayo Clinic Diet has a digital platform, which starts at $19.99 per month for an annual plan and includes educational content, food tracking tools, and sample meal plans for high protein, Mediterranean, and keto diets.
There’s also a book, “The Mayo Clinic Diabetes Diet,” which outlines guidelines specifically for diabetes.
Effectiveness
Although there aren’t any peer-reviewed studies on the Mayo Clinic Diet specifically, studies  show  that following a diet  high in fiber  and low in saturated fat may aid weight loss. High fiber diets have also  been linked  to better blood sugar management.
The diet also encourages limiting intake of added sugar. While more research is needed, diets high in added sugar have been associated with a  greater risk  of obesity.
You can learn more about the Mayo Clinic Diet on the Mayo Clinic’s website or find valuable information in books on the topic.

How these weight loss programs compare

How to choose a weight loss program
There are a number of factors to consider when finding a diet or weight loss program that works for you. Here are a few key considerations:
Lifestyle and preferences:  To improve your chances of losing weight and keeping it off, it’s important to choose a diet that can easily fit your lifestyle and food preferences.
Realistic approach:  Similarly, look for a diet program or pattern that’s realistic and sustainable. Steer clear of diets that are overly restrictive or promise a quick fix for rapid weight loss.
Effectiveness:  Select a program that’s backed by research and has been shown to be  effective for weight loss .
Whole foods approach:  Look for a program that emphasizes eating whole foods, and be cautious of those that require you to purchase expensive products or supplements to get results.
Lifestyle approach:  Weight loss is about more than just what you eat. It’s important to choose a program that incorporates other healthy habits, such as regular physical activity and mental wellness practices.
If you have any underlying health conditions or are taking any medications, be sure to consult a trusted healthcare professional before making changes to your diet.

What is a weight loss program vs. a diet?
Weight loss programs are commercial diet plans that require a membership or subscription fee and typically offer more structure than  lifestyle diets , such as the Mediterranean diet or plant-based diet.
Weight loss programs typically provide guidance on which foods to eat or avoid, how frequently to exercise, and how to monitor your progress.
Some programs also provide personal coaching, peer support, or resources aimed at helping you build healthy habits in the long run.
On the other hand, lifestyle diets usually offer more general guidelines on which foods are permitted, giving you a bit more wiggle room when making your meal plan.
While some people might enjoy the flexibility of a lifestyle diet, others might find that not having a clear set of rules or regulations to follow can be a bit confusing.
In some cases, weight loss programs may actually make it easier to follow a certain eating pattern by providing additional resources and support to help you stay on track.
They might also be a better fit for those who prefer a diet plan with more structure, especially as you’re first getting started with your weight loss journey.
Still, keep in mind that not all commercial weight loss programs are safe and effective, especially long term. They can also be expensive and may not be the right fit for everyone.

Our picks for the best diets in 2024
While some people may prefer commercial weight loss programs, there are many other options available that can help you lose weight.
In fact, following a healthy eating pattern might be a better choice for some. In addition to being more budget-friendly, these eating patterns also often offer more flexibility than many commercial weight loss programs.
Here are a few of our top picks to consider:
Mediterranean diet:  The  Mediterranean diet  is inspired by the eating patterns of the Middle East and Mediterranean and  prioritizes  nutritious whole foods. Not only can the Mediterranean diet  lead  to weight loss, but it  may also help prevent  chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.
Plant-based diet:   Plant-based diets  are less restrictive than vegan diets and are  rich in fiber  to keep you  feeling full . Studies show that plant-based diets may be  more effective  for weight loss than conventional diets and may even lead to  greater improvements  in blood sugar, cholesterol, and inflammation.
Low carb diet:   Low carb diets  are often recommended to improve insulin sensitivity and help manage polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) symptoms. Reviews published in  2019  and  2021  found that following a low carb diet could help increase weight loss, balance hormone levels, and improve fertility in people with PCOS.
DASH diet:  The  DASH diet  was specifically designed to support heart health and has been shown to  decrease  blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL (bad) cholesterol, all risk factors for heart disease. Additionally, a  2021 review  showed that the DASH diet could also lead to significant reductions in body weight and belly fat.
MIND diet:  The  MIND diet  may help  support  brain health and preserve brain function as you age, making it a great option for older adults. While limited research is available on the MIND diet for weight management, both the  Mediterranean diet  and  DASH diet  have been associated with increased weight loss.
Vegetarian diet:   Vegetarian diets  emphasize nutrient-dense plant foods and can be easily adapted to fit your personal tastes and preferences. Research suggests that following a vegetarian diet can also be an effective way to  boost  weight loss and  improve  diet quality.
Often, the hardest part of following a diet is figuring out what to cook. But meal delivery services can make it easier than ever to stick to the diet pattern you choose.
