Title: 8 Science-Backed Benefits of Paprika

Paprika is a colorful spice that has vitamin A, capsaicin, and carotenoid antioxidants. These may help prevent inflammation and improve your cholesterol, eye health, and blood sugar levels, among other health benefits.
Paprika is a spice made from the dried peppers of the plant  Capsicum annuum .
It comes in sweet, smoked, and hot varieties, as well as a variety of colors, such as red, orange, and yellow. Paprika is used worldwide, especially in rice dishes and stews.
It’s not only rich in antioxidants but also vitamins and minerals.
Here are 8 science-backed health benefits of paprika.

1. Loaded with nutrients
Paprika is packed with micronutrients and beneficial compounds, with 1 tablespoon (6.8 grams) providing ( 1 ):
Calories:  19
Protein:  less than 1 gram
Fat:  less than 1 gram
Carbs:  4 grams
Fiber:  2 grams
Vitamin  A:  19% of the Daily Value (DV)
Vitamin  E:  13% of the DV
Vitamin  B6:  9% of the DV
Iron:  8% of the DV
Notably, this small amount boasts almost 20% of your daily  vitamin A  needs.
This spice also contains a variety of  antioxidants , which fight cell damage caused by reactive molecules called free radicals.
Free radical damage is linked to chronic illnesses, including heart disease and cancer. As such, eating antioxidant-rich foods may help prevent these conditions ( 2 ).
The main antioxidants in paprika belong to the carotenoid family and include beta carotene, capsanthin, zeaxanthin, and lutein ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ).
Summary  Paprika is rich in  several vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. In particular, 1 tablespoon (6.8  grams) boasts 19% of your daily needs for vitamin A.

2. May promote healthy vision
Paprika contains several nutrients that may boost  eye health , including vitamin E, beta carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin ( 7 ).
In fact, studies have linked a high dietary intake of some of these nutrients to a decreased risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts ( 8 ,  9 ).
In particular,  lutein and zeaxanthin , which act as antioxidants, may prevent damage to your eyes ( 10 ).
In a study in over 1,800 women, those with the highest dietary intakes of lutein and zeaxanthin were 32% less likely to develop cataracts than those with the lowest intakes ( 9 ).
Another study in 4,519 adults likewise noted that higher intakes of lutein and zeaxanthin were associated with a decreased risk of AMD ( 8 ).
Summary  Nutrients in  paprika, particularly lutein and zeaxanthin, have been linked to better eye  health and a lower risk of cataracts and AMD.

3. May reduce inflammation
Certain varieties of paprika, especially hot ones, contain the compound capsaicin ( 11 ,  12 ).
It’s thought that capsaicin binds to receptors on your nerve cells to  reduce inflammation  and pain ( 13 ,  14 ,  15 ).
Therefore, it may protect against a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, including arthritis, nerve damage, and digestive issues ( 13 ,  16 ).
Several studies show that topical creams with capsaicin help reduce pain caused by  arthritis  and nerve damage, but research on capsaicin tablets is more limited ( 13 ).
In a study in 376 adults with gastrointestinal diseases, capsaicin supplements helped prevent stomach inflammation and damage ( 17 ).
Another study in rats revealed that 10 days of capsaicin supplements decreased inflammation associated with an autoimmune nerve condition ( 18 ).
Still, specific research on paprika is needed.
Summary  The  anti-inflammatory compound capsaicin in paprika may treat pain and fight  inflammation associated with a variety of conditions, though more studies are  necessary.

4. May improve your cholesterol levels
Paprika may benefit your cholesterol levels.
In particular, capsanthin, a carotenoid in this popular spice, may raise levels of HDL (good) cholesterol, which is associated with a lower risk of  heart disease  ( 19 ,  20 ,  21 ).
One two-week study found that rats fed diets with paprika and capsanthin experienced significant increases in HDL levels, compared with rats on a control diet ( 20 ).
The carotenoids in paprika may also help  decrease levels  of total and LDL (bad) cholesterol, which are linked to an increased risk of heart disease ( 19 ).
In a 12-week study in 100 healthy adults, those who took a supplement containing 9 mg of paprika carotenoids per day had significantly lower LDL (bad) and total cholesterol levels than those who got a placebo ( 22 ).
Nonetheless, more extensive research is needed.
Summary  Studies suggest  that carotenoids in paprika may help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and  increase HDL (good) cholesterol, thus improving heart health.

5. May have anticancer effects
Numerous compounds in paprika may  protect against cancer .
Several paprika carotenoids, including beta carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin, have been shown to fight oxidative stress, which is thought to increase your risk of certain cancers ( 23 ,  24 ).
Notably, in a study in nearly 2,000 women, those with the highest blood levels of beta carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and total carotenoids were 25–35% less likely to develop breast cancer ( 25 ).
What’s more, capsaicin in paprika may inhibit cancer cell growth and survival by influencing the expression of several genes ( 26 ).
However, more extensive research is needed on this spice’s  anticancer potential .
Summary  Compounds in  paprika, including carotenoids and capsaicin, may block cancer cell growth and  fight oxidative stress related to cancer risk. Yet, more studies are necessary.

6. May improve blood sugar control
The capsaicin in paprika may help manage diabetes.
That’s because capsaicin may influence genes involved in blood sugar control and inhibit enzymes that break down sugar in your body. It may also  improve insulin sensitivity  ( 27 ,  28 ).
In a 4-week study in 42 pregnant women with diabetes, taking a daily 5-mg capsaicin supplement significantly decreased post-meal  blood sugar levels , compared with a placebo ( 29 ).
Another 4-week study in 36 adults found that a diet with capsaicin-containing chili pepper significantly decreased blood insulin levels after meals, compared with a chili-free diet. Lower insulin levels typically indicate better blood sugar control ( 30 ).
Still, further research is necessary.
Summary  The capsaicin in  paprika may help decrease blood sugar and insulin levels, which could be  particularly advantageous for people with diabetes.

7. Important for healthy blood
Paprika is rich in iron and vitamin E, two micronutrients vital for healthy blood.
Iron  is a crucial part of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that helps carry oxygen throughout your body, while vitamin E is needed to create healthy membranes for these cells ( 31 ,  32 ).
Therefore, deficiencies in either of these nutrients may lower your red blood cell count. This can cause anemia, a condition marked by fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath ( 31 ,  32 ,  33 ).
In fact, one study in 200 young women tied low iron intake to a nearly 6-fold increased risk of anemia, compared with adequate intake ( 34 ).
What’s more, animal studies suggest that  vitamin E  is highly effective at repairing damage to red blood cells — and that deficiency in this vitamin may lead to anemia ( 35 ,  32 ).
Summary  Paprika is high in  iron and vitamin E, both of which help create healthy red blood cells and may  work to stave off anemia.

8. Easy to add to your diet
Paprika is a versatile spice that can be incorporated into a multitude of dishes.
It comes in three main varieties that differ in taste and color based on the cultivation and processing of the pepper.
In addition to its sweetness, sweet paprika has a touch of smokiness. It can be used as a seasoning for  meats , potato salad, and eggs.
On the other hand, hot paprika offers a spicier kick and is often added to soups and stews like Hungarian goulash.
Finally, smoked paprika’s sweet, smoky flavor works best with rice, lentil, and bean dishes.
You can also add paprika to simple, everyday meals by sprinkling a dash on  hard-boiled eggs , chopped veggies, dips, cooked rice, roasted potatoes, and salads.
While paprika supplements are likewise available, there’s very limited research on their safety and efficacy.
Summary  The three varieties  of paprika — sweet, hot, and smoked — can be added to meat rubs, soups, eggs,  beans, rice, and many other dishes.

The bottom line
Paprika is a colorful  spice  derived from ground peppers.
It offers a variety of beneficial compounds, including vitamin A, capsaicin, and carotenoid antioxidants. These substances may help prevent inflammation and improve your cholesterol, eye health, and blood sugar levels, among other benefits.
You can add this spice to a variety of dishes, including meats,  vegetables , soups, and eggs.
