Title: 11 Natural Ways to Lower Your Cortisol Levels

You may be able to lower your cortisol levels with regular exercise, adequate sleep, a nutrient-dense diet, and some supplements, like fish oil.
Cortisol is a stress hormone released by the adrenal glands. It helps your body deal with stressful situations, as your brain triggers its release through the sympathetic nervous system — the “fight or flight” system — in response to many different kinds of stress.
While the short-term release of cortisol can help you run quickly from danger, when cortisol levels are  too high  for too long, this can lead to health issues like weight gain and some chronic diseases.
These 11 ways may help naturally lower your cortisol levels.

What happens when cortisol is high?
Moderate to high cortisol levels  may lead to  health issues, such as:
Chronic disease:  Long-term increased cortisol may increase your risk of high blood pressure,  heart disease , type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and other chronic diseases.
Weight gain:  Cortisol  may increase  appetite and signal the body to shift metabolism to store fat.
Lack of energy/difficulty sleeping:  It  can interfere  with sleep hormones, impacting sleep quality and length.
Difficulty concentrating:  High levels may cause “brain fog,” or trouble focusing and lack of mental clarity.
Impaired immune system:  Increased cortisol can make it more difficult for the immune system to fight infections.
Cushing syndrome:  In rare cases, very high cortisol levels can lead to  Cushing syndrome , a rare but serious disease.
Lack of energy:  High cortisol levels can increase feelings of fatigue.
Elevated cortisol levels can also result from underlying issues such as:
chronic stress
medication side effects, including from  prednisone  or hormonal therapy
overactivity or cancer of the pituitary or adrenal glands
Addison disease
Cushing syndrome
obesity
Health professionals can help determine the cause of high cortisol levels and recommend treatment. You can also try some lifestyle habits to help manage cortisol levels.
Here are some recommendations:

1. Get the right amount of sleep
Prioritizing sleep may help reduce cortisol levels. Chronic sleep issues such as obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, or shift work are associated with higher cortisol.
Insomnia refers to difficulty sleeping. It can result from many things, including stress and obstructive  sleep apnea . This can  increase  circulating cortisol, which affects your daily hormone patterns, energy levels, and other facets of your health.
Those on rotating shifts  may have  poorer health outcomes, such as:
obesity
heart disease
type 2 diabetes
worsened mental health
If you are a night shift or rotating shift worker, you do not have complete control over your sleep schedule, but there are some things you can do to  optimize sleep :
Have a bedtime routine:  Establishing a consistent bedtime routine (e.g., shower, read a book, etc.) can help your brain and body start winding down.
Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day:  A regular sleep schedule is one of the most effective ways to improve sleep.
Exercise   earlier in the day:  Exercising regularly can improve sleep quality but should be done at least 2–3 hours before bedtime.
Limit caffeine intake:  Avoid consuming caffeine-containing food and drinks around 6 hours before bed.
Avoid nicotine and alcohol:  Both substances can affect sleep quality and duration.
Limit exposure to bright light at night:  Around 45–60 minutes before sleep, reduce your exposure to bright and blue light. Instead of reaching for your phone in bed, try reading a book or listening to a podcast.
Go to bed in a quiet room:  Limit interruptions using white noise, ear plugs, and silencing your phone.
Take naps:  If shift work shortens your sleep, napping can reduce sleepiness and prevent a sleep deficit. Napping may worsen sleep quality in non-shift workers, especially if you take naps within  7 hours  of bedtime.
Practicing good sleep hygiene can help to keep cortisol in a normal rhythm. Keeping a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine 6 hours before bed, and staying off your cell phone right before bed are effective strategies.

2. Get regular exercise
Exercise  can increase or decrease cortisol depending on the intensity.
Intense exercise  increases  cortisol shortly afterward but decreases it a few hours later. This short-term increase helps coordinate the growth of the body to meet the challenge. Additionally, the size of the cortisol response lessens with routine training.
Regular exercise can help reduce your risk of chronic disease, reduce stress, and improve overall health, according to the  National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease (NIDDK) . This can help lower cortisol over time.
Regular exercise  may lead to  greater resilience to acute stress and may lower adverse health effects associated with stress, such as high cortisol.
That said, overdoing it can have the opposite effect. Aim for around 150–200 minutes of mostly low- to moderate-intensity exercise each week, and allow yourself time to rest between workouts.
Exercising regularly can help you better manage stress and promote good health, which may help lower cortisol levels. Aim for around 150–200 minutes of low- to moderate-intensity exercise each week.

3. Learn to recognize stressful thinking
Adding a  mindfulness-based practice  to your daily routine may help you manage stress and reduce cortisol levels.
Mindfulness-based stress reduction is a strategy that involves becoming more self-aware of stress-provoking thoughts, accepting them without judgment or resistance, and allowing yourself to process them.
Training yourself to be aware of your thoughts, breathing, heart rate, and other signs of tension helps you recognize  stress  when it begins.
By focusing on awareness of your mental and physical state, you can become an objective observer of your stressful thoughts without judging.
Recognizing stressful thoughts allows you to formulate a conscious and deliberate reaction to them. For example, a  study  involving 52 older adults with type 2 diabetes in a mindfulness-based program showed that mindfulness training improved anxiety, stress, depression, and cortisol levels after the intervention.
Another study  suggests that regularly practicing mindfulness may lower cortisol levels in people with generalized anxiety disorder.
Practicing mindfulness can help you identify stressful thoughts and better manage them. Mindfulness-based practices such as meditation may help you reduce stress and lead to lower cortisol levels.

4. Breathe
Deep breathing is a technique for stress reduction that can be used anywhere. Like mindfulness-based practice, controlled breathing  helps stimulate  the parasympathetic nervous system, known as the “rest and digest” system, which helps lower  cortisol levels .
Incorporating belly or  diaphragmatic breathing  can help decrease stress and cortisol levels, according to a  2019 review of research .
This practice is popular in mindfulness-based practices such as meditation,  yoga ,  tai chi, and qi gong , which place a strong emphasis on breathing and mind-body connection.
These practices can help to lower cortisol and stress.
Deep breathing stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for relaxation and lower cortisol levels. Meditation, yoga, tai chi, and qi gong can help.

5. Have fun and laugh
Laughing promotes the release of endorphins and  suppresses  stress hormones such as cortisol. It’s also  linked with  better mood, reduced stress and perceived pain, lower blood pressure, and a stronger immune system.
Both authentic and forced laughter  can lead to  lower levels of stress.
For example,  laughing yoga  — a form of yoga that promotes deliberate bouts of laughter —  may help :
lower cortisol levels
reduce stress
improve mood
increase perceived energy levels
Developing hobbies can also promote feelings of well-being, which may translate to lower cortisol. This can include:
gardening
listening to music
dancing
Tending to your own happiness can help keep cortisol down. If you’re feeling stressed, try listening to music or making yourself laugh.

6. Maintain healthy relationships
Supportive relationships can translate to lower cortisol levels, according to a 2017  review of research .
Within couples, conflict  results  in a short-term elevation in cortisol, followed by a return to normal levels.
A  2016 study  of conflict styles in 88 couples found nonjudgmental mindfulness led to a more rapid return of cortisol to normal levels following an argument. Therefore, practicing compassion and empathy toward your partner — and receiving it back — may better manage your cortisol levels.
Support from loved ones can also help reduce cortisol in the face of stress.
For example,  one older study  showed that having an affectionate interaction (verbally or physically) with a romantic partner or platonic friend before a stressful activity resulted in lower stress-induced markers such as heart rate and blood pressure.
Relationships with friends and family can lead to happiness and to stress. Spend time with those you love and learn to forgive and manage conflict for better emotional and physical health.

7. Take care of a pet
Relationships with animal companions can also reduce cortisol.
In one  older study , interaction with a therapy dog reduced distress and cortisol during a minor medical procedure in children.  A review of research  that looked at more recent studies did not find noticeable differences in cortisol levels in participants’ saliva but noted other evidence of reduced stress and anxiety.
Due to the well-known stress-reducing benefits of pets, many long-term care homes and university/college campuses have introduced pet therapy as a natural cortisol- and stress-reducing activity.
Several studies show that interacting with an animal companion reduces stress and lowers cortisol levels. Even if you do not own a pet, interacting with another person’s pet can reap similar benefits.

8. Be your best self
Feelings of shame, guilt, or inadequacy can lead to negative thinking and dysregulated cortisol levels.
This  can include  feeling stigmatized based on personal factors, such as weight, sexual orientation, and race, among others. While you cannot directly control the  stigma  surrounding these individual factors, you may be able to take steps to help  manage your feelings  in response to stigma.
For some causes of guilt, fixing the source will mean making a change in your life. For other causes, learning to  forgive and accept yourself  and others can help you move on and improve your sense of well-being.
Developing a habit of forgiving others is also critical in relationships. It  can have  numerous health benefits for both your physical and psychological health.
Resolving guilt improves life satisfaction and cortisol levels. This may involve changing habits, forgiving others, or learning to forgive yourself.

9. Tend to your spirituality
Developing your faith can also help improve cortisol levels if you consider yourself spiritual.
Older research  suggests that adults who expressed spiritual faith experienced lower cortisol levels in the face of life stressors such as illness.
Prayer may  also help  reduce stress, anxiety, and depression.
If you do not consider yourself spiritual, these benefits  may also  be available through  meditation , developing a social support group, and performing acts of kindness.
For those with spiritual inclinations, developing faith and participating in prayer can help manage cortisol. Whether you’re spiritual or not, performing acts of kindness can also improve your cortisol levels.

10. Eat a nutritious diet
While all foods can be enjoyed in moderation, being mindful of the foods you eat may relieve symptoms of stress and help you better manage your cortisol levels.
Regular  high added sugar intake  may result in elevated cortisol levels. Interestingly, a diet high in sugar may also suppress cortisol release during stressful events, making it more difficult for your body to handle stressful situations.
One study  found that a diet high in added sugar, refined grains, and saturated fat led to significantly higher cortisol levels than a diet high in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and polyunsaturated fats.
Research  has shown a strong relationship between a healthy gut microbiome — all the microbes living in your gut — and improved mental health. Therefore, consuming foods to support a healthy gut may help reduce stress and anxiety and improve overall health.
Other foods  that help  manage cortisol include:
Dark chocolate:  Dark chocolate contains many flavonoids, which  may buffer  stress reactivity in the adrenal glands, resulting in lower cortisol release.
Whole grains:  Unlike refined grains, whole grains are rich in plant-based polyphenols and fiber, which  may support  stress levels and gut health.
Whole fruits and vegetables:  Whole fruits and vegetables contain many antioxidants and polyphenolic compounds that fight cell-damaging free radicals and  may help  reduce cortisol levels.
Legumes and lentils:  High in fiber, they support a healthy gut while managing blood sugar levels.
Green tea:  Green tea  contains  catechins, other polyphenols, and a calming compound known as L-theanine, which has been linked to reduced stress and increased mental alertness.
Probiotics and prebiotics:   Probiotics  are friendly, symbiotic bacteria in foods such as yogurt, sauerkraut, and kimchi. Prebiotics, such as soluble fiber, provide food for these bacteria. Both probiotics and prebiotics are linked to better gut and mental health.
Healthy fats:  A diet high in unsaturated fat and low in saturated fat is associated with better overall health and mental well-being. In particular, omega-3 fatty acids are best linked with brain health and reduced stress. Good sources include fatty fish, nuts, and seeds.
Water:  Dehydration  can temporarily  increase cortisol levels, making drinking water throughout the day even more important.
For better gut and mental health, opt for a nutrient-dense diet full of whole fruits and vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, and foods high in prebiotics and probiotics.

11. Take certain supplements
In addition to a nutrient-dense diet, certain supplements may also support lower cortisol levels.
Fish oil is one of the best sources of  omega-3 fatty acids , which are thought to reduce cortisol.
A longitudinal  cohort study  involving 2,724 participants showed that having high omega-3 levels in the blood was associated with lower levels of inflammation and cortisol.
Though you can get omega-3s from fish, you can also opt for a  fish oil supplement . You can speak with a healthcare professional first to  ensure it’s right for you .
Ashwagandha  is an adaptogen herb widely used in traditional medicine to treat anxiety and help people adapt to stress.
A randomized controlled trial  in 60 adults showed reduced cortisol levels after taking 250 or 600 mg of ashwagandha extract for 8 weeks, while the control group showed no significant changes.
Other  research  suggests ashwagandha extract may be effective in reducing cortisol levels and reducing symptoms of anxiety. That said, larger studies are still needed.
If you want to try ashwagandha, be sure it’s from a company with third-party verification. Speaking with a healthcare professional before taking any new supplements is best.
Fish oil and ashwagandha extract may help reduce anxiety and cortisol levels in the body, though more research is still needed.
