Title: 8 Home Remedies for Acid Reflux and GERD

Home remedies, including sitting up after eating and eating certain foods, may help relieve sporadic heartburn. But it occurs often, a doctor may recommend a prescription medication.
Occasional heartburn (acid reflux) can happen to anyone.
If you experience  acid reflux  more than twice per week, you may have  gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) . In this case, heartburn is just one of many symptoms, along with  coughing  and  chest pain .
GERD is typically treated with  over-the-counter (OTC) medications , such as  antacids , and lifestyle or dietary measures. In severe cases, prescription medications may be needed to prevent damage to the  esophagus .
While medication is the most common form of GERD treatment, there are some home remedies you can try to reduce instances of acid reflux. Talk with a  gastroenterologist  about the following options.

1. Manage your weight
While heartburn can happen to anyone, GERD seems to be most prevalent in adults who are overweight or  obese .
Excess weight  — especially in the abdominal area — puts more pressure on the  stomach . As a result, you’re at an increased risk of stomach acids working back into the esophagus and causing heartburn.
Manage your weight with a  balanced diet  and  regular exercise . Speak with your doctor if losing weight may be an option for helping GERD symptoms.

2. Know which foods and drinks to avoid
There are certain  known trigger foods and drinks  that can increase your risk for acid reflux. With GERD, you should be especially wary of items that can lead to symptoms. Try avoiding  the following foods and beverages :
tomato sauce and other tomato-based products
high fat foods, such as  fast food products  and greasy foods
fried foods
citrus fruit juices
soda
caffeine
chocolate
garlic
onions
mint
alcohol
By limiting or avoiding these triggers, you may experience fewer symptoms. You may also want to keep a food journal to help identify problem foods.

3. Eat a little, sit up a little longer
Eating smaller meals puts less pressure on the stomach, which can prevent the backflow of stomach acids. By eating smaller amounts of food more frequently, you can reduce heartburn  and  eat fewer calories overall.
It’s also important to avoid lying down after eating. Doing so can trigger heartburn.
The  National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)  recommends elevating your head with pillows to avoid nighttime heartburn.

4. Eat foods that help
No one magic food can treat acid reflux. Still, in addition to avoiding trigger foods, a few other dietary changes can help.
First, the  American Academy of Family Physicians  recommends low fat,  high protein  meals. Reducing dietary fat intake can decrease your symptoms while getting enough  protein  and  fiber  will keep you full and prevent overeating.
Try incorporating some foods into your diet to help your acid reflux.  After each meal, you may even consider  chewing non-mint gum . This can help increase saliva and keep acid out of the esophagus.

5. Quit smoking
If you smoke and have heartburn or GERD, quitting  smoking  can help your condition.
Smoking damages the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which is responsible for preventing stomach acids from backing up. When the muscles of the LES are weakened from smoking, you may experience more frequent heartburn episodes.
Secondhand smoke  can also be problematic if you have acid reflux or GERD.
Here are some tips to help you quit smoking.

6. Explore potential herbal remedies
The following herbs have been used for GERD:
chamomile
licorice
marshmallow
slippery elm
These are available in supplement and tincture form, as well as  teas .
The downside to these herbs is that there aren’t enough studies to prove they can treat GERD. Furthermore, they might interfere with medications you may take — check with a doctor before use.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t monitor herbs and supplements.
However, personal testimonials report that herbs can be a natural and effective way to reduce the symptoms of GERD. Be sure to purchase herbs from a reputable source.

7. Avoid tight clothing
You should feel free to wear what you want — though tight clothing may worsen GERD symptoms.
Wearing clothes that are too tight can increase acid reflux episodes. This is especially the case with tight bottoms and belts: Both place unnecessary pressure on the abdomen, thereby contributing to heartburn risk. If you notice heartburn symptoms, try incorporating looser clothing into your wardrobe.

8. Try relaxation techniques
GERD itself can be very stressful. Since esophageal muscles play a large role in keeping stomach acids down where they belong, it may help to learn techniques that can relax both your body and mind.
Yoga  has enormous benefits by promoting mind-body awareness. If you’re not a yogi, you can try quiet  meditation  and  deep breathing  for a few minutes several times a day to tame your stress levels.

Certain herbal teas, low fat or plant-based milk, non-citrus fruit juice, coconut water, and sometimes just regular water may help reduce your acid reflux symptoms. Learn  what to drink for acid reflux .
If you have temporary heartburn related to something you are or a mild form of GERD, your acid reflux may go away on its own after a few hours. In more serious cases, you may need medication and lifestyle changes to manage your symptoms.

Outlook
Home remedies can help alleviate the occasional heartburn episode, as well as some cases of GERD. When prolonged, untreated acid reflux occurs, you have a higher risk of esophageal damage. This can include  ulcers , a  narrowed esophagus , and even  esophageal cancer .
These remedies alone may not work for acid reflux and GERD. Talk with a gastroenterologist about how some of these remedies may complement a medical treatment plan.
