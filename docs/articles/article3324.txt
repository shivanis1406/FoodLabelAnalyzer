How to make Taco Bell meals more keto-friendly
Here are a few more tips to help you make Taco Bell fit your  keto diet :
Nix the tortilla, chips, and beans.  These are the highest-carb items in most Taco Bell meals, so avoiding them will effortlessly make most of the Taco Bell menu keto-friendly, with the exception of desserts and sugary drinks ( 2 ,  6 ,  7 ).
Add guacamole.  Taco Bell offers guacamole, which contains fat and fiber from the  avocado  it’s made with. This is a great addition to your keto Taco Bell order because it adds fat, fiber, and calories without adding lots of net carbs ( 8 ).
Add sauces.  Taco Bell offers a variety of sauces that are all low in carbs. These include hot sauces, cheese sauce, reduced fat sour cream, and creamy sauces like their Jalapeno Ranch Sauce. They’re a great way to add flavor and extra fat and calories ( 9 ,  10 ).
Ask for extra meat or cheese.  To get an extra dose of  protein  and fat in your meal, ask for extra meat or cheese. Note that Taco Bell meats do contain small amounts of carbs from their seasonings and additives ( 5 ,  11 ).
Get your order over lettuce.  Most of these keto-friendly options will be served in bowls, so you can ask for the whole meal to be served over lettuce to add bulk without too many extra carbs. You can also add tomatoes, onions, or jalapeños ( 5 ).
Remember to use the nutrition calculator on their website, as well. It allows you to totally customize your order, including the ability to remove tortillas and view the nutrition information.

Focus on unprocessed foods
It’s important to note that Taco Bell is probably not the best food to eat regularly.
Although you can make lots of Taco Bell menu items keto-friendly, they’re still highly processed — and highly processed foods appear to contribute to excess weight gain, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic health conditions much more than unprocessed foods ( 12 ).
Taco Bell is a great option in a pinch or every once in a while, but try not to make it a regular part of your diet.
Overall, focus on a keto diet that’s based on unprocessed,  whole foods .

The bottom line
Most Taco Bell menu items aren’t keto friendly when ordered as-is, but a few simple changes can reduce the net carb count to an acceptable 10 grams or fewer.
To make nearly any item at Taco Bell keto, ask for it without:
tortillas
beans
chips
To add extra fat, protein, and calories, ask for:
extra meat
guacamole
sour cream
cheese
creamy sauce
To bulk up your meal without adding lots of extra carbs, add:
lettuce
tomato
onion
jalapeños.
Just remember, even the keto-friendly foods at Taco Bell are still highly processed, so try to have Taco Bell and other fast food meals only occasionally.
Try this today:  If you know a fast food visit is in your future, check out the restaurant’s website in advance and plan your meal before arriving. That way, you’ll know for sure that what you order fits your dietary needs.
