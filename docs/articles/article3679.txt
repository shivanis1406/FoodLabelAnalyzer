Title: Foods You Can Eat on a Gluten-Free Diet

Most whole, unprocessed foods fit into a gluten-free diet. However, certain additives can turn a supposed gluten-free food into one that may affect people with conditions like celiac disease.
Gluten is a group of proteins found in certain grains, such as wheat, rye, and barley. It helps food  maintain its shape  by providing elasticity and moisture. It also allows bread to rise and provides a chewy texture.
Although gluten is safe for most people, those with conditions like celiac disease should  avoid it  to prevent adverse health effects.
Many foods are made with gluten-containing ingredients. As such, if you’re unable to consume gluten it’s important to check ingredient labels closely, or only purchase products that are certified gluten-free.
This article provides a list of 84 gluten-free foods. However, some foods may have  trace amounts  of gluten if they’re processed in the same warehouse as gluten-containing foods.

Ingredients to look out for
Here is a  list of ingredients and food additives  that may indicate an item contains gluten:
modified food starch and maltodextrin (if made from wheat, it will be specified on the label)
malt-based ingredients, including malt vinegar, malt extract, and malt syrup
gluten stabilizer
soy or teriyaki sauce
wheat-based ingredients, such as wheat protein and wheat flour
emulsifiers (will be specified on the label)
If you’re unsure if a product contains gluten, it’s a good idea to contact the manufacturer to double-check.

Conditions that can be helped by a gluten-free diet
A  gluten-free diet  is typically recommended for those with  celiac disease . This condition  triggers  an immune response when foods containing gluten are consumed.
People with  non-celiac gluten sensitivity  may also have to limit gluten, as it can  contribute  to  symptoms  like bloating, stomach pain, and diarrhea.
Some  research  suggests that a gluten-free diet may be beneficial for those with  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . This is a chronic disorder characterized by digestive issues like stomach pain, gas, diarrhea, and constipation.
That said, more research is needed to fully understand the role of gluten in IBS.

Risks of a gluten-free diet
Gluten is found naturally in many nutritious foods, including whole grains like wheat, barley, and rye.
Research  shows that there’s no benefit to gain from following a gluten-free diet for non-medically indicated reasons. This means that if you haven’t received a diagnosis of celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or a healthcare professional hasn’t advised you to stop eating gluten, then you may not gain benefits.
In fact, following a gluten-free diet without the need to may  increase your risk  of  nutrient deficiencies .
Some processed, gluten-free food products are not enriched with vitamins and minerals. As such, following a gluten-free diet that lacks diversity  could increase  the risk of nutrient deficiencies in:
fiber
folate
riboflavin
niacin
iron
Therefore, it’s essential to ensure that you’re getting these important nutrients from other sources as part of a well-rounded, gluten-free diet to help reduce the risk of side effects.
