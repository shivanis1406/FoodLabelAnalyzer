Title: What to Know About Berberine for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)

Berberine is an herbal supplement that naturally occurs in the roots and bark of various plants. It may help treat symptoms of PCOS by supporting weight management and healthy blood sugar levels.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition that affects hormones. It’s estimated to affect between  3% and 10%  of reproductive-aged women worldwide.
Although there’s currently no cure for PCOS, there are a variety of conventional and holistic treatment options available to help manage symptoms.
Berberine is a popular herbal supplement that may help treat PCOS. We explore what berberine is and whether it’s effective for PCOS symptoms.

What is berberine?
Berberine is the primary active compound in a plant known as Rhizoma coptidis. This plant has been  used to treat  inflammation and bacterial infections in traditional Chinese medicine practices for centuries.
Many commercial  berberine supplements  are extracted from  barberry  shrubs, but they  may also  be derived from other plants, including Oregon grape, goldenseal, and tree turmeric.
Today, berberine is frequently used as an alternative to conventional medications. It may help manage symptoms associated with PCOS, as well as various symptoms that increase your risk of heart disease and diabetes, such as:
high blood sugar
insulin resistance
high cholesterol
high blood pressure
obesity

Possible benefits of berberine for people with PCOS
Early research suggests berberine may be an effective alternative or complementary therapy for certain physiological symptoms of PCOS.
It’s estimated that  up to 80%  of people with PCOS have  insulin resistance . If left untreated, insulin resistance can eventually develop into type 2 diabetes.
According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , more than 50% of people with PCOS develop type 2 diabetes by the time they reach age 40.
Research from 2017  suggests berberine may play a role in treating insulin resistance by increasing your body’s production and activity of certain compounds that are responsible for aiding carb metabolism and insulin sensitivity.
A  2020 research review  that included over 1,000 women found that berberine was significantly more effective at improving insulin sensitivity and reducing blood sugar than a placebo.
What’s more, berberine’s effects were comparable to that of a popular conventional medication known as  metformin .
PCOS  can increase  a person’s tendency to accumulate excess body fat, particularly around the midsection. This is thought to be caused by a combination of increased testosterone levels and insulin resistance.
Research from 2017  suggests that berberine may promote  healthy weight management  due to its ability to stimulate the redistribution of fatty tissue and reduce the body’s tendency to store additional fat.
Although the results are promising, more research is needed to determine how berberine may affect weight gain and fat distribution in larger PCOS populations.
People with PCOS have an increased risk of developing heart disease, and berberine  may play  a role in reducing certain heart disease risk factors.
A  2020 research review  on berberine’s ability to treat PCOS found that berberine  lowered triglycerides  and LDL (bad) cholesterol while raising HDL (good) cholesterol.
Ultimately, more well-designed studies are needed to better understand how berberine may be used to support heart health in people with PCOS.

Dosage
Berberine is usually consumed in capsule form but it’s also available in liquid and powder formulations.
Due to a lack of robust data, there’s currently no consensus regarding the most appropriate dosage of berberine for PCOS.
Several studies have safely used daily doses between 500 micrograms (mcg) divided into 2 to 3 servings, ideally taken with meals.
If you’re interested in trying berberine to manage your PCOS symptoms, consider speaking with a healthcare professional first. They can advise you on whether it’s the right choice for you, as well as suggest an appropriate dosage.

Safety precautions and possible side effects
Berberine ranks quite well in terms of safety, yet it’s not risk-free.
The most  commonly reported  side effects are:
nausea
diarrhea
stomachaches
gas
headache
However, these side effects are typically mild.
In certain countries, such as the United States, herbal supplements are not regulated to the same degree as medications. This is why it’s important to choose high quality supplements that have been tested for purity and potency by a third-party organization like  NSF International  or  US Pharmacopeia .
Although berberine is often taken by people who are trying to become pregnant, it should be avoided by anyone who is pregnant or nursing.
If you’re considering adding berberine — or any other supplement — to your wellness routine, consult a healthcare professional to ensure it’s right for you. Berberine can  interact with several medications , such as those for blood clotting, high blood pressure, and diabetes.
