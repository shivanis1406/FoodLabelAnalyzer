Title: 11 Healthy Eating Accounts Worth Following on Social Media

The adage “put good in, get good out” doesn’t just apply to the food you put in your body — it’s true for what you take in on social media, too.
Just like eating nutrient-rich foods yields positive physical results, a “diet” of social accounts that inspire and encourage can move you forward in your journey toward a healthier life.
That said, social media is famous for showcasing unrealistic images of health.
Whether it’s images of unattainable bodies or no-leaf-out-of-place salads, many social media accounts can make you feel like a healthy lifestyle is only for a select few.
However, this couldn’t be further from the truth.
Instead of following accounts that leave you feeling discouraged, you can choose to subscribe to folks who demonstrate real-world ways to eat well while having honest conversations about the challenges of doing so.
