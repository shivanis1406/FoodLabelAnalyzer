Title: How Your Gut Bacteria Can Influence Your Weight



Your body contains trillions of bacteria.
The majority of these bacteria are located in your intestines.
Gut bacteria play several important roles in your health, such as communicating with your immune system and producing certain vitamins.
Your gut bacteria can also affect how different foods are digested and produce chemicals that help make you feel full. As a result, they can affect your weight.
This article explains how your gut bacteria affect your weight and what foods promote healthy gut bacteria growth.

What Are Gut Bacteria?
Trillions of bacteria and microorganisms live on your skin and in your body ( 1 ,  2 ).
In fact, there are likely more bacterial cells in your body than human cells.
It is estimated that in a 154-pound (70-kg) man, there are around 40 trillion bacterial cells and only 30 trillion human cells ( 3 ).
Most of these bacteria live in a part of your large intestine called the cecum.
There are hundreds of different types of bacteria in your intestines. While some may cause disease, most of them carry out essential tasks to  keep you healthy  ( 4 ).
For example, your gut bacteria produce certain vitamins, including vitamin K, and communicate with your immune system to help your body fight off infection ( 5 ,  6 ).
They also influence how you digest certain foods and produce chemicals that help make you feel full. Therefore, your gut bacteria may influence your weight ( 7 ,  8 ).
Summary  Your body contains more bacterial cells than human cells. These bacteria are  primarily located in your intestines and carry out essential tasks to keep you  healthy.

They Affect How Your Food Is Digested
Since your gut bacteria line your intestines, they come into contact with the food you eat. This may affect what nutrients you absorb and how energy is stored in your body.
One study examined the gut bacteria in 77 pairs of twins, one of whom had obesity and one of whom did not.
The study found that those who had obesity had different gut bacteria than their twins without obesity. In particular, obesity was associated with lower gut bacteria diversity, meaning there were fewer types of bacteria in the gut ( 9 ).
Other studies have shown that if the gut bacteria from people with obesity are put into mice, the mice gain weight. This suggests that gut bacteria could affect weight ( 10 ,  11 ).
This may be due to the effect of bacteria on the digestion of different foods.
For example, humans can’t digest fiber but certain gut bacteria can. By digesting fiber, these gut bacteria produce a number of chemicals that benefit gut health and possibly promote weight loss ( 12 ).
For example, a number of studies have shown that people with high  fiber intake  have a lower weight, which may be due to the role that gut bacteria play in digesting fiber ( 13 ,  14 ,  15 ).
A recent study found that the ratio of two types of bacteria in your intestines may determine how much weight you lose when given a particular diet.
These two bacteria are  Prevotella , which digests fiber and carbohydrates, and  Bacteroidetes , which people who eat more animal protein and fat have more of ( 16 ).
In this study, 62 people were given a high-fiber, whole grain diet for 26 weeks. Those who had more  Prevotella  in their intestines lost 5.1 pounds (2.3 kg) more body fat than those with more  Bacteroidetes  in their intestines ( 17 ).
Your gut bacteria also digest certain antioxidants found in plants known as flavonoids, which may help prevent weight gain ( 18 ).
Finally, your gut bacteria can influence how dietary fats are absorbed in the intestines, which may affect how fat is stored in the body ( 19 ).
Summary  Your gut bacteria may affect your weight by influencing how different foods are  digested in your body. Dietary fiber is digested by certain species of gut  bacteria, which may aid weight loss.

They Affect Inflammation
Inflammation occurs when your body activates your immune system to fight infection.
It can also be caused by an  unhealthy diet . For example, a diet containing too much fat, sugar or calories can lead to elevated inflammatory chemicals in the bloodstream and fat tissue, which may contribute to weight gain ( 20 ,  21 ).
Your gut bacteria play an important role in inflammation. Some species produce chemicals like lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which cause inflammation when they pass into the blood.
When mice are given LPS, they gain as much weight and have similar increases in blood sugar and insulin as mice fed a high-fat diet ( 22 ).
Therefore, certain gut bacteria that produce LPS and cause inflammation may contribute to weight gain and  insulin resistance .
A study in 292 people found that those who were overweight had lower gut bacteria diversity and higher levels of C-reactive protein, an inflammatory marker in the blood ( 23 ).
However, some species of intestinal bacteria may reduce inflammation and prevent weight gain.
Bifidobacteria and  Akkermansia  are beneficial species of bacteria that help maintain a healthy gut barrier and prevent inflammatory chemicals from passing from the gut into the bloodstream ( 24 ).
Studies in mice have found that  Akkermansia  can reduce weight gain and insulin resistance by reducing inflammation ( 25 ).
Similarly, when mice were fed prebiotic fibers to help increase  Bifidobacteria  in the gut, weight gain and insulin resistance decreased without affecting energy intake ( 26 ).
This is a relatively new area of research. Therefore, it is still not clear how gut bacteria affect inflammation and weight in humans.
Summary  Certain types of gut bacteria are essential for maintaining a healthy gut  barrier and preventing inflammation, which can contribute to weight gain.

They Produce Chemicals That Help You Feel Hungry or Full
Your body produces a number of different hormones that affect your appetite, including  leptin ,  ghrelin , peptide YY (PYY).
Some studies have shown that different bacteria in the gut can affect how much of these hormones are produced and whether you feel hungry or full ( 27 ,  28 ).
Short-chain fatty acids  are chemicals that are produced when certain species of gut bacteria break down fiber. One of these is known as propionate.
One study in 60 overweight adults found that taking propionate for 24 weeks significantly increased levels of the hormones PYY and GLP-1, both of which influence hunger.
People who took propionate also had reduced food intake and reduced weight gain ( 29 ).
Other studies have shown that prebiotics supplements, which contain compounds that are fermented by gut bacteria, can have a similar effect on appetite ( 30 ).
People who ate 16 grams of prebiotics per day for two weeks had higher levels of hydrogen in their breath. This indicates gut bacterial fermentation, less hunger and higher levels of the hormones GLP-1 and PYY, which make you feel full ( 31 ).
Summary  Your  gut bacteria can produce chemicals that can help make you feel full. By  affecting your appetite, your gut bacteria may play a role in your weight.

The Best and Worst Foods for Your Gut Bacteria
A number of different foods are  good for gut bacteria , including:
Whole grains:   Whole  grains  are grains that haven’t been refined. They’re high in fiber, which is digested by healthy gut bacteria like  Bifidobacteria  and may aid weight loss ( 32 ).
Fruits and vegetables:   Fruits  and vegetables contain many different fibers that are  good for gut bacteria. Eating an assortment of plant-based foods can improve  gut bacteria diversity, which is linked to a healthy weight ( 33 ).
Nuts and seeds:   Nuts  and seeds also contain lots of fiber and healthy  fats, which help support the growth of healthy bacteria in the gut ( 34 ).
Polyphenol-rich foods:  These include dark chocolate, green tea and red wine.  The  polyphenols  in these foods can’t be digested alone but are broken  down by beneficial gut bacteria, promoting the growth of good bacteria ( 35 ).
Fermented foods:   Fermented  foods  include yogurt, kombucha, kefir and sauerkraut. They contain beneficial bacteria like lactobacilli and can minimize  other disease-causing bacteria in the intestines ( 36 ).
Probiotics:   Probiotics  aren’t necessary all of the time, but they can help  restore healthy gut bacteria after an illness or course of antibiotics and may  even aid weight loss ( 37 ).
On the other hand, eating some foods in excess may  harm gut your bacteria , including:
Sugary foods:  A diet  high in  sugar  can stimulate the growth of certain unhealthy bacteria in the gut,  which may contribute to weight gain and other chronic health disorders ( 38 ).
Artificial sweeteners:   Artificial  sweeteners  such as aspartame and saccharin reduce beneficial bacteria in the intestines, which may  contribute to high blood sugar ( 39 ).
Foods containing unhealthy fats:   Healthy  fats  such as omega-3s support beneficial bacteria in the intestines, whereas too many saturated fats may contribute to the  growth of disease-causing bacteria ( 40 ,  41 ).
Summary  Whole grains, fruits, vegetables and fermented foods all support healthy gut  bacteria, while too many sugary foods, artificial sweeteners and unhealthy fats  can be bad for your gut bacteria.

The Bottom Line
Your body contains trillions of bacteria that influence your health in many ways.
Your gut bacteria can affect how your food is digested, how fat is stored and whether you feel hungry or full.
Thus, a healthy gut bacteria may be important for maintaining a healthy weight.
High-fiber foods like whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds can all promote healthy gut bacteria.
