Title: 14 Best Breakfast Foods for People with Diabetes

If you have diabetes, coming up with breakfast options may be challenging. Read on for nutritious, tasty, and filling breakfast ideas.
If you have  diabetes , you typically need to manage your blood sugar levels. This includes managing how many carbs you consume.
Opt for foods that are rich in protein and fiber, contain healthy fats, and provide low to moderate amounts of carbs.
Here are 14 great breakfast ideas for people with diabetes.

1. Eggs
Eggs  are delicious and versatile.
A 2021 study  found that eggs are an affordable source of nutrients. Additionally, the study suggests they can be safely consumed by those with diabetes.
They’re low in calories and contain a lot of protein. A large egg  contains  the following:
Calories:  71.5
Protein:  6.3 grams (g)
Fat:  4.76 g
Carbs:  0.36 g
Fiber:  0 g
You can enjoy eggs in various ways, such as fried, poached, or scrambled. Alternatively, you could make a healthy and delicious omelet with a variety of vegetables like spinach, mushroom, and bell peppers.
Eggs have a lot of protein, moderate fat, and low carb content. You can enjoy them in various ways, such as fried, poached, scrambled, or as an omelet.

2. Greek yogurt with blueberries
Greek yogurt with berries is an easy, tasty, and nutritious breakfast option.
According to  a 2020 study , eating yogurt fortified with probiotics, in addition to vitamin D or calcium, may help you manage diabetes.
A 7-ounce (oz), or 200 g, serving of low fat  Greek yogurt  with 1/2 cup (75 g) of  blue berries  contains the following:
Calories:  188.2
Protein:  20.4 g
Fat:  4 g
Carbs:  18.63 g
Fiber:  1.77 g
This dish is relatively low in calories. You can also add a tablespoon of crushed or slivered nuts for a boost in calories and healthy fats without significantly increasing the carb content.
Greek yogurt with berries is a nutritious breakfast option. It may improve blood sugar management, partly due to the probiotics found in yogurt.

3. Blueberry chia pudding
Chia seeds are suitable for people with diabetes. This is because they have a lot of fiber and healthy omega-3 fatty acids while also being low in digestible carbs. Digestible carbs are used by your body and raise blood sugar levels.
Even though a 1-oz (28-g) serving contains 12 g of carbs, 9.8 g come from fiber, so it may not raise your blood sugar levels.
According to  researchers , soluble fiber — which is found in chia seeds — may help lower your blood sugar levels. It does this by slowing the speed at which food moves through your gut and is absorbed into the bloodstream.
You can also add in fruit and nuts to make it more nourishing. Try making this  blueberry chia pudding . You’ll need a blender, and you can also swap out the cashew milk for any milk of your choosing. This recipe makes 3 servings.
One serving contains:
Calories:  350
Protein:  13 g
Fat:  24 g
Carbs:  14 g
Fiber:  16 g

12. Sausage, mushroom, and zucchini frittata
You can make a frittata using chicken, beef, or pork sausage.
Recent  research  suggests that eating red meat does not affect type 2 diabetes risk factors such as insulin sensitivity and fasting glucose. However, the  American Diabetes Association  recommends limiting red meat, as it contains more saturated fat than other meats.
