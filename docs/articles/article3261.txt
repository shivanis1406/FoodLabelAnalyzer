Title: Green Tea vs Black Tea: Which One Is Healthier?

Green and black tea have similar health benefits, such as boosting alertness and protecting heart and brain health. Both are high in antioxidants but differ in their components. One isn’t necessarily “healthier” than the other.
Both green and black tea are made from the leaves of the  Camellia sinensis  plant.
One difference is that black tea leaves are first rolled and  then oxidized  (exposed to air), whereas green tea is unoxidized. This reaction causes black tea leaves to turn dark brown while green tea leaves remain green.
Black and green tea may have subtle differences in caffeine and  antioxidant  content but offer similar health benefits.

Shared benefits of green and black tea
While green and black tea differ, they may provide some of the same health benefits.
Both green and black tea are rich in  polyphenols , a group of protective antioxidants. Specifically, they contain  flavonoids , a subgroup of polyphenols.
However, the amount of flavonoids they contain differs.  Research from 2021  found that black tea had a greater total flavonoid content than green tea.
A  2023 research review  of past studies on green tea’s effect on heart health found that its consumption may significantly and positively influence heart health. It may also positively impact diastolic and systolic blood pressure.
Likewise, a  2022 cohort study  using data from 498,043 men and women ages 40 to 69 between 2006 and 2010 in the United Kingdom looked at black tea’s effect.
Researchers found that drinking 2 or more cups of black tea daily was modestly associated with lower all-cause mortality risk, including mortality from:
all heart diseases
ischemic heart disease
stroke
Some  evidence  for green tea, however, suggests that its consumption may not reduce your risk of heart disease.
Green and black tea both contain  caffeine , a  stimulant .
Green tea contains less  caffeine  than black tea — about  29 milligrams (mg)  per cup (8 fl oz), compared with  47 mg  for the same serving of black tea.
Caffeine  may potentially :
increase alertness
decrease reaction time
decrease  fatigue
decrease risk of  depression  and  suicide
Green and black teas also  contain  the  amino acid  L-theanine, which isn’t in coffee.
L-theanine  is thought to  trigger the release  of an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain called  gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)  in human and animal studies. This brings about a relaxed but alert state.
It also promotes the release of the mood-enhancing hormone  dopamine .
Green tea contains  slightly more L-theanine  than black tea, though the amounts can vary considerably in every cup.

Green tea is rich in the powerful antioxidant EGCG
Green tea is an excellent source of the potent  antioxidant  epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which is responsible for many  health benefits .
One cup of brewed green tea contains 200 to 300 mg of EGCG.
Possible  benefits of EGCG  in green tea observed in human, animal, and test tube studies include:
anticancer properties and antitumor effects
improvements in neurological diseases, including  Parkinson’s  and  Alzheimer’s disease
liver protection
anti-inflammatory properties
vasoprotective (protects from diseases of the blood vessels)

Black tea contains beneficial theaflavins
Theaflavins are a group of polyphenols  unique to  black tea . They o ffer many health benefits, all related to their antioxidant ability.
They’re formed during the oxidation process and represent  3 to 6%  of all polyphenols in black tea.
These polyphenols can protect fat cells from damage by  free radicals  and may support your body’s natural antioxidant production.
Theaflavins may also  protect you  from  metabolic syndrome  with effects that are:
antiobesity
lipid-lowering
blood sugar-lowering
uric acid-lowering
beneficial for  gut bacteria

Which one should you drink?
While green and black tea differ in their polyphenol composition and production process, both are powerful sources of health-boosting antioxidants. Both teas may have similar effects on heart and brain health.
Some  research from 2017 indicates  that green teas may have higher antioxidant capacities than black teas.
Though  both contain caffeine , black tea usually has more, making it the better choice for those who aren’t sensitive to caffeine and looking for a caffeine boost that isn’t as strong as a cup of coffee.
Green tea also contains more L-theanine, a calming amino acid, and some caffeine.
One tea isn’t necessarily “healthier” than the other — it comes down to personal preference.

The takeaway
Green and black tea provide similar health benefits, including for your heart and brain.
Both also contain some caffeine, powerful antioxidants, and L-theanine, which has a calming effect.
The evidence doesn’t strongly favor one tea over the other or claim that one is “healthier.” Both are great additions to your diet, depending on your flavor palette.
