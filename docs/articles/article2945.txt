This article will take a closer look at Klean Athlete, including what it is, what products it offers, and who it may be a good fit for.

What is Klean Athlete?

Who is Klean Athlete best for?
Klean Athlete offers a range of products formulated specifically for athletes, including protein powders, pre- and post-workout blends, and other products meant to enhance performance.
Because all supplements are third-party tested and NSF Certified for Sport, Klean Athlete’s products may be worth the investment for competitive athletes seeking a safe and effective option to enhance exercise performance.
However, Klean Athlete products are somewhat expensive and may not be the best fit for budget-conscious consumers.
Because Klean Athlete is focused mostly on sports supplements, people looking to improve certain aspects of health or address specific health-related concerns may want to opt for other brands with a more varied product selection.
Additionally, certain Klean Athlete supplements may not be suitable for people following  vegan ,  vegetarian , or  ketogenic  diets.

This zinc supplement from Klean Athlete provides 10 milligrams (mg) of zinc citrate per serving, or about 91% of the recommended Daily Value (DV).

Zinc  is an important nutrient involved in  immune function , wound healing, and the synthesis of protein and DNA ( 3 ).

Interestingly, a small 2014 study concluded that zinc citrate is as well absorbed as zinc gluconate — a form of zinc often featured in over-the-counter supplements — and has a more appealing flavor ( 4 ).

In addition to being gluten-free and vegan, Klean Zinc also has a subtle natural orange flavor and is chewable, making it a good alternative to capsules and pills.

What’s more, because it’s NSF Certified for Sport, it was selected as the top choice for athletes in our list of the  best zinc supplements .

It includes 5 g of creatine monohydrate per serving, which has been shown to increase lean muscle mass and exercise capacity when combined with short duration, high intensity workouts ( 5 ).

According to Klean Athlete, this lemon tea-flavored pre-workout blend is formulated to help you optimize your results each time you exercise.

It includes vitamin C to support recovery, plus  caffeine , which has been shown to improve performance when taken prior to resistance training ( 6 ,  7 ).

Additionally, thanks to its content of  beetroot extract  — a compound that has been shown to increase endurance, workout efficiency, and athletic performance — it’s also our choice for the  best pre-workout supplement  for endurance ( 8 ).

This supplement is vegan, non-GMO, and gluten-free. However, note that it does contain 7 g of carbs per serving and 2 g of added sugar, which may not be ideal for those on a very low carb or ketogenic diet.

Do Klean Athlete supplements work?
Klean Athlete supplements feature high quality, clinically studied ingredients.
In fact, many of the ingredients in the supplements that they offer have been shown to enhance sports performance.
For instance, studies show that creatine could help increase muscle mass and boost exercise capacity ( 5 ).
Branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) , which are found in Klean BCAA + Peak ATP, have also been shown to improve recovery and muscle function after high intensity resistance training ( 9 ).
Plus, the brand uses highly effective forms of nutrients in other products, such as vitamin D3, which is found in their Klean-D and Klean Multivitamin supplements ( 10 ).

Are Klean Athlete supplements safe?
Klean Athlete products are thoroughly tested through in-house and independent laboratories to ensure that they’re safe and free of harmful contaminants.
For the most part, the ingredients used in Klean Athlete supplements — such as creatine, collagen, and whey protein — are also safe and associated with very few side effects ( 11 ,  12 ,  13 ).
However, keep in mind that certain supplements may not be suitable for everyone.
For example, whey protein shouldn’t be used by those with an  allergy to cow’s milk  ( 14 ).
Additionally, there is limited research on the safety of  melatonin  — a key ingredient in their Klean Melatonin supplement — for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding ( 15 ).
Therefore, it’s best to talk with a doctor before adding any Klean Athlete supplements to your routine, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medications.
