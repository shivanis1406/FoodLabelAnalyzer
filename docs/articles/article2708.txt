Title: How to Lose Weight on a Vegetarian Diet

Vegetarianism has become increasingly popular in recent years.
This diet is associated with a lower risk of chronic diseases and may aid weight loss ( 1 ).
However, you may find it difficult to lose weight on a vegetarian diet — especially if you’re eating too many refined carbs or highly processed foods.
This article explains how to lose weight on a vegetarian diet.

What is a vegetarian diet?
Vegetarian diets exclude meat, fish, and poultry.
Some people may follow this diet for religious or ethical reasons, while others are drawn to its possible health benefits.
The main types of vegetarian diets are:
Lacto-ovo-vegetarian:  allows eggs and dairy but excludes meat, fish, and poultry
Lacto-vegetarian:  allows dairy but excludes eggs, meat, fish, and poultry
Ovo-vegetarian:  allows eggs but excludes dairy, meat, fish, and poultry
Vegan:  excludes all animal products, including honey, dairy, and eggs
Other plant-based eating patterns include the  flexitarian  (which includes some animal foods but is mostly vegetarian) and pescatarian (which includes fish but not meat) diets.
Vegetarian diets typically focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. These foods are rich in fiber, micronutrients, and beneficial plant compounds, and tend to be lower in calories, fat, and protein than animal foods.
Since this diet emphasizes nutrient-rich foods, it’s linked to a reduced risk of heart disease, certain cancers, diabetes, and high blood pressure ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
What’s more, studies show that following a vegetarian diet can be an effective way to lose weight ( 6 ,  7 ).
However, the benefits of  vegetarianism  largely depend on the types of foods you eat and your overall dietary habits.
Overeating or choosing too many highly processed foods will provide fewer benefits than a diet based on unrefined, whole plant foods — and may have several downsides.
A vegetarian diet excludes meat, fish, and poultry and mostly focuses on plant foods. It has been linked to weight loss and a reduced risk of chronic diseases, but these benefits depend on which foods you eat.

Barriers to losing weight on a vegetarian diet
While vegetarianism may seem like an effective way to shed excess weight, several factors may prevent this from happening.
Eating more calories than you need can result in weight gain.
Even if you’re filling up on nutritious foods on a vegetarian diet, you may be helping yourself to  larger portions  than necessary.
This is especially common if you skimp on protein intake.
Protein can increase fullness by decreasing levels of ghrelin, a hormone that regulates hunger, which may in turn lower your overall calorie intake and boost weight loss ( 8 ,  9 ,  10 ).
If you don’t eat  enough protein , you might eat more food to feel full — hindering your weight loss efforts.
While your protein needs can be met easily on a vegetarian diet, you may encounter difficulties at first as you eliminate meat from your diet.
Foods that are high in refined carbs, such as bread, pizza, and pasta, can be easy to overeat on a vegetarian diet.
They’re widely available and may sometimes be the only vegetarian options at restaurants or gatherings.
Foods rich in  refined carbs  tend to lack fiber and do not curb hunger as much as whole-grain, complex carbs. As a result, they can load you down with excess calories ( 11 ).
What’s more, some studies suggest that refined carbs trigger the release of extra  insulin , a hormone that regulates blood sugar. This may also contribute to weight gain ( 12 ,  13 ).
In fact, one study including around 500,000 adults detected a strong association between higher insulin levels after carb intake and greater body mass index (BMI) ( 12 ).
When transitioning to a vegetarian diet, you might substantially increase your intake of high-fat plant foods.
Vegetarian meals often incorporate nuts, seeds, nut butters,  avocados , or coconut. While these foods are incredibly nutritious and filling, they also provide 9 calories per gram — compared with 4 calories per gram of proteins and carbs.
For example, 2 tablespoons (32 grams) of  peanut butter  packs a whopping 191 calories, 148 of which come from fat ( 14 ).
What’s more, many people eat more than the recommended serving size of nut butters and other healthy fats.
If you’re relying on too many processed foods as part of a vegetarian diet, you may have a hard time losing weight.
Countless products are technically vegetarian but still harbor  unnecessary additives  and other unhealthy ingredients. Examples include veggie burgers, meat substitutes, freezer meals, baked goods, packaged desserts, and vegan cheese.
These foods are often packed not only with sodium, highly processed compounds, chemical preservatives, and coloring agents but also calories and added sugars.
As a result, they may contribute to weight gain when eaten in excess.
In fact, a review linked the intake of  ultra-processed foods  to an increased risk of obesity, as well as higher LDL (bad) cholesterol and blood pressure levels ( 15 ).
Some barriers to losing weight on a vegetarian diet include not eating enough protein and relying too heavily on refined carbs, calorie-rich foods, and highly processed items.

Tips to lose weight on a vegetarian diet
Several strategies can help promote weight loss on a vegetarian diet, including:
Filling half of your plate with non-starchy vegetables.  Choosing high-fiber veggies, such as broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, leafy greens, and mushrooms, can help you stay full and decrease calorie intake.
Incorporating protein at every meal and snack.   High-protein vegetarian foods  include beans, nuts, seeds, lentils, eggs, dairy products, and soy foods (such as tempeh, tofu, and edamame).
Opting for complex carbs.  These fullness-boosting foods include whole grains, starchy vegetables, fruits, and legumes.
Watching your portions of high-calorie foods.  Pair nuts, seeds, and  healthy fats  with lower-calorie foods so that you don’t overeat.
Eating mostly whole foods.  Unprocessed foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables, do not have any unnecessary ingredients.
Limiting highly processed foods.  Avoid meat alternatives, frozen meals, and other ultra-processed foods, as they likely host unhealthy additives, extra salt, and added sugar.
A balanced vegetarian diet that emphasizes whole plant foods and limits refined carbs and highly processed products may help you lose weight.
Still, don’t forget about other important contributors to weight loss, such as proper sleep, hydration, and exercise.
Including protein at all meals, eating plenty of whole foods, and eliminating highly processed items are just a few of the techniques you can use to lose weight on a vegetarian diet.

Vegetarian foods that aid weight loss
To bolster weight loss, choose a vegetarian diet that’s rich in whole, minimally processed plant foods.
Depending on your specific regimen, you may also incorporate dairy or eggs.
Vegetarian foods that may aid weight loss include:
Non-starchy vegetables:  broccoli, bell pepper, cauliflower, zucchini, mushrooms, tomatoes, eggplant, carrots, celery, and cucumber
Starchy vegetables:  peas, potatoes, corn, and winter squash
Fruits:  berries, oranges, apples,  bananas , grapes, citrus, kiwi, and mango
Whole grains:  quinoa, brown rice, farro, millet, barley, and bulgur wheat

Lean proteins:  beans, legumes, nuts, seeds, nut butters, eggs, Greek yogurt, milk, and soy products like tofu, tempeh, and edamame
Healthy fats:  avocado, olive oil,  coconut , nuts, seeds, nut butters, and cheese
Water and other healthy beverages:  naturally flavored seltzer, fruit-infused water, and plain coffee or tea
Eating a variety of non-starchy vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds may help you lose weight on a vegetarian diet.

Foods to avoid on a vegetarian diet for weight loss
While most plant foods are naturally healthy, highly processed vegetarian foods tend to be less so.
You should limit or avoid the following foods if you’re following a vegetarian diet for weight loss:
Highly processed vegetarian foods:   veggie burgers , meat replacements, freezer meals, frozen desserts, and imitation dairy products
Refined carbs:  white bread, white pasta, bagels, and crackers
Sugary foods and beverages:  candy, cookies, pastries, table sugar, sodas, fruit juices,  energy drinks , and sweet tea
In addition, try to avoid extra-large portions of any food — especially those high in sugar and calories.
If you’re looking to lose weight on a vegetarian diet, you should steer clear of highly processed products, refined carbs, and sugary beverages.
