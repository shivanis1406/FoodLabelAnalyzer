Title: 12 Ways to Promote Long-Term Fat Loss

Making changes to your diet, such as eating more protein and fewer refined carbs, may help increase fat loss over time and benefit your overall health.
Losing body fat can be a challenging task, often requiring hard work, patience, and dedication.
Although many fad diets and fat-burning supplements promise quick results, modifying your diet, lifestyle, and exercise routine is the most effective way to reach and maintain a healthy weight.
Several simple steps can promote long lasting, sustainable fat loss while improving your overall health.
Here are 12 of the best ways to increase fat loss.

1. Start strength training
Strength training is a type of exercise in which your muscles contract against resistance. It builds muscle mass and increases strength over time, and it usually involves  lifting weights .
Research reveals that strength training has multiple health benefits, especially when it comes to fat loss.
According to a review of 58 studies, resistance training for at least 4 weeks may help decrease body fat by an average of 1.46%. It may also significantly reduce body fat mass and  visceral fat , which is a type of fat that surrounds the organs in your belly ( 1 ).
Another study showed that 5 months of strength training was more effective at reducing body fat in adolescents with obesity than aerobic exercise alone ( 2 ).
Plus, resistance training may help preserve fat-free mass, which may increase the number of calories your body burns at rest ( 3 ).
According to one review, resistance training boosted people’s resting metabolic rate compared with a control group, while aerobic exercise had no effect on metabolism ( 4 ).
Doing bodyweight exercises, lifting weights, and using gym equipment are a few easy ways to get started with strength training.
Strength training may not only help decrease your body fat levels but also increase resting energy expenditure and target belly fat.

2. Follow a high protein diet
Eating more protein-rich foods may help reduce your appetite and increase fat burning.
In fact, multiple studies have associated eating more high quality protein with a lower risk of excess body fat and obesity ( 5 ,  6 ).
Other research indicates that a  high protein diet  may help preserve muscle mass and metabolism during weight loss ( 7 ).
Upping your protein intake may also increase feelings of fullness, decrease hunger, and reduce calorie intake — all factors that aid weight loss ( 8 ,  9 ).
Try adding a few servings of high protein food to your diet each day.  Protein-rich foods  include meat, seafood, eggs, legumes, tofu, and dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt.
Eating more protein may be associated with a lower risk of belly fat. Plus, it may decrease appetite, lower calorie intake, and preserve muscle mass.

3. Get more sleep
Going to bed a bit earlier or setting your alarm clock a little later is a simple strategy to help you reach and maintain a healthy weight.
In fact, several studies associate  sufficient sleep  with weight loss.
One 10-year study linked sleeping fewer than 6 hours per night to a higher risk of obesity among young women ( 10 ).
Another small study showed that getting 1 less hour of sleep per night led to less fat loss in people following a low calorie diet, compared with a control group ( 11 ).
Other research indicates that a lack of sleep may contribute to alterations in hunger hormones, increased appetite, and a higher risk of obesity ( 12 ).
Although everyone needs a different amount of sleep, most studies tie at least 7 hours of sleep per night to the most benefits for weight management and overall health ( 13 ).
To support a  healthy sleep cycle , stick to a regular sleep schedule, limit your intake of caffeine in the evening, and minimize your use of electronic devices before bed.
Getting enough sleep may help reduce your appetite and hunger levels, as well as lower your risk of weight gain.

4. Eat more healthy fats
Although it may seem counterintuitive, increasing your intake of healthy fats may prevent weight gain.
A 12-month study associated following a  Mediterranean diet  rich in healthy fats from olive oil and nuts with greater long-term weight loss, compared with a low fat diet ( 14 ).
Another review linked diets enriched with olive oil to greater reductions in body weight and belly fat compared with diets without olive oil ( 15 ).
What’s more, increased intake of trans fats — a type of fat often found in fried or processed foods — is associated with increased long-term weight gain ( 16 ).
Olive oil, coconut oil, avocados, nuts, and seeds are just a few examples of  nutritious fats  that can benefit your health.
Keep in mind that healthy fat is still high in calories, so it’s important to moderate your intake. Instead of eating more fat overall, try swapping fried foods, processed ingredients, and refined oils for the healthy varieties above.
A higher intake of healthy fats, such as olive oil and nuts, is associated with a lower risk of weight gain.

5. Drink unsweetened beverages
Swapping out sugary drinks for healthier selections is one of the easiest ways to promote long-term, sustainable fat loss.
For example, sugar-sweetened beverages like  soda  are often packed with calories and offer little nutritional value. Alcohol is also high in calories and may lower inhibitions, which may increase your risk of overeating ( 17 ).
Studies have associated drinking both sugar-sweetened beverages and alcohol with a higher risk of excess belly fat ( 18 ,  19 ).
Instead, opt for calorie-free beverages like water or unsweetened  green tea .
According to one small study in 14 young men, drinking 1 pint (570 mL) of water before a meal increased feelings of fullness, reduced hunger, and decreased the number of calories eaten during the meal ( 20 ).
Alternatively, green tea contains caffeine and is rich in antioxidants, both of which may help increase fat burning and metabolism ( 21 ,  22 ).
Sugar-sweetened beverages and alcoholic drinks may be linked to a higher risk of increased belly fat. Replace them with green tea or water, which have been shown to increase weight loss and fat burning.

6. Fill up on fiber
Soluble fiber — which is found in plant foods — absorbs water and moves through your digestive tract slowly, helping you feel full for longer ( 23 ).
According to some studies, increasing your intake of  high fiber foods  may protect against weight gain. These foods include fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds.
For example, one study in 345 people tied eating more fiber to increased weight loss and improved dietary adherence ( 24 ).
Another review found that increasing  soluble fiber  intake significantly decreased body weight and belly fat, independent of calorie intake ( 25 ).
Upping your fiber intake by consuming foods like fresh fruits, veggies, and legumes may boost fat loss, feelings of fullness, and weight loss.

7. Choose whole grains instead of refined carbs
Decreasing your intake of  refined carbs  may help you lose extra body fat.
During processing, refined grains are stripped of their bran and germ, resulting in a final product that’s low in fiber and nutrients.
Refined carbs also tend to have a high glycemic index (GI), which may cause spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels that lead to increased hunger. Still, you’re likelier to see these effects if you eat refined carbs on their own rather than as part of a balanced meal ( 26 ).
What’s more, studies associate diets high in refined carbs with increased belly fat over time ( 27 ,  28 ,  29 ).
Conversely, diets high in whole grains are tied to a lower body mass index (BMI) and body weight, plus a smaller waist circumference ( 30 ).
Just keep in mind that traditional weight metrics like BMI  don’t capture the full portrait of health .
Aim to replace refined carbs from pastries, processed foods, pastas, white breads, and breakfast cereals with whole grains like whole wheat, quinoa, buckwheat, barley, and oats.
Refined carbs are low in fiber and nutrients, so it’s best to choose nutrient-dense whole grains for long-term, sustainable fat loss.

8. Increase your cardio
Cardio, also known as aerobic exercise, is one of the most common forms of exercise. It’s any type of exercise that specifically trains the heart and lungs.
Adding cardio to your routine may be one of the most effective ways to enhance fat burning and weight loss.
For example, one review of 15 studies tied increased aerobic exercise to decreased  belly fat  in middle-age women ( 31 ).
Other studies have found that aerobic exercise may increase muscle mass and decrease belly fat, waist circumference, and body fat ( 32 ,  33 ,  34 ).
Most research recommends 150–300 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise per week, or roughly 20–40 minutes of cardio each day ( 35 ).
Running, walking, cycling, and swimming are just a few  examples of cardio workouts .
Studies show that the more aerobic exercise people get, the more body fat they tend to lose. Cardio may also help reduce waist circumference and increase muscle mass.

9. Drink coffee
The caffeine in  coffee  stimulates your central nervous system, increases metabolism, and boosts the breakdown of fatty acids ( 36 ).
Caffeine has also been shown to enhance fat burning during aerobic exercise, particularly for those who are untrained or sedentary ( 37 ).
One large review of 12 studies associated increased coffee intake with a lower risk of obesity, especially for men. Another study including 2,623 people linked higher caffeine intake to a higher rate of success with weight loss maintenance ( 38 ,  39 ).
To maximize the health benefits of coffee, avoid adding large amounts of cream and sugar. Instead,  enjoy it black  or with a small splash of milk.
Coffee contains caffeine, which may boost metabolism and fat breakdown. Studies suggest that high caffeine intake may aid weight loss.

10. Try high intensity interval training (HIIT)
High intensity interval training (HIIT)  is a form of exercise that pairs quick bursts of activity with short recovery periods to keep your heart rate elevated.
Studies show that HIIT is incredibly effective at ramping up fat burning and promoting sustainable weight loss.
One review found that doing HIIT 3 times weekly for an average of 10 weeks significantly reduced body fat mass and waist circumference ( 40 ).
What’s more, HIIT required 40% less training time commitment than moderate-intensity continuous training, which includes activities like running, rowing, or using an  elliptical  ( 40 ).
According to another study, HIIT helped people burn up to 30% more calories than other types of exercise, such as cycling or jogging, in the same amount of time ( 41 ).
For an easy way to get started, try alternating between walking and jogging or sprinting for 30 seconds at a time. You can also cycle between exercises like burpees, pushups, or squats with short rest periods in between.
HIIT may increase fat burning and help you expend more calories in a shorter period than other forms of exercise.

11. Add probiotics to your diet
Probiotics are a type of beneficial bacteria found in your digestive tract. In fact, these bacteria have been shown to play a role in everything from immunity to mental health ( 42 ).
Increasing your intake of probiotics through either food or supplements may also rev up fat burning and support long-term weight management.
One review of 15 studies showed that people who took probiotics experienced significantly larger reductions in body weight, fat percentage, and BMI compared with those who took a placebo ( 43 ).
Another small study showed that taking probiotic supplements helped people following a high fat, high calorie diet stave off fat and weight gain ( 44 ).
Certain strains of probiotics in the genus  Lactobacillus  may be especially effective at aiding weight and fat loss ( 45 ).
Taking supplements is a simple, convenient way to get in a concentrated dose of probiotics every day. Alternatively, you can eat  probiotic-rich foods  like kefir, tempeh, natto, kombucha, kimchi, and sauerkraut.
Taking probiotic supplements or increasing your intake of probiotic foods may help reduce body weight and fat percentage.

12. Try intermittent fasting
Intermittent fasting is a diet pattern that involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting.
Although it may not be a good fit for everyone, some research indicates that it may  enhance both weight loss and fat loss .
One review on intermittent fasting examined alternate-day fasting, a method in which you alternate between days of fasting and eating normally. Over 3–12 weeks, this method reduced body weight by up to 7% and decreased body fat by up to 12 pounds (5.5 kg) ( 46 ).
Another small study showed that eating only during an 8-hour window each day helped decrease fat mass and maintain muscle mass when combined with resistance training ( 47 ).
Several  types of intermittent fasting  exist, including Eat Stop Eat, the Warrior Diet, the 16/8 method, and the 5:2 diet. Seek out a variation that fits your schedule, and don’t be afraid to experiment to find what works best for you.
Intermittent fasting has been shown to reduce body weight and body fat. It may also help preserve muscle mass when combined with resistance training.

Frequently asked questions
Studies suggest that gradual weight loss may be more beneficial for improving body composition and reducing body fat. Losing weight slowly may also reduce the risk of putting it back on again later ( 48,   49 ).
Both dietary strategies and exercise can help reduce belly fat. Experts are unsure which is the most effective but research indicates you’ll probably need a combination of the two.
One study found that females after menopause lost belly fat when they shed 6–7% of their weight through a small calorie restriction and exercise ( 50 ).
You lose fat when you take in fewer calories, or less energy, than you use. Exercise can help burn fat and either maintain or build muscle ( 51 ).
No foods will specifically enable you to burn belly fat, but you are less likely to continue gaining weight if you focus on fresh fruits and vegetables, healthy fats, and whole grains rather than highly processed foods with a lot of refined carbs and added sugar.
Some people follow a high-protein diet for weight and fat loss, but it’s best to speak with a doctor before making this change.

The bottom line
To lose body fat sustainably, it’s best to avoid  crash diets  and unsafe supplements.
Rather, you should incorporate healthy habits into your routine, such as eating whole grains instead of refined carbs, replacing sugary drinks with water, trying probiotics, or drinking coffee.
Be sure to pair these simple nutrition tips with a well-rounded diet and  active lifestyle  to promote long-lasting, sustainable fat burning.
Try this today:  If you’re struggling to stay motivated, try focusing on short-term, achievable goals that are specific and measurable. Finding a friend or family member with similar exercise or lifestyle goals may also help you hold yourself accountable.
