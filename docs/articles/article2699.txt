Title: Is a Grain-Free Diet Healthy? Everything You Need to Know

Grains are a staple in most traditional diets, but a growing number of people are cutting out this food group.
Some do so because of allergies or intolerances, while others opt for a grain-free diet in an attempt to lose weight or improve their health.
This way of eating is said to offer various health benefits, from improved digestion to reduced inflammation and blood sugar levels. However, it may also have drawbacks, and it may be unsuitable for some.
This article takes a critical look at a grain-free diet, including its benefits and potential drawbacks.

What is a grain-free diet?
A grain-free diet eliminates all grains, as well as foods that come from them.
This includes gluten-containing grains such as:
wheat
spelt
barley
rye
triticale
It also include ones that do not contain gluten (non-glutenous), such as:
dried corn
millet
rice
sorghum
oats
Moreover, unlike fresh corn, which is considered a  starchy vegetable , dried corn is viewed as a grain. Therefore, foods made from corn flour are also avoided.
Plus, some people may choose to exclude ingredients derived from grains, such as  rice syrup  or high fructose corn syrup. However, this is not a strict requirement of such a diet.
A grain-free diet eliminates all grains, including wheat, spelt, barley, rye, dried corn, millet, rice, and oats, as well as foods — and sometimes even ingredients — that are made from them.

How to follow a grain-free diet?
To follow a grain-free diet, you need to avoid eating all grains, as well as grain-derived foods. This includes:
bread
pasta
muesli
oatmeal
rice cakes
breakfast cereals
pastries
cookies
That said, most grain-free diets permit small amounts of pseudocereals, such as quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat. Pseudocereals can be prepared and eaten similarly to grains, but they are not technically considered grains.
A grain-free diet can be naturally  low in carbs , but this isn’t a requirement. Those who wish to include more carbs can get them from fruits, legumes, and starchy vegetables, such as potatoes, squash, and fresh corn.
There are no restrictions regarding non-grain-based foods.
Therefore, you may include as much meat, fish, eggs, nuts, seeds, sugar, fats, or dairy as you wish — though proponents of grain-free diets tend to discourage eating overly processed foods.
Grain-free diets exclude all grains and grain-derived products but allow for small amounts of pseudocereals. They can include as much fruit, vegetables, meat, eggs, dairy, legumes, nuts, seeds, sugar, and fat as you wish.

Benefits of a grain-free diet
A grain-free diet may offer several health benefits.
A grain-free diet is most commonly followed by those with certain autoimmune diseases, and several studies support its use in these cases.
For example,  celiac disease  is an autoimmune disorder that affects around 1% of the Western population. It causes your body to mistake gluten, a protein in wheat, as a threat, sending your immune system into overdrive ( 1 ).
This can lead to gut inflammation, which in turn can cause severe nutrient deficiencies and other digestive concerns. People with celiac disease must exclude all gluten-containing grains from their diet ( 2 ,  3 ).
Similarly, some people are allergic to wheat and must avoid all foods containing it. Others may be intolerant to gluten or other compounds in grains despite not having celiac disease or a wheat allergy. ( 4 ).
People with such a  non-celiac gluten sensitivity  commonly report symptoms like stomach pain,  bloating ,  constipation ,  diarrhea ,  eczema , headaches, or fatigue when eating grains and may benefit from excluding them from their diet ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ).
Finally, in a 6-week study in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), following a grain-free diet improved symptoms in 73% of participants ( 9 ).
Grains may contribute to inflammation, which is believed to be the root cause of many chronic diseases.
Some test-tube, animal, and human studies suggest a link between daily intake of wheat or processed grains and  chronic inflammation  ( 10 ,  11 ,  12 ).
However, not all studies agree ( 13 ).
The lack of consensus may be explained by the type of grain researched. For instance, while refined grains may increase inflammation, whole grains appear to have very little effect on inflammation, and in some cases, may even lower it ( 13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 ).
Plus, cutting out grains may cause some people to naturally increase the quantity or variety of fruits and vegetables they eat — both of which may help reduce inflammation ( 17 ,  18 ,  19 ).
Still, it’s worth noting that  whole grains  may offer anti-inflammatory benefits of their own. Unless you have celiac disease, wheat allergy, or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, you likely don’t need to completely cut out grains to successfully fight inflammation ( 20 ).
A grain-free diet may promote  weight loss , likely because it’s naturally devoid of processed grains found in calorie-rich, nutrient-poor foods like white bread, white pasta, pizza, doughnuts, cookies, and other baked goods.
What’s more, cutting a whole food group out of your diet may reduce your overall daily calorie intake, creating the calorie deficit needed to lose weight.
Yet research clearly shows that as long as you create a calorie deficit, you will lose weight — regardless of whether your diet contains grains. In fact, evidence suggests that eating whole grains may promote weight loss and  boost your metabolism  ( 21 ,  22 ,  23 ,  24 ).
So, cutting out all grains from your diet is not a requirement for weight loss.
Grains are naturally rich in carbs.
That’s why diets rich in grains may cause concerns for people who have a difficult time dealing with large  amounts of dietary carbs , such as those with diabetes or metabolic syndrome.
Refined grains, such as those found in white bread, white pasta, and many other processed foods, are particularly problematic because they’re devoid of fiber.
This leads them to be digested very quickly, generally causing a spike in blood sugar levels shortly after a meal ( 25 ,  26 ).
That said, fiber-rich whole grains may help  stabilize and prevent spikes in blood sugar levels . So, cutting out all grains is not the only way to lower blood sugar levels ( 25 ,  27 ,  28 ).
A grain-free diet may also offer other health benefits:
May improve mental health.  Studies link gluten-containing diets to  anxiety ,  depression , mood disorders,  ADHD ,  autism , and  schizophrenia . However, it’s currently impossible to know whether grains caused these disorders ( 29 ,  30 ).
May help alleviate pain.  Gluten-free diets may help reduce pelvic pain in women with  endometriosis , a disorder that causes the tissue lining the inside of the uterus to grow outside of it ( 8 ,  31 ).
May reduce symptoms of fibromyalgia.  A gluten-free diet may help reduce the widespread pain experienced by people with fibromyalgia ( 32 ).
Despite promising preliminary results, more studies are needed to confirm these effects.
It’s also worth noting that most of these studies looked only at the effect of gluten-containing grains. There’s no evidence to suggest that it’s necessary to exclude all grains from your diet to attain these benefits.
A grain-free diet may reduce inflammation, aid weight loss, and improve digestion and blood sugar levels. It may also promote mental health and alleviate pain in people with fibromyalgia or endometriosis, though more research is needed.

Potential downsides
A grain-free diet may also come with certain downsides.
A diet devoid of grains, particularly fiber-rich whole grains, may limit your intake of fiber.
Unprocessed grains are a particularly good source of insoluble fiber. This type of fiber adds bulk to your stools, helping food move through your gut more easily and reducing your risk of  constipation  ( 33 ).
If you’re following a grain-free diet, try increasing your intake of  fiber-rich foods  like fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and seeds to lower this risk ( 34 ).
Whole grains are a good source of nutrients, particularly fiber, B vitamins, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, and selenium ( 35 ,  36 ,  37 ).
On the other hand, processed grains, whose bran and germ have been removed, lack most of their fiber, vitamins, minerals, and other beneficial plant compounds ( 38 ).
Studies show that unnecessarily following a grain-free diet may increase your risk of  nutrient deficiencies , particularly in B vitamins, iron, and trace minerals ( 39 ).
You may be able to prevent this to a certain degree by increasing your intake of pseudocereals like quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat, as these tend to contain many of the same nutrients as whole grains ( 40 ,  41 ,  42 ).
In addition, increasing your intake of other foods, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, meat, fish, and  eggs , can help make up for any nutrients no longer provided by grains.
Though research supports the benefits of excluding specific grains from certain people’s diets, evidence on the benefits of excluding all grains from everyone’s diet is lacking.
Plus, most of the benefits linked to a grain-free diet can be achieved in ways that don’t require cutting out an entire food group.
Moreover, excluding all grains from your diet can reduce variety and make your diet unnecessarily restrictive. This may make this way of eating less sustainable in the long term.
What’s more, unnecessarily demonizing grains under the disguise of health may serve to promote extreme fixation on healthy eating, which is common in people with orthorexic  disordered eating behaviors  ( 43 ).
Grain-free diets may limit nutrient intake, increase your risk of constipation, and be difficult to sustain in the long term. Unnecessarily demonizing grains for purported health reasons may also promote orthorexic eating behaviors.

Foods to eat
The following food categories can be included on a grain-free diet:
Fruits.  All types of fruit are allowed, whether fresh, dried, or frozen.
Vegetables.  These can be eaten raw, cooked, or incorporated into salads or soups. Starchy vegetables like potatoes, squash, and fresh corn are good, carb-rich alternatives to grains.
Protein-rich animal products.  This category includes meat,  fish , seafood, eggs, and dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt.
Protein-rich plant foods.  Legumes, tofu, tempeh, edamame, natto, soymilk, soy yogurt, and mock meats devoid of grain-based ingredients can be enjoyed on a grain-free diet.
Pseudocereals.  This includes quinoa, buckwheat, and amaranth.
Nuts and seeds.  This includes all types of nuts and seeds, as well as butters and flours made from them.
Non-grain-based flours and foods made from them.  Almond, flaxseed, chickpea, soy, red lentil, and coconut flour, as well as noodles, bread, and other baked goods made from them, are permitted.
Fats.  These include olive oil, butter,  coconut oil , and avocado oil.
You may also choose to include marinades and salad dressings as added fats, as well as sweeteners, such as sugar, maple syrup, or honey. Still, you’re encouraged to focus on whole, minimally processed foods.
A grain-free diet allows most foods, as long as they’re devoid of grains. This includes fruits, vegetables, legumes, meat, fish, seafood, eggs, dairy, pseudocereals, nuts, seeds, and non-grain-based flours.

Foods to avoid
Grain-free diets generally exclude the following food categories:
Most baked goods:  grain-based breads,  bagels , tortillas, tacos, pizza, etc.
Most pastries:  grain-based doughnuts, cookies, croissants, muffins, etc.
Most noodles:  pasta, rice noodles, ramen noodles, udon noodles, etc.
Breakfast cereals:  muesli, oatmeal, cream of wheat, etc.
Grain-based flours:  all-purpose flour, graham flour, corn flour, and rice flour, as well as all foods made from them
Many snack foods:  popcorn, crackers, muesli bars, rice crackers, etc.
Grain-based side dishes:  rice, orzo, millet, couscous, polenta, etc.
Grain-based meat replacement:  seitan, etc.
Grain-based milk alternatives:  oat milk, rice milk, etc.
You may also want to avoid grain-based alcoholic beverages, such as beer, gin, whiskey, sake, and  Scotch , as well as foods containing grain-derived ingredients like rice syrup or high fructose corn syrup.
A grain-free diet excludes all grain-containing foods. It may also limit the intake of alcoholic beverages derived from grains or foods containing grain-derived ingredients.

Sample menu
Here’s a typical 3-day menu suitable for a grain-free diet.
Breakfast:  egg or tofu scramble with plenty of vegetables and homemade hash browns
Lunch:  salad topped with your choice of veggies, cooked  amaranth , smoked tofu, or salmon, and a raspberry vinaigrette dressing
Dinner:  coconut-lime curry with shrimp or marinated tempeh on a bed of cauliflower rice
Breakfast:  smoothie made with milk (or a plant-based, grain-free alternative), frozen mango, flax seeds, spinach, and an optional scoop of  protein powder
Lunch:  hearty pumpkin, carrot, and white-bean soup topped with roasted cashew nuts
Dinner:  oven-baked sweet potato topped with chili, fresh corn, chopped lettuce, guacamole, and salsa
Breakfast:  mini breakfast quiches with spinach
Lunch:  bun-less meat or veggie burger, topped with roasted peppers, hummus, avocado, and a side of buckwheat pasta salad
Dinner:   spiralized zucchini noodles  topped with a meat or tofu Bolognese sauce, roasted pine nuts, and Parmesan or nutritional yeast
A well-balanced grain-free diet can include a variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and legumes, as well as some meat, fish, seafood, eggs, and dairy.

Easy grain-free snacks
Here are a few simple yet nutritious grain-free snack ideas to tide you over between meals:
fresh fruit with yogurt
trail mix
chia pudding
flax crackers with olive tapenade
smoothies
grain-free nut and fruit bars
kale chips
hummus and veggies
seaweed  snacks
almond-flour muffins
apple chips
nut butter fruit dip
homemade frozen yogurt popsicles
coconut, date, and nut balls
There are many ways to include snacks on a grain-free diet. The combinations above can be eaten between meals.

The bottom line
Though limiting certain grains may benefit some health conditions, cutting out all grains is unnecessary for most people and can even be detrimental to your health.
Plus, the purported benefits of a grain-free diet can often be achieved in ways that don’t require cutting out an entire food group from your diet.
So, it’s worth considering whether this diet offers you more pros than cons before giving it a try.
