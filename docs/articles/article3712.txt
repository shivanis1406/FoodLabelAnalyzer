Title: 6 Evidence-Based Health Benefits of Hemp Seeds

Hemp seeds are a nutritious plant-based protein source that may provide health benefits, including supporting digestion and heart health.
Hemp seeds are the seeds of the hemp plant, Cannabis sativa.
They’re from the same species as cannabis but a different variety. They contain only trace amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive compound in cannabis.
Hemp seeds are exceptionally nutritious and rich in healthy fats, protein, and various minerals.
This article reviews six proven health benefits of hemp seeds.

1. Hemp seeds are incredibly nutritious
Technically a nut, hemp seeds are very nutritious. They have a mild, nutty flavor and are often referred to as hemp hearts.
Hemp seeds contain over  30% fat . They’re exceptionally rich in two essential fatty acids, linoleic acid (omega-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (omega-3).
They also contain  gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) , which has been linked to several health benefits.
Hemp seeds are a great protein source, as more than  25%  of their total calories are from high quality protein.
That is considerably more than similar foods like  chia seeds  and  flaxseeds , whose calories are 16% to 18% protein.
Hemp seeds are also a great source of  vitamin E and minerals , such as phosphorus, potassium, sodium, magnesium, sulfur, calcium, iron, and zinc.
Hemp seeds can be consumed raw, cooked, or roasted. Hempseed oil is also very healthy and has been used as a food and medicine in China for at least 3,000 years.
Hemp seeds are rich in healthy fats and essential fatty acids. They’re also a great protein source and contain high amounts of vitamin E, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, magnesium, sulfur, calcium, iron, and zinc.

2. Hemp seeds may reduce your risk of heart disease
Heart disease is the  No. 1 cause of death worldwide . Eating hemp seeds may reduce your risk of heart disease. The seeds contain high amounts of the  amino acid arginine , which produces nitric oxide in your body.
Nitric oxide is a gas molecule that dilates and relaxes blood vessels, lowering blood pressure and  reducing the  risk of heart disease .
In a  2023 study  including over 13,000 people, increased arginine intake corresponded with decreased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammation marker. High levels of CRP are linked to a greater risk of heart disease.
The GLA found in hemp seeds has also been  linked to reduced inflammation , which may decrease your risk of conditions like heart disease.
Additionally, early  animal studies  have shown that hemp seeds or hempseed oil may reduce blood pressure, decrease the risk of blood clot formation, and help the heart recover after a heart attack.
Hemp seeds are a great source of arginine and GLA, which have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease.

3. Hemp seeds and hempseed oil may benefit skin disorders
Fatty acids  may affect immune responses  in your body.
Studies suggest that your immune system depends on the balance of  omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids .
Hemp seeds are a good source of polyunsaturated and essential fatty acids. They have about a 3-to-1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3, which is considered in the optimal range.
A  2005 study  showed that giving hempseed oil to people with eczema, including atopic dermatitis, may improve blood levels of essential fatty acids.
The oil may also relieve  dry skin , improve itchiness, and reduce the need for skin medication.
Hemp seeds are rich in healthy fats. They have a 3-to-1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3, which may benefit skin diseases and provide relief from eczema and its uncomfortable symptoms.

4. Hemp seeds are a great source of plant-based protein
About  25%  of calories in hemp seeds come from protein, which is relatively high.
In fact, by weight, hemp seeds provide  similar amounts of protein as beef and lamb : 30 grams (g) of hemp seeds, or 2 to 3 tablespoons, provide about 11 g of protein.
They’re considered a complete protein source, which means that they provide all the essential amino acids. Your body cannot produce essential amino acids and must obtain them from your diet.
Complete protein sources are very rare in the plant kingdom, as plants often lack the amino acid lysine.  Quinoa  is another example of a complete, plant-based protein source.
Hemp seeds contain significant amounts of the amino acids methionine and cysteine, as well as very high levels of arginine and glutamic acid.
Hemp protein is also  very digestible  — better than protein from many grains, nuts, and legumes.
About 25% of the calories in hemp seeds come from protein. What’s more, they contain all the essential amino acids, making them a complete protein source.

5. Hemp seeds may reduce symptoms of PMS and menopause
Approximately  80% to 90%  of women of reproductive age may experience physical or emotional symptoms caused by premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
These symptoms are very likely caused by sensitivity to the  hormone prolactin .
GLA, found in hemp seeds, produces prostaglandin E1, which reduces the effects of prolactin.
A  2011 study  of women with PMS, taking 1 g of essential fatty acids — including 210 milligrams of GLA — per day resulted in a significant decrease in symptoms.
Other studies  have shown that primrose oil, which is rich in GLA as well, may be highly effective in reducing symptoms for women who didn’t have success with other PMS therapies. It decreased breast pain and tenderness, depression, irritability, and fluid retention associated with PMS.
Because hemp seeds are high in GLA, several  studies  indicate that they may help reduce symptoms of menopause, too.
The exact process is unknown, but the GLA in hemp seeds may regulate the  hormone imbalances  and inflammation associated with menopause.
Hemp seeds may reduce symptoms associated with PMS and menopause due to their high levels of GLA.

6. Whole hemp seeds may aid digestion
Fiber  is an essential part of your diet and is linked to  better digestive health .
Whole hemp seeds are a good source of both soluble and insoluble fiber, containing  20% and 80% , respectively.
Soluble fiber  forms a gel-like substance in your gut. It’s a valuable source of nutrients for beneficial digestive bacteria and  may also reduce spikes in blood sugar and regulate cholesterol levels .
Insoluble fiber adds bulk to your stool and may help food and waste pass through your gut. It has also been linked to a  reduced risk of diabetes .
A  2023 study  looked at the blood biochemical changes induced by hemp seeds in rats with diabetes. Researchers found significant decreases in glucose and cholesterol concentrations after hemp seed consumption.
However, de-hulled or shelled hemp seeds — also known as hemp hearts — contain very little fiber because the fiber-rich shell has been removed.
This  2022 study  also notes that the protein in hemp seeds, called hemp protein isolates, has a high degree of digestibility.
Whole hemp seeds contain high amounts of fiber — both soluble and insoluble — which benefits digestive health.

Takeaway
Though hemp seeds have only recently become popular in the West, they’re a staple food in many societies and provide excellent nutritional value.
They are very rich in healthy fats, high quality protein, and several minerals.
However, hemp seed shells may contain trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%), the active compound in cannabis. People who have been dependent on cannabis may want to avoid hemp seeds in any form.
Overall, hemp seeds are incredibly healthy. They may be one of the few superfoods worthy of their reputation.
