Downsides of banana chips
Banana chips have several drawbacks to consider.
Banana chips are usually  fried in oil  to give them a crunchy texture. Manufacturers tend to use coconut or sunflower oil but may utilize any frying oil.
A single cup (72 grams) of banana chips packs 24 grams of fat, 21 of which are saturated. A diet high in  saturated fats  from processed foods is linked to a higher risk of chronic illnesses like heart disease ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
Additionally, the high fat content of banana chips adds a lot of extra calories. For example, the same serving of banana chips contains over 250% more calories than a medium banana ( 1 ,  5 ).
Some banana chips are coated in syrup or honey, significantly adding to their  sugar content .
One cup (72 grams) of banana chips contains 25 grams of sugar, which includes 10.5 grams of added sugar, compared with 14.5 grams of natural sugar in a medium (118-gram) banana ( 1 ,  5 ).
Most banana chips are fried in oil and sweetened — factors that not only contribute to their high calorie and sugar content but also may increase disease risk.

Are they better than other chips?
A  whole banana  is a much better option than banana chips. Still, if you’re craving something crunchy, you may wonder whether banana chips are healthier than other chips.
This table compares the nutrients in a whole banana versus banana chips, potato chips, and  veggie  chips ( 1 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ):
Banana chips are much higher in calories, total fat, saturated fat, and sugar than either  potato  or vegetable chips.
While these chips are lighter and less filling than banana chips, meaning that you’re likely to eat more in one sitting, you would need to eat a very large serving to equal banana chips’ saturated fat and sugar content.
It’s best to limit your intake no matter the chips you buy.
For a healthier option, choose dried or baked — not fried — banana chips that are flavored with herbs and spices rather than sugar.
Fried banana chips are much higher in calories, fat, and sugar than potato or veggie chips. Baked or dried banana chips with no added sugar are a better option, but you should stick to a small serving regardless.

The bottom line
While they may seem healthy at first glance, banana chips can be  loaded with calories , saturated fat, and added sugar.
For a healthier alternative, look for  dehydrated , non-fried banana chips made without added sugar. Better yet, choose a whole banana.
If you decide to eat banana chips, be mindful of your portion size.
