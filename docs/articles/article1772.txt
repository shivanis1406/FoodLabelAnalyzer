Title: Is It Beneficial to Mix Baking Soda and Apple Cider Vinegar?

While baking soda and apple cider vinegar can benefit health, combining them likely doesn’t provide any additional benefit. They may also cause side effects, especially if you take too much.
Apple cider vinegar and baking soda offer health benefits when taken on their own. Yet, the latest trend involves mixing the two in hopes of achieving even more stellar health.
Once reserved for grade-school science experiments, this combination is touted to improve digestion, reduce joint pain, fight urinary tract infections, and even help you lose weight.
This article explores whether taking baking soda and apple cider vinegar together carries any risks or offers benefits beyond those associated with taking each separately.

What are the benefits of apple cider vinegar?
Test-tube studies suggest that  apple cider vinegar  can  help kill  harmful microorganisms, such as E. coli, S. aureus, and C. albicans.
Apple cider vinegar  may also help lower  blood sugar levels and cholesterol and improve insulin sensitivity. Research also suggests that it may  reduce feelings of hunger  and help people  lose body fat .
That said, to confirm these potential effects, all of these findings need to be replicated in more human studies.

What are the benefits of baking soda?
When it comes to  baking soda , research suggests that using it as part of a mouth rinse  may help prevent  the loss of tooth enamel. In addition, baking soda may  help improve  exercise performance during short-duration, high intensity exercise.
Baking soda supplements may also help  slow the progression  of chronic kidney disease and the  growth of cancerous cells.  Here too, more research is also needed before strong conclusions can be drawn.

Does combining offer additional health benefits?
No research examines the benefits of ingesting a mixture of apple cider vinegar and baking soda, and there is no evidence of health benefits beyond those potentially associated with taking each separately.
The idea of combining baking soda with apple cider vinegar may have come from the idea that it helps  alkalize your body , preventing diseases that thrive in acidic environments.
Yet, this belief ignores the fact that your body has  tightly regulated processes  to control its pH levels and that what you eat or drink has very  little effect  on how acidic or alkaline your body is.

What are the risks of apple cider vinegar and baking soda?
Ingesting baking soda and apple cider vinegar, either together or separately, may have a few potential risks.
Ingesting large amounts of baking soda  may cause  a life threatening condition known as  metabolic alkalosis .
This occurs when the body  can no longer control  the blood pH. It can result from excessively high intakes of alkali compounds like baking soda. It can result in spasms, muscle weakness, an altered mental status, and, if left untreated, an irregular heartbeat and even death.
Due to its high sodium content, high intakes of baking soda may also result in fluid accumulation and high blood pressure, especially in people with  compromised kidney function .
Baking soda should not be given to children under five years old, as it may cause seizures and breathing difficulties. Pregnant people  should also avoid  its intake.
Due to its high acidity, apple cider vinegar  may cause  throat burns or  erode  tooth enamel. In addition, consuming a lot of it could potentially  lead  to low potassium.
There are also potential interactions with medications, such as those used for diabetes or diuretics, so speak to your doctor before adding it – alone or mixed with baking soda – to your diet.

What happens when you mix vinegar and baking soda?
Combining apple cider vinegar with an alkaline compound like baking soda may help neutralize some of its acidity. However, it’s unclear whether the common recipes shared on the internet completely neutralize apple cider vinegar’s acidity.
Combining the two also creates a  chemical reaction that produces gas . Therefore, this mixture may cause gas and  bloating  if you ingest it before all the gas has escaped. However, no studies have researched this effect.
Little is known about the safety of long-term intakes of either of these compounds, let alone their combination. Therefore, until more is known, it’s likely safest to avoid taking this mixture altogether.

Frequently asked questions
Baking soda  and  apple cider vinegar  have some antibacterial qualities that can be beneficial for certain skin conditions, like acne or eczema. However, using them together can also lead to some side effects, and there’s no evidence of greater benefit.
Old  research  suggests that baking soda might be helpful with erectile dysfunction, but this needs to be verified in newer research. There’s no research that  apple cider vinegar  is helpful in this space.

Bottom line
Baking soda and apple cider vinegar may each offer various health benefits when taken on their own. However, no scientific evidence suggests that mixing the two offers additional benefits.
Ingesting either compound bears potential health risks, and little is known about the long-term safety of taking baking soda or apple cider vinegar alone, let alone mixed together.
Therefore, until more is known, it’s likely safest to avoid consuming this mixture.
