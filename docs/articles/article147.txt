Title: 10 Health Benefits of Spirulina

Spirulina is a type of algae that grows in fresh or salt water. It comes as a supplement, in tablet or powder form. People use it for its health benefits, as it is rich in nutrients and has antioxidant properties.
Spirulina is among the world’s most popular supplements. It is made from an organism that grows in both fresh and saltwater.
It is a  type of cyanobacteria , which is a family of single-celled microbes that are often referred to as blue-green  algae . Just like plants, cyanobacteria can produce energy from sunlight via a process called photosynthesis.
Spirulina was  consumed  by the ancient Aztecs but became popular again when NASA proposed that it could be grown in space for use by astronauts.
These days, people use spirulina to boost the levels of nutrients and antioxidants in their bodies, and it may help protect against various diseases.
Here are 10 evidence-based health uses and benefits of spirulina.

1. Rich in many nutrients
Spirulina is packed with nutrients. A single tablespoon (tbsp), or 7 grams (g), of  dried spirulina  powder,  contains:
Protein:  4 g
Thiamin:  14% of the Daily Value (DV)
Riboflavin:  20% of the DV
Niacin:  6% of the DV
Copper:  47% of the DV
Iron:  11% of the DV
It also contains small amounts of  magnesium ,  potassium , and manganese.
In addition, the same amount contains only 20 calories and less than 2 g of carbohydrates.
Spirulina also provides a small amount of fat — around 1 g per tbsp (7 g) — including both  omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids  in an approximately 1.5 to 1 ratio.
Plus, the quality of the protein in spirulina is considered excellent and  provides  all of the  essential amino acids  that your body needs.
Note that it is often claimed that spirulina contains  vitamin B12,  but this is false. It has pseudovitamin B12, which has  not been shown to be effective  in humans.
Spirulina is a type of blue-green algae that grows in both salt and fresh water. It is highly nutritious and a great source of protein, copper, and B vitamins.

2. Boasts powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties
The main component of spirulina is called phycocyanin, which is an  antioxidant  that also gives it its unique blue color.
Phycocyanin can help fight  oxidative stress  by  blocking  the production of molecules that promote inflammation and  providing  impressive antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.
Phycocyanin is the main active compound in spirulina. It has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

3. May lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels
Spirulina  can help lower  total cholesterol, low-density  lipoprotein  (LDL) or bad cholesterol, and  triglycerides , while also increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or good cholesterol, which are all risk factors for heart disease.
According to  one review , spirulina was able to significantly improve these markers in people with  metabolic syndrome  and related disorders.
Studies indicate that spirulina can lower triglycerides and improve cholesterol levels, which may support heart health.

4. Protects LDL cholesterol from oxidation
Fatty structures in your body are susceptible to  oxidative damage . This is known as  lipid peroxidation , a key driver of many serious diseases.
Research  found that the  antioxidants  in spirulina may be particularly effective at reducing lipid peroxidation.
In fact, one  small study  showed that spirulina supplementation was able to reduce exercise-induced lipid peroxidation, inflammation, and muscle damage in 17 rugby players.
Fatty structures in your body can become oxidized, driving the progression of many diseases. Some research suggests that the antioxidants in spirulina may help prevent this.

5. May have anti-cancer properties
While more studies are needed, some evidence suggests that spirulina has  anti-cancer properties .
Research in animals  indicates  that it may help reduce cancer occurrence and tumor size in various cancers.
Spirulina may have anti-cancer properties. However, more research is needed.

6. May reduce blood pressure
One  review of five studies  found that taking 1-8 g of spirulina per day could significantly reduce both  systolic and diastolic blood pressure , especially for people with high  blood pressure levels .
This reduction is thought to be  driven by  an increased production of  nitric oxide , a signaling molecule that helps your blood vessels relax and dilate.
Spirulina may increase production of nitric oxide and reduce blood pressure levels, a major risk factor for many chronic conditions.

7. Improves symptoms of allergic rhinitis
Spirulina is a popular alternative treatment for symptoms of  allergic rhinitis , and there is evidence that it can be effective.
For instance,  one study  found that spirulina was more effective than  cetirizine , an  antihistamine  used to treat allergies, in improving symptoms of allergic rhinitis and decreasing inflammation.
However, more research is needed.
Spirulina supplements may be effective against allergic rhinitis, but more research is needed.

8. Could be effective against anemia
Anemia  is fairly  common  in older adults, leading to prolonged feelings of weakness and  fatigue .
A  2020 study  found that taking spirulina may improve anemia in pregnant people during the second trimester. In 2021,  researchers  also found it may also improve  iron deficiency  in young children.
However, more high-quality, recent studies are still needed.
Research suggests that spirulina may improve anemia in pregnant people, as well as iron deficiency in children.

9. May improve muscle strength and endurance
Exercise-induced oxidative damage is a  major contributor  to  muscle fatigue .
Spirulina may help reduce this, as  research  points to improved muscle strength and endurance.
In  another study , spirulina supplementation was able to improve oxygen uptake during an arm  cycling  exercise, with researchers noting that it could act as an  ergogenic aid  to  enhance athletic performance .
Spirulina may provide multiple exercise benefits, including enhanced endurance and increased muscle strength.

10. Could support blood sugar control
Animal research  suggests that spirulina could help  lower blood sugar  levels.
However, according to  one review of eight studies  on humans, spirulina supplementation in doses ranging from 0.8-8 g daily could significantly reduce  fasting blood sugar levels  in people with  type 2 diabetes .
However, there was no significant effect on blood sugar levels after eating or levels of  hemoglobin A1c , which is  used  to measure long-term  blood sugar control .
Therefore, more research is needed.
Some evidence suggests that spirulina may benefit people with type 2 diabetes by significantly reducing fasting blood sugar levels. Still, more studies are needed.

Frequently asked questions
Spirulina contains protein, vitamins, and minerals and has antioxidant properties. It may help manage inflammation, blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure, among other benefits.
Spirulina is generally considered safe. The Dietary Supplements Information Expert Committee (DSI-EC) has said that it does not pose a major risk to health. However, it  may cause  some side effects such as  difficulty sleeping  and problems with digestion.
People taking certain blood-pressure-lowering,  immunosuppressant , or cholesterol-lowering medications, may need to avoid spirulina due to the potential for interaction with certain chemicals in spirulina.
Always check with a doctor that spirulina is safe for you to use, follow any instructions with care, and obtain your supplements from a reputable source. Some products may be contaminated with heavy metals and other toxins or bacteria.
Learn more about the  side effects and risks of spirulina .
Most people who use spirulina take  up to 10 grams every day for up to 6 months.  A doctor can advise on how often to use it, how much to take, and for how long.
