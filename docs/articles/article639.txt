Title: 11 Impressive Health Benefits of Saffron

Saffron may have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer benefits. However, people who are pregnant should avoid high doses.
Saffron is the most expensive spice in the world, with 1 pound (450 grams) costing between $500 and $5,000.
The reason for its high price is its labor-intensive harvesting method, which makes its production costly.
Saffron is harvested by hand from the Crocus sativus flower, commonly known as the saffron crocus. The term “saffron” applies to the flower’s thread-like structures called stigma.
While saffron’s origin is still debated, it’s been used for nearly  4,000 years  for its medicinal properties.
Here are 11 impressive health benefits of saffron.

1. A powerful antioxidant
Saffron contains an impressive variety of plant compounds. These may act as  antioxidants , molecules that protect your cells against free radicals and  oxidative stress .
Some powerful saffron antioxidants  include :
crocin
crocetin
safranal
picrocrocin
kaempferol
Crocin is perhaps the most notable antioxidant in saffron. It’s responsible for saffron’s red color, and  research  suggests it may have antidepressant properties and could protect brain cells against progressive damage.
Research shows that safranal may have benefits for several health conditions,  such as :
inflammation
asthma
hypertension
cancer
depression
Lastly, kaempferol is found in saffron flower petals. This compound may help boost your immune system and protect your body against several viruses,  including :
hepatitis B
flu
HIV
respiratory syncytial virus

2. May improve mood and treat depressive symptoms
Saffron is nicknamed the sunshine spice. This is not just due to its distinct color but also because it may help brighten your mood.
A  2019 review  found that saffron was significantly more effective than placebos at treating symptoms of mild to moderate depression.
Similarly, other  studies  found that saffron was just as effective as  fluoxetine ,  imipramine , and  citalopram  — conventional treatments for depression. Additionally, fewer people experienced side effects from saffron than from other treatments.
While these findings are promising, longer human studies with more participants are needed before experts can recommend saffron as a treatment for depression.

3. May have cancer-fighting properties
Saffron is high in antioxidants, which help neutralize harmful free radicals. Free radical damage has been linked to chronic diseases,  such as  cancer.
A  2020 review  found that saffron and its compounds have been shown to selectively kill cancer cells or suppress tumor growth while leaving healthy cells unharmed.
Research suggests this effect applies to several types of cancer,  including :
colorectal cancer
breast cancer
lung cancer
prostate cancer
cervical cancer
leukemia
brain cancer
Crocin, the main antioxidant in saffron, may also make cancer cells  more sensitive  to chemotherapy drugs.
While these findings are promising, more research is needed to fully understand the anticancer effects of saffron.

4. May reduce PMS symptoms
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)  is a term that describes physical, emotional, and psychological symptoms occurring before the start of a menstrual period.
A  2024 review  found that saffron may positively affect multiple parts of the female reproductive system, which could provide relief from PMS symptoms.
It’s important to speak with a healthcare professional before taking saffron for PMS symptoms. They may recommend  home remedies  that may be better suited for you.

5. May act as an aphrodisiac
Aphrodisiacs  are foods or supplements that help boost your libido.
Studies have shown that saffron may have aphrodisiac properties, especially in people taking antidepressants.
For instance, the authors of a  2019 review  found that in some studies, taking saffron helped improve:
erectile dysfunction
sexual arousal
sexual satisfaction
genital lubrication
Additionally, a  2018 review  of six studies showed that taking saffron significantly improved erectile function, libido, and overall satisfaction but not semen characteristics.
In a  2012 study  in females with low sexual desire due to taking antidepressants, taking 30 milligrams (mg) of saffron daily over 4 weeks reduced sex-related pain and increased sexual desire and lubrication, compared with a placebo.

6. May reduce appetite and aid weight loss
Research suggests that saffron may help reduce appetite and help with weight management, especially if you have  obesity .
For example, a  2023 study  found that taking 60 mg of saffron per day for 12 weeks was significantly more beneficial than a placebo in reducing body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and weight. Researchers also found that saffron helped improve  HDL (good) cholesterol  and lower  triglyceride levels .
Similarly, a  2017 study  found that taking a saffron extract supplement for 8 weeks helped reduce appetite, body mass index, waist circumference, and total fat mass.

7 to 10. Other potential health benefits
Saffron has been linked to other health benefits that have not yet been extensively studied:
May reduce heart disease risk factors:  Research  indicates  that saffron may help lower LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and blood pressure levels. This could help prevent blood vessels and arteries from clogging.
May lower blood sugar levels:  A  2017 animal study  found that saffron may  lower blood sugar  levels and raise insulin sensitivity.
May improve eyesight in adults with age-related macular degeneration (AMD):  Saffron appears to  help improve  eyesight in adults with AMD and protect against free radical damage, which is linked to AMD.
May improve memory in adults with Alzheimer’s disease:  Saffron’s antioxidant properties may  help improve  cognition in adults with  Alzheimer’s disease .

11. Easy to add to your diet
In small doses, saffron has a subtle taste and aroma and pairs well with savory dishes, such as paella, risotto, and other  rice  dishes.
The best way to draw out saffron’s unique flavor is to soak the threads in hot — but not boiling — water. Add the threads and the liquid to your recipe to achieve a deeper, richer flavor.
Saffron is readily available at most specialty markets and can be purchased as threads or in powdered form. It’s best to buy the threads, if possible, since they can be used in many different ways and are less likely to be adulterated.
Though saffron is the most expensive spice in the world, a small amount goes a long way. You often won’t need more than a pinch in your recipes. In fact, using too much saffron can give your recipes an overpowering medicinal taste.
In addition, saffron is available in supplement form.

Risks, precautions, and dosage
Saffron is generally safe with little to no side effects.
In standard cooking amounts, saffron does not appear to cause adverse effects in humans.
As a dietary supplement, people can safely take up to  1.5 grams (g)  of saffron per day. However, high doses of 5 g or more may have toxic effects.
Pregnant people  should also avoid high doses, which have  been shown  to cause miscarriage in animal studies and  potentially affect  the cervix in humans before pregnancy.
Another issue with saffron, especially saffron powder, is that it may be mixed with other ingredients, such as beet, red-dyed silk fibers, turmeric, and paprika.
It’s important to purchase saffron from a reputable brand to ensure you get an authentic product. If the saffron appears too cheap, it’s best to avoid it.
As with any supplement, speak with a healthcare professional before taking saffron in supplement form.

Frequently asked questions
It’s generally safe to take up to 1.5 g of saffron daily.
Research  suggests saffron may help reduce the risk of conditions that affect the brain, such as depression, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, and epilepsy, among others.

Takeaway
Saffron is a powerful spice high in antioxidants.
It has been linked to health benefits, such as improved mood, libido, and sexual function, as well as reduced PMS symptoms and enhanced weight loss.
Best of all, it’s generally safe for most people and easy to add to your diet.
