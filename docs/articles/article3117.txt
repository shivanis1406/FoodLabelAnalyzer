Title: 7 Health and Nutrition Benefits of Pinto Beans

Pinto beans are an excellent source of protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals. They may offer benefits for your blood sugars and heart, and can may also help lower your chronic disease risk if they don’t have sugar or salt add-ons.
Pinto beans are the most popular dried beans in the United States.
They’re a variety of the common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris ), which is frequently used in Mexican cuisine.
Pinto beans are beige with reddish-brown specks when dried but become a solid light brown or pale pink when cooked. They have an earthy, almost nutty flavor and are simple to prepare. They’re regularly eaten whole or mashed.
Pinto beans are not only full of vitamins and minerals but may also offer several impressive health benefits.
Here are 7 health and nutrition benefits of pinto beans.

1. Loaded with nutrients
Pinto beans are primarily comprised of carbs, fiber, and protein. They also pack an incredible punch of vitamins and minerals.
One cup (171 grams) of pinto beans boiled with salt provides ( 1 ):
Calories:  245
Carbs:  45 grams
Fiber:  15 grams
Protein:  15 grams
Fat:  1 gram
Sodium:  407 mg
Thiamine:  28% of the Daily Value (DV)
Iron:  20% of the DV
Magnesium:  21% of the DV
Phosphorus:  20% of the DV
Potassium:  16% of the DV
As you can see, they boast a good amount of  thiamine  (vitamin B1), which is an essential vitamin that helps your body convert food into energy.
They also offer numerous other minerals, such as iron and  magnesium , and contain small amounts of other B vitamins, zinc, and calcium.
When cooked without salt or other additives, pinto beans are free of cholesterol and low in fat and sodium.
Pinto beans contain important vitamins, minerals, protein, and fiber. In particular, they boast plenty of thiamine, iron, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus.

2. Excellent source of fiber
Fiber is an indigestible carb found in plant foods.
It’s very important for your  digestive health , as it helps feed the good bacteria in your gut. Yet, most people don’t reach their daily recommended fiber intake ( 2 ,  3 ).
Women should aim for 25 grams of fiber per day, while men should get 38 grams ( 4 ).
One cup (171 grams) of boiled pinto beans provides 40–60% of the DV for women and men, respectively.
Adequate intake of  fiber-rich foods , including pinto beans, may promote heart health, blood sugar control, proper digestion, gut health, and even weight loss ( 2 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
Pinto beans are an excellent source of dietary fiber, which is linked to improved blood sugar regulation and gut health, among numerous other benefits.

3. Rich in antioxidants
Pinto beans contain many healthy antioxidants, including polyphenols and flavonoids.
Antioxidants  protect your cells against damage from free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can contribute to disease over time ( 8 ).
Pinto beans are particularly rich in kaempferol, a flavonoid associated with impressive health benefits. Many animal and test-tube studies link it to  repressed cancer growth  ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ,  12 ).
Additionally, kaempferol is associated with reduced inflammation and a lower incidence of stroke ( 13 ,  14 ).
Pinto beans are a rich source of antioxidants — particularly kaempferol, which may provide anticancer benefits.

4. May improve blood sugar regulation
Pinto beans may support  blood sugar control .
Despite their high carb content, they don’t excessively raise blood sugar. Their low glycemic index (GI) means that they’re digested slowly, moderating their blood sugar effects ( 15 ).
Multiple studies show that diets rich in  low-GI foods  may help improve blood sugar regulation ( 16 ,  17 ).
Additionally, pinto beans are high in fiber and protein, both of which slow the release of sugar into your bloodstream ( 3 ,  18 ).
Pinto beans have a low GI and are high in fiber and protein, all of which promote blood sugar management.

5. May aid heart health
Pinto beans are also  heart-healthy .
One small, 8-week study found that eating 1/2 cup (86 grams) of pinto beans every day significantly decreased both total and LDL (bad) cholesterol — high levels of which are associated with increased heart disease risk ( 19 ,  20 ).
In another study, eating pinto beans regularly not only lowered LDL (bad) cholesterol but also encouraged propionate production ( 6 ).
Propionate is a  short-chain fatty acid  (SCFA) shown to help lower blood cholesterol and blood pressure levels ( 21 ,  22 ).
Lastly, pinto beans are rich in various nutrients, such as magnesium and potassium. These minerals help prevent high blood pressure, a crucial risk factor for heart disease ( 1 ,  23 ,  24 ).
Pinto beans may help lower blood pressure, as well as total and LDL (bad) cholesterol, thereby decreasing your risk of heart disease.

6. May boost weight loss
Pinto beans may promote  weight loss .
They’re rich in both protein and fiber, two nutrients that can help you feel full for longer and keep your appetite at bay ( 25 ,  26 ).
Multiple studies have linked bean intake to  increased fullness , lower body weight, and smaller waist circumference ( 27 ,  28 ,  29 ).
Due to their high protein and fiber contents, pinto beans may promote fullness. In turn, increased fullness may lead to weight loss.

7. Easy to add to your diet
Pinto beans are inexpensive and easy to prepare.
One of the easiest ways to prepare them is on the stovetop. If you’re using dried beans, you should wash them and remove any bad beans — those that are broken, spilt, or unnaturally dark.
Soaking the beans overnight will make them cook faster.
To cook, cover them with water or chicken broth in a large pot. You can also add other spices and flavorings, such as onion, garlic, cilantro, or  jalapeño . Bring them to a boil on medium-high heat for 1 minute, then simmer for 2–4 hours on low-medium heat until tender.
Pinto beans can be enjoyed as a healthy side or part of a high-protein, meatless meal.
If you prefer buying canned beans, just keep in mind that many  canned products  can contain added salt, sugar, and preservatives.
Pinto beans are an easy and inexpensive dish to prepare. If you purchase canned beans, watch out for excess sugar, salt, and preservatives.

The bottom line
Pinto beans are extremely nutritious.
They’re an excellent source of  protein , fiber, vitamins, and minerals. These nutrients may provide several benefits, including improved blood sugar control and heart health.
Pinto beans are also rich in various antioxidants and may help lower your risk of chronic disease.
What’s more, they’re  affordable , easy to prepare, and pair well with numerous dishes. Just remember that canned varieties may harbor unwanted ingredients, like sugar and salt.
