The app also allows you to choose from two health journeys depending on your goals:
Total Wellness, which is focused on improving overall health
Weight Health, which is focused on weight loss
You can switch journeys at any time by contacting customer support.
The app also provides a  daily calorie goal  and a general estimate for the number of grams of carbohydrates, protein, and fat you may want to aim for each day to meet your weight goals.
As with many other  weight loss apps , Wellos features diet, activity, and weight logs to monitor your progress and help you stay on track.
Once your profile is created, you can browse through health lessons, view recipe collections, and connect with a health coach for personalized guidance.

How Wellos works
The Wellos app is divided into several sections, including Learning, Tracking, and Coaching. Below is a detailed look at how the app works and what features are included in each section.
Using the Wellos app, you can easily log your meals by searching the database, which includes over 1 million foods. You can also use the barcode tool to add common food items by scanning packaged food labels.
In addition to seeing how many calories you’ve consumed, and how many you have left before reaching your goal, you can also filter to view  specific nutrients , such as carbs, protein, fat, and fiber. You can also choose to hide your calorie intake if you’d prefer not to count calories.
To help guide your food choices, the app uses nutrition tags to help identify foods you’ve logged that are high in protein or fiber.
For weight tracking, you can either enter your weight directly into the app or sync your weight information from Apple Health or Health Connect.
Physical activity is currently the most limited tracking tool at the moment, as you can’t add your activities manually into the app. Instead, you have to log your activity with your Apple Health or Health Connect account and then sync it to the Wellos app in order to track it.
After tracking your intake and activity for 7 days, you’ll gain access to a weekly insights report, which identifies trends in your habits along with guidance for how to take the next step toward your wellness goals.
To help you along your journey, the app breaks goals down into Supports, which allow you to focus on improving one specific area of your diet or lifestyle at a time.
Examples of Supports include:
Sweet Relief:  decrease  added sugar  intake
Sip Smart:  drink more water and fewer sugary beverages
Fiber Fuel:  increase intake of fiber-rich foods
Calorie Countdown:  reduce calorie consumption
After selecting a Support that aligns with your goals and preferences, you’ll receive a challenge each day to help you stay on track. You can also view a list of curated articles, tips, and resources related to your Support.
For one-on-one support, Wellos offers access to a team of health and behavior change coaches, all of whom are certified by the  National Board for Health & Wellness Coaching  and participate in ongoing trainings.
You can message your coach at any time to share your goals, ask questions, or request guidance or support. The typical turnaround time for a response from your Wellos coach is about 1 day.
Wellos offers a variety of health lessons to help tackle issues related to health and wellness, such as fostering a  healthy relationship with food .
Lessons are divided into phases, each of which includes multiple parts with short videos and articles on a specific topic.
Some of the phases include:
Weight Health Foundations
Quality Nutrition
Reframe Your Food
Cravings
Emotional Eating
During your 14-day free trial, you’ll have access to the foundations lessons. Once your trial concludes, other lessons are unlocked, and you’ll receive access to the full library.
Wellos offers a collection of over 5,000 recipes. You can take a short quiz on the app to view a list of curated recipes based on your dietary preferences.
You can also search for specific recipes, filter by category, or browse the full collection.
Each recipe includes a list of ingredients, step-by-step instructions, a detailed nutrition breakdown, and ratings from other users.
While there isn’t a meal planning tool at the moment, the Wellos team reports that this feature is on the horizon.
One Pass Select is a premium add-on, which provides access to up to 19,000 gyms and fitness studios for a single subscription.
There are three different tiered subscription plans, each of which varies in price and the specific gyms and fitness studios included.
The subscription plans available include:
Classic:  includes access to over 10,000 locations, such as LA Fitness, Planet Fitness, and Crunch Fitness
Standard:  includes access to over 13,000 locations, such as Pure Barre, Row House, and YMCA
Premium:  includes access to over 15,000 locations, such as Rumble Boxing Gym and Club Pilates
You can view the specific locations included in each plan near you by entering your ZIP code on the app.

Is Wellos effective?
While there are no studies on Wellos specifically, research suggests that some of the key features of the app could be  beneficial for weight loss .
For example, the app encourages choosing foods that are lower in calories and adding more physical activity to your routine, both of which have been  proven  effective for weight management.
Increasing your fiber intake and adding more protein to your diet are two other strategies promoted by Wellos. These strategies can help  reduce  appetite and  enhance  feelings of fullness between meals to support weight loss.
Other aspects of the app, including food and weight tracking, have also been  linked  to increased weight loss.
Additionally, some research suggests that health coaching  could be effective  for promoting weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity.
In fact, a  2023 review  of 14 studies concluded that combining health coaching with self-monitoring apps used to track your food intake or weight could increase weight loss, reduce belly fat, and decrease the calories consumed per day, compared with a control group.
Wellos also provides detailed lessons designed to address other issues that may affect weight management, including  emotional eating ,  food cravings , and  sugar consumption .

How does Wellos compare?
Here is a closer look at how Wellos compares with two of its main competitors,  Noom  and  WeightWatchers :

Is Wellos worth it?
If you’re looking for a simple and effective way to brush up on your nutrition knowledge, improve your relationship with food, or reach a specific health-related goal, like losing weight, then Wellos is worth trying.
Unlike other popular health apps, it doesn’t restrict or eliminate any foods from your diet or categorize foods as “good” versus “bad.”
Instead, it teaches you to make  smarter food choices  and promotes healthy habits to help you reach your goals, such as intuitive eating and reading ingredient labels.
Plus, at $24.99 per month, which includes access to a health coach, it’s also more affordable than many other weight loss programs.
Still, keep in mind that Wellos is not currently recommended for certain groups, including:
people under 18 years old
those recovering from or managing an eating disorder
individuals who are pregnant or breastfeeding
Wellos is currently only available in the United States and requires the use of a smartphone, which may be an issue for those who aren’t as tech savvy or who prefer in-person support.
It might also not be suitable for people with more advanced nutrition knowledge, as many of the lessons are focused on basic concepts related to nutrition and wellness.
Additionally, it’s currently lacking some of the features found in other apps, such as community support, meal planning tools, and manual activity tracking.

The bottom line
Whether you’re looking to improve your health or manage your weight, Wellos can be an effective and sustainable option.
Instead of setting strict guidelines on which foods you should eat or focusing solely on the amount of calories you consume, Wellos aims to help you reach your goals by empowering you to make smarter choices and develop healthier habits.
While it might not be a good fit for everyone, it may be worth a try if you’re interested in ditching diet culture, redefining your relationship with food, and reaching your health- or weight-related goals.
