Title: Top 12 Foods That Are High in Phosphorus

Phosphorous is an essential mineral that your body uses to build healthy bones, create energy and make new cells. While it is beneficial for most people, it can be harmful if you consume too much.
Phosphorus is an important mineral that plays a key role in many aspects of health. The Daily Value (DV) for phosphorus is 1,250 milligrams (mg) per day ( 1 ).
Phosphorus deficiency is rare in developed countries, as most adults eat more than the recommended amounts every day ( 2 ).
Phosphorus is found in most foods, but some foods are especially good sources. However, people with kidney disease can have trouble removing it from their blood and may need to limit their phosphorus intake ( 3 ).
This article lists 12 foods that are particularly high in phosphorus.

1. Chicken and turkey
Each 3-ounce (oz), or 85-gram (g), serving of  roasted chicken  or turkey contains 194–196 mg of phosphorus, which is nearly 16% of the DV. It is also rich in protein, B vitamins, and selenium ( 4 ,  5 ).
Light poultry meat contains slightly more phosphorus than dark meat, but both are good sources.
Cooking methods can also affect phosphorus content of the meat. Roasting preserves the most phosphorus, while boiling reduces levels by about 25% ( 6 ).
Chicken and turkey are both excellent sources of phosphorus, especially the light meat. Each 3-oz (85-g) serving provides nearly 16% of the DV. Roasting preserves more of the phosphorus than boiling.

2. Pork
A typical 3-oz (85-g) portion of cooked pork, including  pork chops  and pork tenderloin, contains around 18% of the DV for phosphorus ( 7 ,  8 ).
Like with poultry, cooking method can affect the phosphorus content of pork.
Dry heat cooking preserves 90% of the phosphorus. Meanwhile, boiling has been shown to reduce phosphorus levels by roughly 25% in chicken and beef, though more research is needed on pork specifically ( 6 ).
Pork is a good source of phosphorus, containing around 230 mg per 3 oz (85 g). Dry heat cooking is the best way to preserve the phosphorus content.

3. Organ meats
Organ meats, such as brain and  liver , are excellent sources of highly absorbable phosphorus.
One 3-oz (85-g) serving of pan-fried cow’s brain contains almost 26% of the DV ( 9 ).
Chicken liver, which is often used to make the French delicacy pâté, contains 30% of the DV per 3 oz (85 g) ( 10 ).
Organ meats  are also rich in other essential nutrients, such as vitamin A, vitamin B12, iron, and trace minerals. They can make a delicious and nutritious addition to your diet.
Organ meats are incredibly nutrient-dense, and contain large amounts of phosphorus and other vitamins and minerals. Brain and liver both contain 26%–30% of the DV per 3-oz (85-g) serving.

4. Seafood
Many types of seafood are good sources of phosphorus.
Cuttlefish, a mollusk related to squid and octopus, is one of the richest sources, supplying 39% of the DV in each 3-oz (85-g) cooked serving ( 11 ).
Other  fish  that are good sources of phosphorus include (per 3 oz or 85 g) ( 12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  19 ,  20 ,  21 ):
Some of these foods, like salmon, sardines, and mackerel, are also good sources of the anti-inflammatory  omega-3 fatty acids  that may protect against cancer, heart disease, and other chronic illnesses ( 13 ,  17 ,  19 ,  22 ).
Many different types of seafood are rich in phosphorus. Cuttlefish is one of the best sources, with 493 mg of phosphorus per serving.

5. Dairy
Dairy products like cheese and milk are among the top sources of phosphorus in the average diet ( 2 ).
Just 1 oz (28 g) of Romano cheese contains 215 mg of phosphorus (17% of the DV), while 1 cup (244 g) of skim milk contains 21% of the DV ( 23 ,  24 ).
Low fat and non-fat milk and yogurt contain the most phosphorus, while full fat versions contain slightly less ( 25 ,  26 ,  27 ,  28 ).
Meanwhile, full fat  cottage cheese  is a bit higher in phosphorus than low fat cottage cheese ( 29 ,  30 ).
Dairy products like milk, cottage cheese and yogurt are excellent sources of phosphorus, providing at least 10% of the DV per serving.

6. Sunflower and pumpkin seeds
Sunflower and pumpkin seeds also contain large amounts of phosphorus.
Each ounce (28 g) of roasted sunflower or  pumpkin seeds  contains roughly 26%–27% of the DV for phosphorus ( 31 ,  32 ).
However, keep in mind that 60%–90% of the phosphorus found in seeds is in a stored form called  phytic acid , or phytate, which humans cannot digest ( 33 ).
Nevertheless, pumpkin and sunflower seeds can still be enjoyed as a snack, sprinkled on salads, blended into nut butters, or used in pesto and are a great alternative for people who are allergic to peanuts or tree nuts.
Sunflower and pumpkin seeds contain large amounts of the storage form of phosphorus called phytic acid, which humans can’t digest. However, they can be a versatile and nutritious addition to your diet.

7. Nuts
Most nuts are good sources of phosphorus, but  Brazil nuts  top the list. Just 1 oz (28 g) of Brazil nuts provides 16% of the DV ( 34 ).
Other  nuts  containing at least 10% of the DV per oz (28 g) include cashews, almonds, pine nuts, and pistachios ( 35 ,  36 ,  37 ,  38 ).
They are also great sources of healthy fats, antioxidants, and minerals. Eating them regularly is linked with better heart health ( 39 ).
Like seeds, most of the phosphorus in nuts is stored as phytic acid, which is not digestible by humans. Soaking may help, though not all studies agree ( 40 ).
Many nuts, and especially Brazil nuts, are good sources of phosphorus, containing at least 16% of the DV per ounce (28 g).

8. Whole grains
Many whole grains contain phosphorus, including wheat, oats, and rice.
Spelt contains the most phosphorus, with 291 mg, or 23% of the DV per cooked cup (194 g) ( 41 ).
Oats are also a good source of phosphorus, with 14% of the DV per cooked cup (234 g), followed by  brown rice , which provides 8% of the DV per cooked cup (202 g) ( 42 ,  43 ).
Most of the phosphorus in whole grains is found in the outer layer of the endosperm, known as the aleurone, and the inner layer, called the germ ( 44 ).
These layers are removed when grains are refined, which is why  whole grains  are good sources of phosphorus and why refined grains are not ( 45 ,  46 ).
However, like seeds, most of the phosphorus in whole grains is stored as phytic acid, which is hard for the body to digest and absorb.
Soaking, sprouting, or fermenting the grains can break down some of the phytic acid and make more of the phosphorus available for absorption ( 47 ,  48 ).
Whole grains like wheat, oats, and rice contain a lot of phosphorus. Soaking, sprouting, or fermenting the grains may make it more available for absorption.

9. Amaranth and quinoa
While amaranth and  quinoa  are often referred to as “grains,” they are actually small seeds and are considered pseudocereals ( 49 ).
Each cup (246 grams) of cooked  amaranth  contains 29% of the DV for phosphorus, while the same volume of cooked quinoa contains 22% of the DV ( 50 ,  51 ).
Both of these foods are also good sources of fiber, minerals, and protein, and are naturally gluten-free ( 49 ).
Like other seeds, soaking, sprouting, and fermenting can increase phosphorus availability ( 52 ,  53 ).
Ancient grains like amaranth and quinoa are highly nutritious and are good sources of phosphorus. Each cooked cup (185–246 g) contains at least 20% of the DV.

10. Beans and lentils
Beans and lentils  also contain large amounts of phosphorus, and eating them regularly is associated with lower risk of many chronic diseases, including cancer ( 54 ,  55 ).
Just 1 cup (198 g) of boiled lentils contains 28% of the DV and over 15 g of fiber ( 56 ).
Beans are also rich in phosphorus, especially Great Northern, chickpeas, navy, and pinto beans, which all contain at least 250 mg per cup (164–182 g) ( 57 ,  58 ,  59 ,  60 ).
Like the other plant sources of phosphorus, legumes do contain phytic acid. However, cooking methods like boiling may decrease the phytic acid content in most types of legumes ( 61 ).
Beans and lentils are rich sources of phosphorus, containing at least 250 mg per cup (roughly 160–200 g).

11. Soy
Soy can be enjoyed in many forms, some higher in phosphorus than others.
Mature soybeans contain the most phosphorus, while  edamame , the immature form of soy, contains 31% less ( 62 ,  63 ).
Mature soybeans can be seasoned, roasted, and enjoyed as a delicious crunchy snack that provides over 50% of the DV per cup (172 g) ( 64 ).
Fermented soy products, like  tempeh  and natto, are also good sources, providing 253 mg and 304 mg per 3.5-oz (100-g) and 1-cup (175-g) serving, respectively ( 65 ,  66 ).
Most other prepared soy products, like tofu and soy milk, are not as good sources of phosphorus, containing less than 15% of the DV per serving ( 67 ,  68 ).
Whole soybeans and fermented soy products are good sources of phosphorus, providing up to 50% of the DV per serving.

12. Foods with added phosphates
While phosphorus is naturally present in many foods, some processed foods also contain large amounts from  additives .
Phosphate additives are nearly 100% absorbable, and contribute around 155 mg of phosphorus per day, on average ( 2 ).
Excessive intake of phosphorus has been linked to bone loss, so it is important not to consume much more than the recommended intakes. Some research suggests that it may also increase the risk of death, though this may vary depending on factors like kidney function ( 69 ,  70 ,  71 ,  72 ).
Processed foods and beverages that often contain added phosphates include ( 73 ,  74 ,  75 ,  76 ,  77 ,  78 ):
Processed meats:  Beef, lamb, pork, and chicken products are often marinated or injected with phosphate additives to keep the meat tender and juicy.
Cola beverages:  Cola drinks often contain phosphoric acid, a synthetic source of phosphorus.
Baked goods:  Biscuits, pancake mixes, toaster pastries, and other baked goods can contain phosphate additives as leavening agents.
Fast food:  According to one study of 15 major American fast food chains, over 80% of the menu items contained added phosphates.
Convenience food:  Phosphates are often added to convenience foods like frozen chicken nuggets to help them cook faster and improve shelf life.
To tell if prepared and processed foods or beverages contain phosphorus, look for ingredients with the word “phosphate” in them.
Processed foods and beverages often contain phosphate additives to enhance quality and increase shelf life. They can contribute large amounts of phosphorus to your diet.

The bottom line
Phosphorus is an essential nutrient  required for bone health  and many other bodily functions.
It can be found in many foods, but is especially high in animal proteins, dairy products, nuts and seeds, whole grains, and legumes.
Many processed foods also contain phosphorus from phosphate additives used to prolong shelf life or enhance the taste or texture.
Artificial phosphates and animal sources of phosphorus are the most absorbable, while some plant-based sources can be soaked, sprouted, or  fermented  to increase the amount of absorbable phosphorus.
While phosphorus is good when consumed in moderation, getting too much from artificial additives may be bad for your health. People with kidney disease also need to limit their intake.
Understanding which foods are highest in phosphorus can help you manage your intake as needed.
