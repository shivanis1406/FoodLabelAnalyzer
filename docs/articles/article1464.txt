As you age, your body starts to break down bone faster than it can replace it, which can lead to an increased risk of  osteoporosis , fractures, and falls ( 1 ).
For this reason, women over 50 and men over 70 have increased needs for calcium — an important nutrient that makes up the structure of bones and teeth ( 2 ).
This supplement from New Chapter provides 905 mg of plant-based calcium in each serving to help support bone health, along with other  bone-building nutrients  such as vitamin D3, magnesium, and vitamin K ( 3 ).
It’s also free of artificial flavors and colors and is vegetarian, organic, and certified gluten-free by  NSF International .
According to New Chapter’s website, all of its products are tested by a third-party laboratory to ensure quality and purity, though the name of the testing organization isn’t disclosed.

Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) is a common issue among older men, causing symptoms such as difficulty urinating and an increased or urgent need to urinate ( 4 ).
Flomentum contains 320 mg of  saw palmetto extract , a compound that has been shown to decrease prostate inflammation and improve symptoms of BPH ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
Flomentum is also the first and only  supplement for prostate health  that is verified by the  United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) , a third-party organization that sets strict standards for supplement safety, strength, and purity.

Menopause  is caused by a natural decline in reproductive hormones, marking the end of a woman’s menstrual cycles.
It typically occurs around age 51, although some women may experience menopause earlier ( 8 ).
Menopause can cause a range of symptoms, including hot flashes, vaginal dryness, night sweats, and changes in mood ( 8 ).
Equelle is a hormone-free dietary supplement designed to provide  relief from menopause symptoms .
It contains a compound called S-equol, which is derived from soy. Several studies have found that S-equol may help reduce the frequency of hot flashes and decrease joint and muscle pain during menopause ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ).
Equelle is manufactured by Pharmavite, a USP-certified company. However, it’s unclear whether Eqeulle specifically is third-party tested.

Getting older causes changes in many areas of your body, including your brain.
In fact, as you age, your brain shrinks, and conditions such as dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease become increasingly common ( 12 ).
This product from Nature’s Bounty includes 120 mg of  ginkgo biloba extract .
This compound that has been studied for its ability to slow cognitive decline, especially for people with dementia, when used in doses ranging from 120–240 mg per day ( 13 ,  14 ,  15 ).

Collagen is a protein found in the connective tissue throughout your body, including your skin, joints, and bones ( 16 ).
Collagen production begins to naturally decline with age, which can cause a reduction in skin elasticity and hydration ( 16 ).
Using a  collagen supplement  such as Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides is an easy way to boost your intake of collagen to support healthy skin as you get older ( 17 ,  18 ).
Additionally, the supplement is made without any added sugars or sweeteners and contains  hyaluronic acid , a compound that promotes tissue repair and is included in many cosmetic products ( 19 ).
Vital Protein’s products are produced in NSF-certified current Good Manufacturing Practices facilities.

Loss of muscle mass is a common issue for many older adults. It can decrease mobility and diminish quality of life ( 20 ).
Some research shows that increasing  protein intake  could help prevent muscle loss and preserve muscle function and strength in adults over 65 ( 21 ,  22 ).
While it is possible to meet your protein needs through food sources alone, protein supplements provide a convenient way to boost your intake.
This  whey protein powder  from Naked Nutrition is one of the best options.
Not only does it contain 25 grams of protein per serving, but it’s also available in three flavors and is free of artificial ingredients and added sugar.

Omega-3 fatty acids  are linked to a long list of health benefits, including reducing inflammation and supporting heart health as you age ( 30 ).
However, if you don’t regularly consume foods like fatty fish, it can be challenging to meet your daily omega-3 needs through diet alone.
Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega packs 1,280 mg of omega-3 fatty acids into each serving and is flavored with lemon to prevent fishy burps and an unpleasant aftertaste.
These capsules are also sustainably sourced from  wild-caught seafood  and made without any artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives.

How to choose quality supplements
There are several factors to consider when deciding whether to take supplements.
For one thing, some ingredients can interact with certain medications and may negatively impact people with specific health conditions.
Therefore, it’s very important to talk with a trusted healthcare professional before adding any supplements to your routine and to use products only as directed.
Additionally, keep in mind that not all supplements are created equal. For this reason, it’s  best to buy only from reputable brands  that use high quality ingredients.
Be sure to also check the label carefully and steer clear of any products that contain high amounts of fillers, additives, or artificial ingredients.
Opt for products that are tested for safety and quality, ideally by a third-party organization such as USP or NSF International. Looks for a seal from one of these organizations on the product label.
