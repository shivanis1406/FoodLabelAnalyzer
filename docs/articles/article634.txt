Title: What fruits are good for weight loss?

Many fruits are low in calories yet rich in fiber, which may benefit weight loss. Some fruits, including apples, berries, and melons, may also increase feelings of fullness.
Fruit is nature’s ready-made snack packed with vitamins, fiber, and other nutrients that support a healthy diet.
Fruit is also generally low in calories and high in fiber, which may help you lose weight.
Eating fruit is linked to a lower body weight and a lower risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, and heart disease ( 1 ,  2 ).
Here are 11 of the best fruits to eat for weight loss.

1. Grapefruit
Grapefruit is a cross between a pomelo and an orange and is commonly associated with dieting and weight loss.
Half a  grapefruit , or 123 grams (g), contains just 37 calories but provides 51% of the Daily Value (DV) of vitamin C. Red varieties also provide a small amount of vitamin A ( 3 ).
Grapefruit also has a low glycemic index (GI), which means it releases sugar into your bloodstream more slowly. A  low GI diet  may aid weight loss and maintenance, though the evidence is limited ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ).
Plus, grapefruit is high in naringenin, a flavonoid with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may protect against diabetes and heart disease ( 7 ).
While grapefruit can be eaten on its own, it also makes a great addition to salads and other dishes.
Grapefruit is very low in calories and high in vitamin C. It may be a healthy snack before main meals to help reduce your overall food intake.

2. Apples
Apples  are low in calories and high in fiber, with 116 calories and 5.4 g of fiber per large fruit (223 g) ( 8 ).
They have also been found to support weight loss.
Apples contain polyphenols that may help prevent visceral fat accumulation in people with varied BMI and weights, according to a review of research ( 9 ).
Research from 2022 noted that apple peels contain antioxidants and beneficial compounds that may reduce the risk of obesity ( 10 ).
Research shows that apples are best eaten whole — rather than juiced — to reduce hunger and appetite ( 11 ,  12 ).
Apple polyphenol extract — made from one of the fruit’s natural compounds — has also been linked to improved HDL (good) cholesterol levels and decreased inflammation ( 13 ).
Apples  can be enjoyed cooked or raw in a variety of ways. Try adding them to hot and cold cereals, yogurt, stews, and salads or baking them on their own.
Apples are low in calories, high in fiber, and very filling. Studies indicate that they may support weight loss.

3. Berries
Berries  are low calorie nutrient powerhouses.
For example, one cup (123 g) of raspberries contains just 64 calories but provides 36% of the DV for vitamin C, manganese, and 12% for vitamin K ( 14 ).
One cup (152 g) of strawberries contains under 50 calories and provides 3 g of dietary fiber and 99% of the DV for vitamin C and 26% for  manganese  ( 15 ).
Berries are also filling. One small 2015 study found that people given a 65-calorie berry snack ate less food at a subsequent meal than those given candy with the same number of calories ( 16 ).
Additionally, eating berries may help decrease cholesterol levels, reduce blood pressure, and lower inflammation, which may be particularly helpful for people with overweight ( 17 ,  18 ).
Both fresh or frozen berries can be added to  oatmeal  or  yogurt  for breakfast, blended in a healthy smoothie, mixed into baked goods, or tossed in a salad.
Berries are low in calories and contain many important vitamins. They also may have positive effects on cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and inflammation.

4. Stone fruits
Stone fruits, also known as drupes, are a group of seasonal fruits with a fleshy exterior and a stone, or pit, on the inside. They include peaches, nectarines,  plums , cherries, and apricots.
Stone fruits are low GI, low calorie, and rich in nutrients like vitamins C and A, which make them a healthful choice for people trying to lose weight ( 4 ).
For example, one medium peach (150 g) contains 58 calories, while 1 cup (138 g) of cherries provides 87 calories, and two small plums (132 g) or four apricots (140 g) have less than 70 calories ( 19 ,  20 ,  21 ,  22 ).
Stone fruits are a more filling, nutrient-dense option than packaged snack foods like chips or cookies.
Stone fruits can be eaten fresh, chopped in fruit salads, mixed into a hearty porridge, or even grilled or added to savory dishes like stews.
Stone fruits like peaches, nectarines, and plums make for a low calorie, seasonal snack. They are a good alternative to chips, cookies, or other packaged foods.

5. Passion fruit
Passion fruit originates in South America and grows on a flowering vine. It has a tough outer rind — purple or yellow — with an edible, pulpy seed mass inside ( 23 ).
One purple passion fruit (18 g) contains just 18 calories and is a rich source of fiber, vitamin C, vitamin A, iron, and potassium ( 24 ).
For such a small fruit,  passion fruit  has ample dietary fiber. Five of these fruits provide 33% of the DV for less than 100 calories ( 24 ).
Fiber  slows your digestion, helping you feel fuller for longer and controlling your appetite ( 25 ).
Additionally, passion fruit seeds provide piceatannol, a substance linked to reduced blood pressure and improved insulin sensitivity in males with overweight. However, more research is needed ( 26 ).
For weight loss, passion fruit is best consumed whole. It can be eaten alone, used as a topping or filling for desserts, or added to drinks.
Passion fruit is a low calorie, high fiber fruit that may benefit blood pressure and insulin sensitivity, potentially making it ideal for weight loss.

6. Rhubarb
Rhubarb  is a vegetable, but it is often prepared like a fruit in Europe and North America.
While it has only 11 calories per stalk, it still packs almost 1 g of fiber and almost 12% of the DV for  vitamin K  ( 27 ).
Additionally, rhubarb fiber may help reduce high cholesterol.
A 2022 review notes that rhubarb contains compounds that may support glucose regulation and fat metabolism, which may support cardiovascular health ( 28 ).
Rhubarb stalks can be stewed and served with porridge or your favorite cereal. Although it can be used in many ways, including in desserts, it’s best to stick to low sugar rhubarb dishes when trying to lose weight.
Rhubarb, which is low in calories and high in fiber, may aid weight loss, and could help lower cholesterol.

7. Kiwifruit
Kiwifruits are small, brown fruits with bright green or yellow flesh and tiny black seeds.
Very nutrient-dense, kiwis are an excellent source of vitamin C, vitamin K, folate, and fiber and have significant health benefits ( 29 ,  30 ).
In one study, 41 people with prediabetes ate two golden kiwis daily for 12 weeks. They experienced higher vitamin C levels, reduced blood pressure, and a 1.2-inch (3.1-centimeter) reduction in waist circumference ( 31 ).
Additional studies note that kiwi can help control blood sugar, improve cholesterol, and support gut health — all additional weight loss benefits ( 32 ,  33 ,  34 ,  35 ).
Kiwis have a low GI, so while they contain sugar, it is released more slowly, resulting in smaller  blood sugar spikes  ( 32 ,  3 6 ).
Furthermore, kiwis are rich in dietary fiber. One small, peeled fruit (69 g) has over 2 g of fiber, while the skin alone provides 1 g of additional fiber ( 29 ,  3 7 ).
Diets high in fiber from fruits and vegetables have been shown to promote weight loss, increase fullness, and improve gut health ( 38 ).
Kiwifruit is soft, sweet, and delicious when eaten raw, peeled, or  unpeeled . It can also be juiced, used in salads, added to your morning cereal, or used in baked goods.
Kiwifruits are highly nutritious and provide a range of health benefits. Their high fiber and low calorie content make them ideal for weight loss.

8. Melons
Melons are low in calories and have a high water content, which makes them great for weight control.
Just 1 cup (150–170 g) of melon, such as  honeydew  or watermelon, provides a modest 46–61 calories ( 39 ,  40 ).
Though low in calories, melons are rich in fiber, potassium, and antioxidants, such as vitamin C ( 39 ,  40 ).
While melons contain a lot of water, which can support weight loss,  watermelon  has a high GI, so portion control is important ( 41 ).
Melons can be enjoyed fresh, cubed, or balled to liven up a fruit salad. They’re also easily blended into fruit smoothies or frozen into fruit popsicles.
Melons are very low in calories and have a high water content, which may help support weight loss and keep you hydrated.

9. Oranges
Like all  citrus fruits , oranges are low in calories while high in vitamin C and fiber. They are also very filling ( 42 ).
While many people consume  orange juice  instead of orange slices, studies have found that eating whole fruits — rather than drinking fruit juices — not only results in less hunger and lower calorie intake but also increases feelings of fullness ( 11 ,  42 ).
Therefore, if you are trying to lose weight, it may be better to eat oranges rather than drink orange juice. The fruit can be eaten alone or added to your favorite salad or dessert.
Oranges are high in vitamin C and fiber. They can help keep you feeling full, which may support weight loss.

10. Bananas
Some people avoid bananas when trying to lose weight due to their high sugar and calorie content.
While bananas are more calorie-dense than many other fruits, they are also more nutrient-dense, supplying  potassium , magnesium, manganese, fiber, numerous antioxidants, and vitamins B6 and C ( 43 ).
Their low to medium GI may help control blood sugar levels and regulate weight — particularly for people with diabetes ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ).
High quality, nutrient-dense, and low calorie foods like bananas are vital to any healthy weight management plan.
Bananas  can be enjoyed on their own as a convenient on-the-go snack or added either raw or cooked to a wide variety of dishes.
Bananas’ ample nutrients and fiber make them an ideal part of a healthy weight loss plan.

11. Avocados
Avocados  are a fatty, calorie-dense fruit grown in warm climates.
Half an avocado (100 g) contains 161 calories, making it one of the most calorie-dense fruits. The same amount provides 18% of the DV for vitamin K and 20% for folate ( 44 ).
Despite their high calorie and fat content, avocados may promote weight loss.
In one study, 51 people with overweight or obesity followed a low calorie diet, either with or without one avocado per day for 12 weeks. Both groups experienced significant weight loss, indicating that avocados are a smart choice for those looking to lose weight ( 45 ).
Other studies have found that eating avocados can increase feelings of fullness, decrease appetite, and improve cholesterol levels ( 46 ).
Some research also suggests that regular consumption of avocados may be associated with improved diet quality and a reduced risk of heart disease ( 47 ,  48 ).
Avocados can be used as a replacement for  butter  or margarine on bread and toast. You can also add them to salads, smoothies, or dips.
People who eat avocados tend to weigh less than people who do not. Despite their high fat content, avocados may help promote weight loss and weight maintenance.

Frequently asked questions
Some fruits contain compounds that may help reduce body fat. These may include apples and grapefruit. Rhubarb, a vegetable commonly prepared like a fruit, also contains compounds that may support the body’s metabolism of fat.
