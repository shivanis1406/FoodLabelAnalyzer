Title: 12 Science-Backed Benefits of Peppermint Tea and Extracts

Peppermint tea is naturally sweet and free of caffeine. It may be linked to health benefits, including improving digestion, boosting focus, and relieving migraine.
Peppermint ( Mentha × piperita ) is an aromatic herb in the mint family that is a cross between watermint and spearmint ( 1 ).
Native to Europe and Asia, it has been used for thousands of years for its pleasant, minty taste and health benefits.
Peppermint is used as a flavoring in breath mints, candies, and other foods. Additionally, many people consume peppermint as a refreshing,  caffeine-free tea .
Peppermint leaves contain several essential oils including menthol, menthone, and limonene ( 2 ).
Menthol gives peppermint its cooling properties and recognizably minty scent.
While peppermint tea is often drunk for its flavor, it may also have several health benefits. The tea itself has rarely been studied scientifically, but peppermint extracts have.
Here are 12 science-backed benefits of peppermint tea and extracts.

1. May ease digestive issues
Peppermint may relieve digestive symptoms, such as gas,  bloating , and indigestion.
Animal studies indicate that peppermint relaxes your digestive system and may ease pain. It also prevents smooth muscles from contracting, which could relieve spasms in your gut ( 3 ).
A 2014 review of nine studies in 726 people with  irritable bowel syndrome  (IBS) treated with peppermint oil for at least 2 weeks concluded that peppermint provided significantly better symptom relief than a placebo ( 4 ).
In one study in 72 people with IBS, peppermint oil capsules reduced IBS symptoms by 40% after 4 weeks, compared to only 24.3% with a placebo ( 5 ).
Additionally, in a review of 14 clinical trials in nearly 2,000 children, peppermint reduced the frequency, length, and severity of abdominal pain ( 6 ).
Furthermore, another study showed that the scent of peppermint oil drops reduced the incidence of  nausea  and vomiting and decreased the severity of nausea in people undergoing chemotherapy ( 7 ).
While no studies have examined peppermint tea and digestion, it’s possible that the tea could have similar effects.
Peppermint oil has been shown to relax muscles in your digestive system and improve various digestive symptoms. Therefore, peppermint tea may provide similar benefits.

2. May help relieve tension headaches and migraines
As peppermint acts as a  muscle relaxant  and pain reliever, it may diminish certain types of headaches ( 8 ).
The menthol in peppermint oil increases blood flow and provides a cooling sensation, possibly easing pain ( 9 ).
In one 2010 randomized clinical study in 35 people with migraines, peppermint oil applied to the forehead and temples significantly reduced pain after 2 hours, compared to a placebo ( 10 ).
Another study found that administering peppermint oil drops into the nose reduced the intensity and frequency of  headaches  and was as effective as lidocaine, a common pain reliever ( 11 ).
While the aroma of peppermint tea may help relax muscles and improve headache pain, there is no supporting scientific evidence to confirm this effect. However, applying peppermint oil to your temples may help.
While no evidence exists that peppermint tea improves headache symptoms, research suggests that peppermint oil reduces tension headaches and migraines.

3. May freshen your breath
There’s a reason why peppermint is a common flavoring for toothpastes, mouthwashes, and chewing gums.
In addition to its pleasant smell, peppermint has antibacterial properties that help kill germs that cause dental plaque, which may improve your breath ( 12 ).
In one study, people who had undergone spine surgery and had received a rinse made with peppermint,  tea tree , and  lemon  oils experienced improvement in bad breath symptoms compared to those who did not receive the oils ( 13 ).
In another 2013 study, female students given a peppermint mouth rinse experienced an improvement in breath after 1 week, compared to the control group ( 14 ).
While there is no evidence from scientific studies that drinking peppermint tea has the same effect, the compounds in peppermint have been shown to improve breath.
Peppermint oil has been shown to kill germs that lead to bad breath. Peppermint tea, which contains peppermint oil, may help improve breath as well.

4. May relieve clogged sinuses
Peppermint has antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties. Because of this, peppermint tea may alleviate clogged sinuses due to infections, the  common cold , and allergies ( 15 ).
Additionally, some older research demonstrates that menthol — one of the active compounds in peppermint — improves the perception of airflow in your nasal cavity. Therefore, steam from peppermint tea may help you feel as though your breathing is easier ( 16 ).
Furthermore, warm liquids, such as chicken  broth  and tea, have been shown to temporarily improve symptoms of sinus congestion such as a runny nose, cough, and sore throat in some older studies ( 17 ).
Though peppermint tea has not been studied for its effects on  nasal congestion , evidence suggests that it may be helpful.
While there is limited evidence that drinking peppermint tea may help unclog your sinuses, a warm beverage containing menthol — such as peppermint tea — may help you breathe a little easier.

5. May improve energy
Peppermint tea may improve energy levels and reduce fatigue.
While there are no studies on peppermint tea specifically, research demonstrates that natural compounds in peppermint may have beneficial effects on  energy .
In one study, 24 healthy young people experienced less mental  fatigue  during a cognitive test when given peppermint oil capsules ( 18 ).
In another study, peppermint oil aromatherapy was found to reduce the incidence of fatigue more effectively than a placebo in people admitted to a cardiology center ( 19 ).
Peppermint oil has been shown to relieve mental and physical fatigue in some studies, but research specifically on peppermint tea is lacking.

6. May help relieve menstrual cramps
Because peppermint acts as a muscle relaxant, it may relieve  menstrual cramps  ( 15 ).
While peppermint tea has not been studied to that effect, compounds in peppermint have been shown to improve symptoms.
In one study in 127 females with painful periods, peppermint extract capsules were found to be as effective as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug in reducing the intensity and duration of pain ( 20 ).
Though additional research is needed, it is possible that peppermint tea could have similar effects.
Drinking peppermint tea may reduce the intensity and length of menstrual cramps since peppermint helps prevent muscle contractions. However, more research is needed.

7. May be beneficial against bacterial infections
While there are no studies on the antibacterial effects of peppermint tea, peppermint oil has been shown to effectively kill bacteria ( 21 ).
In one study, peppermint oil was found to kill and prevent the growth of common food-borne bacteria including  E. coli, Listeria , and  Salmonella  in  pineapple  and mango juices ( 22 ).
Peppermint oil also kills several types of bacteria that lead to illnesses in humans, including  Staphylococcus  and pneumonia-linked bacteria ( 23 ).
Additionally, studies indicate that peppermint reduces several types of bacteria commonly found in your mouth ( 12 ).
Furthermore, menthol has also demonstrated antibacterial activity in some older test-tube studies ( 24 ).
Studies confirm that peppermint effectively inhibits several types of bacteria, including those that cause food-borne illnesses and contagious illnesses

8. May improve your sleep
Peppermint tea is an  ideal choice  before bed, as it’s naturally caffeine-free.
What’s more, peppermint’s capacity as a muscle relaxant may help you relax before bedtime ( 15 ).
That said, there is not much scientific evidence that peppermint enhances  sleep .
However, one study found that inhaling three drops of peppermint oil per day over a 7-day period improved sleep quality in people with cancer ( 25 ).
Still, more high quality studies on the effects of peppermint on sleep are needed.
Little scientific evidence suggests that peppermint tea is beneficial for sleep. However, it’s a caffeine-free beverage that may help you relax before bedtime.

9. May aid weight loss
Peppermint tea is naturally calorie-free and has a pleasantly sweet flavor, which makes it a smart choice when you’re trying to  lose weight .
However, there is not much research on the effects of peppermint tea on weight.
In a 2013 study in 13 healthy people, taking a peppermint oil capsule resulted in  reduced appetite  compared to not taking peppermint ( 26 ).
On the other hand, an animal study showed that mice given peppermint extracts gained more weight than the control group ( 27 ).
Therefore, more research is needed on peppermint and weight loss.
Peppermint tea is a calorie-free beverage that may help satisfy your sweet tooth and reduce your appetite. However, more studies on peppermint and weight loss are needed.

10. May improve seasonal allergies
Peppermint contains rosmarinic acid, a plant compound found in  rosemary  and plants in the mint family ( 28 ).
Rosmarinic acid is linked to reduced symptoms of allergic reactions, such as runny nose, itchy eyes, and asthma ( 29 ).
In one 2004 study in 29 people with  seasonal allergies , those given an oral supplement containing rosmarinic acid for 21 days had fewer symptoms of itchy nose, itchy eyes, and other symptoms than those given a placebo ( 30 ).
While it’s unknown whether the amount of rosmarinic acid found in peppermint is enough to affect allergy symptoms, there is some evidence that peppermint may relieve allergies.
In fact, in one older study in rats, peppermint extract reduced allergic symptoms, such as sneezing and itchy nose ( 31 ).
Peppermint contains rosmarinic acid, which has been shown to reduce allergy symptoms, such as sneezing and runny nose. However, evidence on the efficacy of peppermint tea against allergy symptoms is limited.

11. May improve concentration
Drinking peppermint tea may help improve your ability to concentrate and  focus .
While studies on the effects of peppermint tea on concentration are unavailable, two small studies have researched this beneficial effect of peppermint oil, taken by ingestion or inhalation.
In one study, 24 young adults performed significantly better on cognitive tests when they were given peppermint oil capsules ( 18 ).
In another older study, smelling peppermint oil was found to improve  memory  and alertness compared to ylang-ylang, another popular essential oil ( 32 ).
Peppermint oil, found in peppermint tea, may help increase alertness and memory, which may improve concentration.

12. Easy to add to your diet
Peppermint tea is delicious and easy to add to your diet.
You can buy it in tea bags, as loose-leaf tea, or simply grow your own peppermint.
To make your own peppermint tea:
Bring 2 cups (473 milliliters) of water to a boil.
Turn off the heat and add a handful of torn peppermint leaves to the water.
Cover and steep for 5 minutes.
Strain the tea and drink.
Because peppermint tea is naturally free of  caffeine , you can drink it at any time of day.
Enjoy it as a post-meal treat to aid digestion, in the afternoon to boost your energy levels, or before bed to help you relax.
Peppermint tea is a tasty, calorie- and caffeine-free tea that can be enjoyed at any time of day.

The bottom line
Peppermint tea and the natural compounds found in peppermint leaves may benefit your health in several ways.
While research on peppermint tea is limited, several studies outline the benefits of peppermint oil and peppermint extracts.
Peppermint may help improve digestion, freshen your breath, and improve concentration.
Additionally, this  mint  has antibacterial properties and may improve allergy symptoms, headaches, and clogged airways.
Peppermint tea is a delicious, naturally sweet, caffeine-free beverage that can safely be consumed at any time of day.
