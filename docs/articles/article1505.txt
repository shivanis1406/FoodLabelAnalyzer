Title: 29 Healthy Snacks for Weight Loss

Snacking means eating smaller portions of food between meals. Opt for snacks with protein, fiber, and healthy fats to help keep you full throughout the day.
While research on whether snacking aids weight loss is mixed, some evidence suggests that increasing your meal frequency through snacking may help manage hunger and improve blood sugar regulation ( 1 ).
Additionally, snacking can help you increase your intake of nutrient-rich foods like fruits and vegetables — and most people are not eating enough produce ( 2 ).
By planning ahead and focusing on nutrient-rich foods, snacks may support your weight management goals by managing hunger and keeping you satisfied between meals ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
While no one snack will lead to weight loss, the following 29 healthy snacks may help you promote weight loss as part of an overall healthy eating pattern.

1. Mixed nuts
Nuts are an ideal nutritious snack, providing the perfect balance of healthy fats,  protein , and fiber.
They’re linked to numerous health benefits and are very filling. Studies suggest that eating nuts in moderation may help you lose weight. Since they’re high in calories, aim to stick to about 1 ounce or 1/4 cup ( 6 ,  7 ,  8 ).

2. Red bell pepper with guacamole
Although all bell peppers are nutritious, red varieties are particularly high in  antioxidants . Guacamole is also a rich source of nutrients and minerals ( 9 ,  10 ).
Pairing 1 large red bell pepper with 1/4 cup (60 grams) of guacamole combines the best of both foods while keeping the calorie count under 200 ( 9 ,  10 ).

3. Greek yogurt and mixed berries
Greek yogurt is  high in protein , and berries are one of the best sources of antioxidants around ( 11 ,  12 ).
Add a mixture of differently colored berries to your yogurt to get an array of nutrients — and a mix of their sweet and tart flavors.

4. Apple slices with peanut butter
Apples are a fiber-rich fruit. Peanuts provide healthy fats, plant-based protein, and fiber — pretty much all of the filling nutrients you should look for in a snack ( 13 ,  14 ).
By combining apples with  peanut butter , you’ll enjoy a crisp and creamy snack. Just look for one that only contains peanuts and salt and no added sugar ( 15 ).

5. Cottage cheese and fruit
Cottage cheese is high in filling protein, boasting 25 grams in just 1 cup ( 16 ).
Pairing cottage cheese with fruit complements the cheese’s protein and fat content with the fruit’s fiber, resulting in a sweet, creamy, and filling snack. Try it with tropical fruits such as pineapple, papaya, or watermelon.

6. Celery sticks with cream cheese
Celery sticks with cream cheese are a classic  low carb  snack that can help keep you feeling full.
This duo will have you enjoying a fiber-packed snack that combines a crunchy texture from the celery with creaminess from the cheese.
Snacking on 5 small celery sticks with about 1 ounce (30 grams) of cream cheese provides roughly 100 calories ( 17 ,  18 ).

7. Kale chips
Kale  is incredibly healthy, as it’s loaded with fiber, antioxidants, and minerals and has a lower level of oxalic acid, an anti-nutrient that impairs calcium absorption, than many other leafy greens ( 19 ,  20 ).
Pairing kale with olive oil makes not only more delicious and crispy chips but also a more balanced and filling snack.

8. Dark chocolate and almonds
Dark chocolate  and almonds are a fantastic pair. Dark chocolate contains antioxidants, and  almonds  are a rich source of healthy fats ( 21 ,  22 ,  23 ).
Try a couple of teaspoons of dark chocolate chips or a square of dark chocolate with a handful of nuts.

9. Cucumber slices with hummus
Cucumber’s fresh flavor and crunchy texture go very well with the rich creaminess of hummus.
Hummus is typically made from chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, and  garlic . Thus, it provides a mix of plant-based protein, fiber, and heart-healthy fats ( 26 ).
Enjoying 1 cup (104 grams) of sliced cucumbers dipped in 2 tablespoons (34 grams) of hummus will help keep you full for under 100 calories ( 27 ,  28 ).

10. A piece of fruit
A piece of fruit can be an incredibly satisfying snack. Portable, easy-to-eat fruits include apples, pears, grapes, grapefruit, and oranges. A small container of berries can be a great, satisfying snack when you’re on the go.
Fruit contains fiber and minerals and makes a great small snack. To make it more satisfying, pair your fruit with nuts or yogurt.

11. Cherry tomatoes with mozzarella
Tomatoes and mozzarella cheese are a nutritious and yummy way to add more veggies to your diet.
Mix  tomatoes  with mozzarella, balsamic vinegar, and a drizzle of olive oil for a snack with protein, fiber, and healthy fats.

12. Chia pudding
Chia seeds are tiny nutritional powerhouses loaded with fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and plant-based protein ( 29 ).
Although they don’t have much flavor,  chia seeds  take on a jelly-like consistency when soaked in liquid, making them a great ingredient for puddings.

13. Hard-boiled eggs
Eggs are incredibly filling, thanks to their protein content ( 30 ,  31 ).
Although they contain  cholesterol , recent studies suggest that moderate egg intake — defined as 3–4 eggs per week — is linked with reduced arterial stiffness, a risk factor for heart disease ( 32 ).
Make sure to eat the yolk to get important nutrients like vitamin D and choline ( 33 ).

14. Baby carrots with blue cheese dressing
Pairing carrots with a creamy salad dressing or dip is a great idea. Aside from keeping you fuller for longer, fat increases your absorption of carrot’s fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin A ( 34 ).
While blue cheese dressing on its own is high in calories, it may help you eat more carrots (or other veggies).
A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of baby carrots with 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of blue cheese dressing serves as a light snack containing about 190 calories ( 35 ,  36 ).

15. Cheese with crackers or fruit
Cheese is a delicious, high protein food that’s filling enough to be a snack on its own. However, pairing it with whole-grain crackers or a piece of fruit adds some fiber to your snack.
Cheese delivers protein and calcium, but the amounts of those nutrients vary slightly depending on the type you choose ( 37 ,  38 ,  39 ).

16. Beef jerky or beef sticks
Beef jerky  or beef sticks make excellent high protein, portable snacks. That said, depending on the brand and flavoring, some are higher in added sugar and sodium.
Look for jerky with as few added ingredients as possible and less than 300 mg of sodium per serving, which accounts for 13% of the Daily Value (DV) of the mineral ( 40 ).
Most beef jerkies and sticks contain about 9 grams of protein per ounce (28 grams) ( 41 ).

17. Protein smoothie
A  protein smoothie  can be a filling snack for when you need something substantial until your next meal.
They’re an easy and convenient way to increase your protein intake. You can add just about any other ingredient to the mix, from fruits and veggies to healthy fats like avocado, nut butter, or chia seeds, for a nutrient-rich snack.
You can also try Greek yogurt or silken tofu to boost the protein content of your smoothie ( 42 ,  43 ).

18. Whole wheat toast with canned fish
Canned fish is a fantastic option that requires no refrigeration. In particular,  salmon  and sardines are incredibly high in omega-3 fatty acids, which decrease your risk of heart disease ( 44 ,  45 ).
Topping a piece of whole wheat toast with canned fish will give you a highly nutritious snack that will leave you feeling full until your next meal. For something smaller, try a few whole-grain crackers with tuna or salmon.

19. Edamame
Edamame is a dish of steamed unripened soybeans that makes a great snack for anyone following a vegan or vegetarian diet.
It’s a fiber-rich food that’s considered a complete, plant-based protein source ( 46 ).
One cup (155 grams) of  edamame  provides around 18 grams of protein and 14 grams of carbs, 8 of which come from fiber ( 47 ).

20. Oatmeal
Oats are a nutritious whole grain that provides a good amount of fiber and a high protein content compared with other cereals ( 48 )
You can satisfy your sweet tooth with oatmeal topped with fruit, cinnamon, cocoa powder, and chocolate chips, or go for a savory version by adding eggs, avocado, and veggies like mushrooms or tomatoes.

21. Pear slices with ricotta cheese
Pear slices and ricotta cheese make a satisfying snack with a sweet taste and creamy texture, and it provides fiber and protein ( 49 ,  50 ).

22. Homemade trail mix
Make a trail mix by combining dried fruit and nuts for fiber, protein, and healthy fats. Choose fruits without added sugar and get creative with flavors ( 51 ). While homemade trail mix is perfect for on-the-go snacking, stick to modest portion size, as dried fruit and nuts are calorie-dense.

23. Turkey roll-ups
Turkey  roll-ups are delicious and nutritious.
Turkey contains high quality protein, which helps you feel satisfied and is linked to beneficial effects on weight management ( 52,   53 ).
Try rolling up a slice of turkey with a slice of cheese and some vegetables for added crunch and nutrients.

24. Olives with feta cheese
Olives are one of the nutritious staples of the  Mediterranean diet .
They’re very high in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and provide powerful antioxidants ( 54 ,  55 ).
Combine olives with feta cheese for a Greek-inspired snack that’s rich in protein and healthy fats. You could eat them by themselves or serve them with some  complex carbs  ( 56 ).

25. Spicy avocado
Avocados  are among the most nutritious and satisfying foods due to their high fat and fiber content ( 57 ).
Sprinkle half of a medium avocado with salt and a dash of cayenne pepper for a savory, filling snack under 120 calories ( 58 ).

26. Popcorn
But think air-popped popcorn — not the movie-theater kind doused in butter and salt. Popcorn delivers filling fiber and less than 100 calories in a generous 3-cup serving ( 59 ).
Add flavor with a little bit of olive oil, Parmesan cheese, or  nutritional yeast .

27. Roasted chickpeas
Roasting chickpeas helps turn them into a crunchy and delightful snack.  Chickpeas are a source of fiber and plant-based protein ( 60 ). You can make your own or look for roasted chickpeas in the snack section of your grocery store.

28. Cantaloupe slices wrapped in prosciutto
Cantaloupe is a nutritious, delicious fruit delivering fiber and vitamins A and C ( 61 ).
Combining cantaloupe with prosciutto (dry-cured ham) creates a balanced, sweet-and-salty snack.
Try wrapping 4 medium cantaloupe wedges (276 grams) with a thin slice of prosciutto each for a snack under 170 calories ( 62 ,  63 ).

29. Last night’s leftovers
One great way of taking advantage of your leftovers from a nutritious lunch or dinner is by having them as a snack.
By getting a smaller portion of a previous meal, you’ll enjoy a complete and balanced snack in seconds.
Just make sure to store your leftovers in the refrigerator to keep them from  spoiling  quickly.
