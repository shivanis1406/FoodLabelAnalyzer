Title: 50 of the Best Low-Calorie Beers

If you are counting calories, there are delicious, low calorie beer options. From lagers to stouts, there’s something for almost every preference.
Though beer is foamy, flavorful, and refreshing, it can be tricky to find ones that meet your needs if you’re on a low calorie diet.
That’s because alcoholic beverages tend to be high in calories. On its own, alcohol contains 7 calories per gram ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
Yet, the beer scene has diversified in recent years, so increasing numbers of scrumptious brews don’t pack too many calories.
Here are 50 of the best low calorie beers.

1–20. Lagers
Lagers are the most popular type of beer ( 4 ).
Most commonly described as a crisp beer, they’re known for their light, clean taste — although pilsners, a type of lager, are slightly bitterer. They come in three main colors — pale, amber, and dark ( 4 ).
Here’s a list of low calorie lagers along with their alcohol by volume (ABV) percentage.
Budweiser Select  (2.4% ABV): 55 calories
Molson Ultra  (3% ABV): 70 calories
Moosehead Cracked Canoe  (3.5% ABV): 90 calories
Sleeman Light  (4% ABV): 90 calories
Busch Light  (4.1% ABV): 91 calories
Labatt Premier  (4% ABV): 92 calories
Amstel Light  (4% ABV): 95 calories
Anheuser-Busch Natural Light  (4.2% ABV): 95 calories
Miller Light  (4.2% ABV): 96 calories
Heineken Light  (4.2% ABV): 97 calories
Bud Select  (2.4% ABV): 99 calories
Corona Light  (3.7% ABV): 99 calories

Labatt Blue Light  (4% ABV): 108 calories
Brava Light  (4% ABV): 112 calories
Moosehead Light  (4% ABV): 115 calories
Samuel Adams  (4.3% ABV): 124 calories

21–35. Ales
Many people confuse lagers and ales due to their similar appearance.
However, ales are typically produced in northern, colder countries, such as Canada, Germany, and Belgium — and are commonly made by microbreweries. They’re brewed at higher temperatures and fermented using a different yeast strain ( 4 ).
Unlike lagers, ales tend to have a fruity taste and stronger, bitterer flavor. India pale ale (IPA) and saison are among the most popular varieties.
Here are some popular low calorie ales.
Le Petit Prince  (2.9% ABV): 75 calories
Dogfish Head Slighty Mighty  (4% ABV): 95 calories
Lagunitas DayTime  (4% ABV): 98 calories
Boulevard Brewing Easy Sport  (4.1% ABV) 99 calories
Lakefront Eazy Teazy  (3.4% ABV): 99 calories
Kona Kanaha Blonde Ale  (4.2% ABV): 99 calories
Southern Tier Swipe Light  (4% ABV): 110 calories
Mural Agua Fresca Cerveza  (4% ABV): 110 calories
Harpoon Rec League  (3.8% ABV): 120 calories
Boston Beer 26.2 Brew  (4% ABV): 120 calories
Firestone Walker Easy Jack  (4% ABV): 120 calories
River Trip Pale Ale  (4.8% ABV): 128 calories
Oarsman Ale  (4% ABV): 137 calories
Southern Tier 8 Days a Week Blonde Ale  (4.8% ABV): 144 calories
Fat Tire Amber Ale  (5.2% ABV): 160 calories

36–41. Stouts
Stouts are a type of ale that use  roasted barley  to create a rich, dark color ( 5 ).
While they’re known for being higher in calories, the roasting process generally affects the color of the beer rather than the calorie count. As such, you can enjoy a number of low calorie stouts ( 5 ).
Here are some great low-calorie stouts you can try.
Guinness Extra  (5.6% ABV): 126 calories
Odell Brewing Cutthroat  (5% ABV): 145 calories
Young’s Double Chocolate Stout  (5.2% ABV): 150 calories
Taddy Porter  (5% ABV): 186 calories
Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout  (5% ABV): 190 calories
Murphy’s Irish Stout  (4% ABV): 192 calories

42–45. Gluten-free beers
Since most beer is made from barley and wheat, it’s generally unsuitable for those following a gluten-free diet. However,  gluten-free beer  — made from grains like millet, sorghum, and rice — has recently surged in popularity ( 6 ).
This type of beer cannot be made with gluten-containing grains and must be under a gluten level of 20 ppm ( 6 ).
Alternatively, gluten-removed or -reduced beers use enzymes to break down gluten into smaller particles.
These beers may pose a lower risk to those with non-celiac  gluten sensitivity  or gluten intolerance but are still inappropriate for those with celiac disease or a gluten allergy ( 7 ,  8 ,  9 ).
These gluten-free beers are low in calories but excel in flavor.
Glutenberg Blonde  (4.5% ABV): 160 calories
Green’s IPA  (6% ABV): 160 calories
Holidaily Favorite Blonde  (5% ABV): 161 calories
Coors Peak  (4.7% ABV): 170 calories

46–50. Non-alcoholic beer
Non-alcoholic beer  can be great for those who avoid or limit alcohol but still want to enjoy a cold beverage.
Because alcohol packs 7 calories per gram, non-alcoholic beer is usually much lower in calories than traditional brews ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
Yet, in the United States, non-alcoholic beers can contain up to 0.5% alcohol. As such, they’re unsuitable if you’re pregnant or recovering from alcoholism ( 10 ).
With the rise of non-alcoholic beers, many companies have created delicious, low calorie options.
Coors Edge  (0.5% ABV): 45 calories
Becks Non-Alcoholic Beer  (0.0% ABV): 60 calories
Heineken 0.0  (0.0% ABV): 69 calories
Bavaria 0.0% Beer  (0.0% ABV): 85 calories
Budweiser Prohibition Brew  (0.0% ABV): 150 calories

A word of caution
Low calorie beer is not synonymous with low alcohol beer.
Excessive alcohol intake  is associated with an increased risk of liver disease, heart disease, early death, and certain types of cancer, including breast and colon cancer ( 11 ,  12 ).
Moreover, excess beer drinking may lead to  unwanted hangover symptoms , such as headaches, nausea, dizziness, and dehydration ( 13 ).
If you’re of legal drinking age, limit your intake to no more than 1 drink per day for women or 2 drinks per day for men ( 14 ).
Finally, avoid alcohol completely if you’re pregnant, as it can significantly increase the risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders ( 15 ).

The bottom line
If you watch your calorie intake, you don’t have to give up beer. From lagers to stouts, there are delicious, low calorie options to suit any preference.
Keep in mind that low calorie beers may still be high in  alcohol , so it’s best to stick to 1–2 drinks per day.
