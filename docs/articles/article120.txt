The options when it comes to vitamin brands can be overwhelming, to say the least. Vitamin subscription services take the guesswork out of vitamin purchases by offering more personalized suggestions — and even custom blends — based on questionnaires or blood testing.
These companies also automatically ship monthly refills so you never run out. Some even package your daily vitamins in individual envelopes, making grabbing your day’s supply easy without opening multiple vitamin bottles.
Healthline’s dietitians looked at 12 of the most popular personalized vitamin services on the market and tried the products themselves. These five services ultimately passed our dietitians’ review and our internal vetting process.

“I tested HUM Private Party [probiotic] for about a month. I took the pill once a day with water, not with food, as directed.  The capsule was small and easy to swallow, and I had no side effects.
“I’ve tried a few products from HUM Nutrition. They have been great with shipping. I like that they are non-GMO certified, part of the  Clean Label Project , and devoted to avoiding putting more plastic in our oceans.”

Best prenatal

Personalization   products formulated for various reproductive stages
Certifications   third-party tested for purity and potency
Why we chose it:  Founded by an OB-GYN alongside a team of experts in women’s health, Perelel is unique in that its  prenatal blends  are formulated for each trimester.
During testing, we liked the convenience of the daily packs. Not only are they handy for traveling, but they also come in handy on days when you’re dealing with serious  pregnancy brain .
How it works:  Perelel is a supplement company that offers convenient daily supplement packs formulated to provide nutritional support for various stages of the reproductive cycle.

Perelel offers a 3-second survey on its website to help you find the right product for you. Shipping is free for subscriptions over $34 and one-time purchases over $58.50. Otherwise, there’s a $7 shipping fee.
“Because I struggle with remembering to take all of my vitamins when pregnant, I was excited to try Perelel’s daily packs. While I’ve only been taking them for a few months, so far I’ve been very impressed.
“Not only are the daily packs convenient, but I also like that I don’t have to remember to reorder my supplements each month.
“As an added bonus, I’ve found all of the pills to be easy to swallow and haven’t experienced any negative side effects, like fishy burps. The only downside is the omega-3 supplement doesn’t taste great if you let it sit on your tongue for a second too long, so I recommend swallowing it quickly.”
— Kelli McGrane, MS, RD

Know that a personalized vitamin service isn’t always appropriate, and most people do not need to take multiple supplements, especially if you eat a well-rounded diet.
Unless you have a need you’ve discussed with your dietitian or other trusted healthcare professional, you might consider something more straightforward.  Ritual  is one brand that does a solid job of curating bioavailable ingredients by age and sex.  Thorne  is a well-tested brand that makes a variety of supplements with high quality ingredients.

A comparison of the best personalized supplement subscription services
Here’s a quick look at how our top picks compare:
3rd  = Third-party tested,  RD  = Access to registered dieticians

How we chose these vitamin subscription services
We determined the best personalized vitamins and vitamin subscription services using the following criteria:
Quality:  Are the supplements made from high quality ingredients and free of  artificial additives  such as colors and preservatives? Are the products third-party tested, or do they undergo testing at multiple manufacturing stages?
Selection:  Does the service offer many products to meet most people’s needs?
Individualization:  Does the company provide recommendations based on a health assessment or test and allow you to add or remove products as you see fit?
Helpfulness:  Does the service provide evidence-based information about the supplements it recommends or access to health professionals, such as doctors or registered dietitians (RDs), for paying members?
Compliance with FDA guidelines:  The brands on our list adhere to allowable health claims and labeling requirements per FDA regulations. They also manufacture products in facilities that adhere to the current CGMPs established by the FDA.
Hands-on testing:  Healthline editors and writers tested several services to see whether each was seamless from signup to delivery. We also paid attention to how easy the supplements were to take and whether there were any side effects.
Vetting:  The brands on our list have been vetted to ensure that they align with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being. You can read more about  our vetting process .
Most of the services below require you to sign up for recurring monthly shipments, and each product typically contains 30 servings.
Therefore, the monthly cost of a service depends on the product(s) you select and the total number of products you choose to receive each month.
Unlike many other subscription services, vitamin subscriptions generally do not charge separate membership or subscription fees.

How to choose the best vitamin subscription service
When choosing a vitamin subscription service, there are several factors to consider, such as the type of personalization offered, access to health professionals, cost, and brand reputation.
If you’d rather pick and choose the supplements you want, a service such as  HUM  may work best.
However, if you want recommendations based on your health needs, choose a service such as  Gainful  that uses a personalized vitamins quiz or blood testing.
If you want personalization plus the added bonus of individual daily packets, then a service such as  Perelel  offers both.
Several companies, including  HUM  and  Persona , offer access to health professionals, such as  dietitians , for questions and supplement guidance.
Vitamin subscription services can cost $25 to $100 or more monthly.
Finally, ensure that your vitamin subscription service is reputable and transparent. This means the company’s products are manufactured in facilities that adhere to the CGMPs.
Because the FDA doesn’t regulate dietary supplements the same way it does pharmaceuticals, it’s also a good idea to choose third-party tested supplements to verify that the contents of the bottle match what is listed on the label.

Are personalized vitamin services worth it?
Whether a personalized vitamin service is worth it depends on the service and whether you value its convenience.
These services can be particularly beneficial for people who are unsure which supplements to take and who regularly forget to reorder them.
Some services offer additional features, such as access to a dietitian, that may make them worth a slightly higher cost.
Research from 2024  looked at personalized nutrition approaches. It suggests that personalized nutrition advice based on current lifestyle, biological characteristics, and more, may be superior to generalized or standardized nutrition advice in helping improve diet quality and metabolic health. However, more research is needed.
Plus, these services are typically more expensive than buying supplements from a local or online pharmacy.
Additionally, the health quizzes that many personalized vitamin companies use are not a substitute for a thorough medical review by a healthcare professional. Personalized vitamin quizzes may recommend more supplements than you need.
Before clicking the subscribe button, it’s best to share your supplement recommendations with a trusted healthcare professional, such as a doctor or dietitian.
All of the subscription services above offer personalized vitamins and customized supplement recommendations based on the results of a health screening or questionnaire.
However, companies may not disclose these products’ exact ingredients or amounts. So, you should be especially careful when choosing reputable companies to buy personalized vitamins.
The brands above are all very transparent about their supplements and ingredients. While they may offer individualized recommendations and personal vitamin packs, their supplements disclose ingredients and vital information.

Personalized supplements provide the same vitamins and minerals as regular supplements and are generally safe for most healthy adults when used as directed.
However, mixing medications and dietary supplements  can be dangerous  because it can affect how your body absorbs and metabolizes medication, so it’s best to check in with your doctor first if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medications.
And, whenever possible, it’s best to opt for products that have been through third-party testing, which can help ensure safety and quality.
