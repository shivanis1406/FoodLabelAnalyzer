Your body depends on iron for vital processes, such as oxygen transportation, hormone production, growth, and neurological development.
Most people can get all the iron they need by eating a nutrient-dense, well-rounded diet. But if you have inadequate iron intake, increased need, or impaired absorption, you may be at risk of low iron levels and iron deficiency anemia.
If a healthcare professional recommends supplemental iron, you might consider the following options vetted by Healthline’s medical and nutrition experts.
$  = under $0.20 per serving
$$  = $0.20 to $0.40 per serving
$$$  = over $0.40 per serving

Why we chose it:  This iron-only supplement is an excellent choice for treating low iron stores, made by one of the most reputable supplement brands.

Each capsule packs 139% of the Daily Value (DV) for iron in the form of  ferrous bisglycinate chelate  — a type of iron that’s easy for your body to absorb and less likely to cause GI side effects than other forms of iron, such as  ferrous sulfate .

Best multivitamin with iron
Form   capsule
Dose   2 capsules per day
Certifications   USP verified, non-GMO verified, Made Traceable
Price   $$$

Why we chose it:  This multivitamin contains iron alongside other important nutrients, and is designed for people looking to fill gaps in their diets.

The mint-scented capsules contain iron bisglycinate, which may be  easier to absorb  and cause less GI distress than other types of iron.

Ritual Essential for Women Multivitamin 18+ also includes several nutrients that you may have difficulty getting enough of from food alone, such as:

vitamin D
docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA )
folate

Unlike many other multivitamins, it doesn’t contain calcium, which can  interfere  with iron absorption.

But it lacks several nutrients that people following a  vegan diet might not get enough of , including iodine and zinc. It’s also low in magnesium and doesn’t contain vitamin C or many B vitamins other than folate and B12.

Best affordable iron supplement
Form   tablet
Dose   1 tablet per day
Certifications   USP verified
Price   $

Why we chose it:  This is the lowest cost option on our list, providing a high iron content at a low price.
Nature Made boasts 65 mg of iron per capsule — that’s 361% of the DV for iron, or the equivalent of 325 mg of ferrous sulfate.

Ferrous sulfate is a  common form  of supplemental iron with high solubility, meaning that it releases iron ions faster and is therefore easier to absorb.

However, this form of iron is  more likely  than other forms to cause GI side effects, such as constipation.

The product is verified by  United States Pharmacopeia (USP) , a third-party organization that tests for aspects of quality such as:
purity
potency
performance
“I have a history of iron-deficiency anemia and took this product for about 10 years or so.
“While I ultimately switched to a vegan-friendly brand, I did like this product because it didn’t cause me any GI issues, the pills were small and easy to swallow, and it didn’t have any taste or smell. I also liked that it was USP verified.
Another pro is that Nature Made products are affordable and easy to find in stores. It was convenient for me to be able to pick this up at the grocery store or at Target when out running errands.”

Best chewable iron
Form   chewable tablet
Dose   1 tablet per day
Certifications   non-GMO

Why we chose it:  These chewable tablets have a sweet cherry flavor but are lower in added sugar than other edible iron supplements.

Best iron supplement for kids
Form   liquid
Dose   30 drops (1 mL)
Certifications   USDA organic
Price   $$

Why we chose it:  This liquid supplement has a sweet grape flavor to appeal to kids, and a lower iron content than adult iron supplements.
Some kids aren’t able to meet their iron needs through diet alone. Inadequate iron intake is the  most common cause  of low iron levels in kids, but health conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and celiac disease can lead to iron deficiency, too.
If your child does need extra iron in their diet, it’s important to choose a children’s iron supplement. These contain lower doses of iron than adult supplements.
Mary Ruth’s Organic Toddler Iron Liquid Drops contain 3.5 mg of iron from ferrous bisglycinate chelate, which covers 50% of the DV for 1- to 3-year-olds. You can also increase the dose for older children, making it a convenient choice for parents who have more than one child with increased iron needs.
Ferrous bisglycinate chelate is a good choice for kids, as it’s  less likely  to cause digestive side effects, like constipation, compared with other forms of iron, like ferrous sulfate.
This liquid product is designed to be easy for kids to swallow with its sweet grape flavor. However, it’s important to check with your child’s pediatrician before giving them an iron supplement. Kids are much  more susceptible  to iron toxicity than adults, and giving them unnecessary supplemental iron can be dangerous.
Mary Ruth’s Organic Toddler Iron Liquid Drops is certified organic and Clean Label Project-certified. Clean Label Project-certified products are third-party tested for  over 200 contaminants and toxins , including pesticides and heavy metals like mercury, so you can rest assured you’re giving your child a safe supplement.
This product is also free from gluten, tree nuts, and dairy, making it a good choice for kids with  food allergies .

Iron type:  The supplements contain easily absorbed forms of iron.
Other nutrients:  The supplements are free of nutrients that impair iron absorption and may contain nutrients that enhance absorption.
Dose:  The supplements contain an effective  dose of iron .
Price:  We included products to suit a variety of budgets.
Forms:  We included iron supplements in several forms, including liquids and chewables, to suit different preferences and tolerances.
Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the brands on this page, we considered all the vitamin brands that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further.

Iron: What you need to know
Iron is an essential mineral present in:
Hemoglobin:  This protein transports oxygen from your lungs to your tissues.
Myoglobin:  This is another protein that carries and stores oxygen for your muscles.
Iron is also  essential  for:
brain cell development
physical growth
hormone synthesis
muscle metabolism
To support these important processes, your body needs a steady supply of iron from your diet.
Iron exists in  two forms  in nature:
Heme iron:  This iron is found in animal-derived foods. The human body readily absorbs it.
Non-heme iron:  This form is found in plant-based and iron-fortified foods. The body doesn’t absorb it as well as it does heme iron.
You can also take iron supplements. Iron supplements may be necessary for people who don’t get enough iron in their diet and those with increased iron needs.
For people who  need an iron supplement , choosing the right one can feel overwhelming. There are so many options, not to mention different forms and doses.
Supplemental iron comes in different forms, including:
ferrous sulfate
ferrous fumarate
ferrous bisglycinate
ferrous gluconate
While all these forms can effectively raise iron levels, some are a bit harder on your digestive system.
For example, ferrous sulfate is one of the most common forms of iron. But it’s  more likely  to cause gastrointestinal side effects like nausea and constipation.
Meanwhile, ferrous bisglycinate is  highly absorbable  and unlikely to cause side effects. Ferrous bisgycinate chelate is often considered one of the best-tolerated iron supplements.
Additionally, iron supplements come in various doses, which can increase the risk of side effects.
Taking  higher doses  of iron — 45 mg or more per day — is more likely to cause gastrointestinal side effects than lower doses.
Here’s a more in-depth overview of the types of iron you might find in popular supplements, including their bioavailability, affordability, and  side effects :
People with adequate iron stores should aim to meet their iron needs through foods rather than supplements. However, you might need an iron supplement if you:
are treating an existing  iron deficiency
have low iron stores
are trying to maintain healthy iron levels
People at risk of developing an iron deficiency who may benefit from an iron supplement include:
infants and kids
pregnant people
people with heavy menstrual bleeding
people with certain forms of cancer, such as colon cancer
people with gastrointestinal disorders, such as celiac disease and  Crohn’s disease
people with heart failure
people who frequently donate blood
athletes
Health experts do not recommend giving an iron supplement to your child unless a healthcare professional directs you to do so. Children are  more susceptible  to iron toxicity than adults.
Some people with iron deficiency anemia may need  iron infusions  if:
oral iron supplementation does not work
their bodies can’t properly absorb iron
their iron losses are too great to be treated with oral supplements
Overall, it’s wise to talk with a healthcare professional to find out whether an iron supplement is right for you.
The typical treatment for iron deficiency anemia is taking  daily oral iron supplements  for at least  3 months  to replenish iron stores.
Healthcare professionals may recommend some people continue to take iron supplements even after their hemoglobin levels return to normal.
For these people, taking an iron-only supplement is a good idea because other nutrients commonly found in multivitamins, such as calcium, may inhibit  iron absorption .
Additionally, experts recommend taking iron supplements between meals and avoiding pairing them with foods or beverages that may  inhibit  iron absorption, such as:
tea
coffee
milk
Instead, take iron with a source of vitamin C, such as orange juice or bell peppers. Vitamin C can help enhance iron absorption.
In terms of supplement forms, one of the best iron supplements for anemia that’s unlikely to cause constipation is ferrous bisglycinate chelate. It’s  highly absorbable  and gentle on the digestive system, making it a smart choice for those with sensitive stomachs.

Potential side effects and safety concerns
Certain iron supplements are more likely to cause side effects than others.
Potential side effects of taking iron supplements  include :
constipation
diarrhea
nausea
abdominal pain
Iron can be toxic  if taken in very high doses. To reduce the risk of side effects and toxicity, avoid exceeding the established  tolerable upper intake levels for iron  supplements unless a healthcare professional recommends it.
These levels are as follows:
40 mg per day for babies and kids
45 mg per day for teens and adults
Finally, it’s important to keep iron supplements out of reach of children because they are more susceptible to iron toxicity than adults.
Children may mistake iron supplements for candy and ingest large amounts, which  can be fatal .
Iron supplements  may reduce  the absorption of medications used to treat Parkinson’s disease.
Iron supplements may lower the effectiveness of  levothyroxine , a common drug used to treat:
hypothyroidism, also called an underactive thyroid
goiter
thyroid cancer
On the other hand, some medications — such as  proton pump inhibitors , which treat acid reflux or stomach ulcers — can  reduce  iron absorption because they lower gastric acid secretion, which plays a key role in iron uptake.
Having too little iron in your body can cause symptoms  such as :
fatigue
weakness
difficulty concentrating
shortness of breath
Some people are more at risk of developing iron deficiency anemia, including:
people with heavy periods
pregnant people
people with health conditions that cause nutrient malabsorption
If you think you may have an iron deficiency, visit a healthcare professional. They can check your iron levels with a blood test.
Do not try to treat an iron deficiency on your own. Even though most people respond well to oral iron supplements, some may need iron infusions to effectively increase their iron levels.

How to choose an iron supplement
It’s important to consider several factors when choosing an iron supplement, including the type of iron, provided dose, and product quality and safety.
Here are the current  Recommended Dietary Allowances  for iron in healthy teens and adults:
For kids and babies, the  Recommended Dietary Allowances  are:
Keep in mind that if you’re low on iron, you’ll need more iron than most other people need each day.
If you have low iron stores, have a deficiency, or need extra iron for any reason, a healthcare professional can recommend a dosage that fits your needs.

Frequently asked questions about iron supplements

Many forms of supplemental iron are  effective  for increasing iron levels.

Ferrous forms of iron tend to be more bioavailable than ferric iron, meaning your body more easily absorbs them.

However, some forms of iron, including ferrous sulfate, are more likely to cause gastrointestinal side effects like constipation than other forms, such as iron bisglycinate chelate.

So, iron bisglycinate chelate is a good overall option for raising iron levels that’s also gentle on the stomach.

Meanwhile, iron supplements come in several options, including liquids, capsules, and chewable products. Liquid and chewable iron supplements are a good choice if you cannot tolerate pills or capsules.

Some people, such as those with health conditions that cause nutrient malabsorption, may  require  iron infusions. These are administered and monitored by a healthcare team.

The amount of iron you should take depends on your iron levels.

For people with iron deficiency, the typical  recommendation  is to take divided daily doses to reach 100 mg to 200 mg of elemental iron per day.

However,  research  suggests that taking smaller doses of iron once daily and taking iron every other day may help improve absorption and tolerability compared with taking large daily doses of iron.

Iron is best absorbed on an empty stomach, so it’s  recommended to take iron  first thing in the morning, apart from meals and beverages like coffee or milk. However, some research shows that consuming iron supplements with a vitamin C-rich beverage, like orange juice, can  significantly increase  iron absorption.
While it’s best to take iron on an empty stomach, if iron supplements make you feel queasy, it’s OK to take them with a small meal or snack.

The bottom line
Iron is an important mineral that’s  necessary  for oxygen transport and the formation of healthy red blood cells.
While it’s always best to fulfill your iron needs through a diet high in iron-rich whole foods, supplements may sometimes be necessary to help you reach your daily iron needs.
Many types of iron supplements are available and contain varying doses and forms of the mineral.
Consult a healthcare professional before taking any new supplement, and consider the factors mentioned above to help you choose a high quality product.
