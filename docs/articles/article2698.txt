Marjoram is a unique herb popular in many Mediterranean dishes.

This article tells you everything you need to know about marjoram.

What is marjoram?
Marjoram, also known as sweet marjoram, is an aromatic herb in the mint family that has been grown in the Mediterranean, North Africa, and Western Asia for thousands of years ( 1 ).
While similar to  oregano , it has a milder flavor and is often used to garnish salads, soups, and meat dishes.
It’s particularly potent when dried but can also be used fresh.
What’s more, marjoram has been shown to have several anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. It has been used medicinally to help treat a variety of ailments, including digestive issues, infections, and painful menstruation ( 1 ).
Fresh or dried leaves can be made into a  tea  or  extract . Both forms can be found in health food stores or online.
It’s important to note that marjoram extracts vary in strength and purity based on the manufacturer and source. To make sure you’re getting a high-quality product, look for third-party certification on the label.

Potential benefits
Research suggests that marjoram may have several health benefits.
Antioxidants help prevent cell damage caused by potentially harmful molecules called free radicals.
Several compounds in marjoram, such as carvacrol, have been shown to have  antioxidant effects  ( 1 ,  2 ).
In particular, they may help  reduce inflammation  in your body ( 2 ,  3 ).
While inflammation is a normal bodily response, chronic inflammation can increase your risk of certain diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and autoimmune disorders. Thus, reducing inflammation may lower your risk ( 4 ,  5 ).
Marjoram has also demonstrated antimicrobial properties.
Common uses include applying its diluted  essential oil  to your skin to treat fungal infections, as well as taking supplements to help treat overgrowth of gut bacteria ( 6 ,  7 ,  8 ).
However, more research is needed on these particular uses.
What’s more, this herb is utilized as a natural  pesticide  for various food crops ( 9 ).
Marjoram has historically been used to prevent digestive issues like stomach ulcers and certain  foodborne illnesses  ( 10 ,  11 ).
A study of six herbs revealed that marjoram fought against  Clostridium perfringens , a common foodborne pathogen ( 11 ).
In addition, a rat study noted that its extract protected against  stomach ulcers  ( 10 ).
Still, human studies are needed.
Marjoram has been shown to stimulate menstrual flow.
Its extract or tea may help regulate your menstrual cycle, as well as  restore hormone balance  in non-pregnant women with an irregular cycle ( 12 ).
It may also help treat  polycystic ovary syndrome  (PCOS), a hormonal disorder with symptoms like irregular periods and acne. A study in 25 women with PCOS found that marjoram tea improved their hormonal profiles and insulin sensitivity ( 13 ).
To avoid risks, check with your healthcare provider before taking any herbal supplements to aid menstruation.
Marjoram is linked to several benefits, such as reduced inflammation, improved digestive health, and menstrual regulation.

Possible side effects
Marjoram may have several side effects.
As such, you should use caution when supplementing.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women  should avoid marjoram supplements.
Due to its influence on various reproductive hormones and menstruation, this herb may trigger negative side effects during pregnancy ( 14 ).
Marjoram supplements may inhibit blood clotting ( 15 ).
One study analyzing 20 herbs determined that marjoram impeded platelet formation, which is a key factor in blood clotting ( 15 ,  16 ).
This may be especially concerning for anyone taking blood thinners.
Marjoram may interact with certain medications, such as blood thinners and anticoagulants, to increase your risk of bleeding ( 12 ).
It may also interact with some diabetes medications by lowering blood sugar, potentially resulting in dangerously low levels. If you have diabetes, consult your healthcare practitioner before taking marjoram ( 17 ,  18 )
While generally regarded as safe, marjoram can cause side effects and should be avoided by pregnant or breastfeeding women. Those on certain medications may want to consult their medical provider before taking it.

How to add marjoram to your diet
This herb is usually used in small quantities as a garnish or spice. Thus, you may have to drink its tea or take it in supplement form to experience its benefits.
Marjoram can also be incorporated into  cooking oils  by mixing 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of your favorite oil with 1 teaspoon (1 gram) of marjoram. You can use this mixture for everyday cooking or to marinate vegetables and meats.
When making soups or stews, try wrapping 2–3 tablespoons (6–9 grams) of marjoram in a small piece of cheesecloth and soaking it in your pot while cooking.
If you don’t have any marjoram on hand, you can substitute several other herbs.
Oregano works particularly well, though it’s stronger than marjoram — so you may want to use a little less.
Thyme  and  sage  — while slightly different in flavor — can also serve as viable replacements. Use a 1:1 ratio for these herbs.
While marjoram is traditionally used in small quantities in cooking, you can also drink its tea or take supplements to experience its benefits.

The bottom line
Marjoram is an aromatic  herb  long used in cooking and traditional medicine.
It has several potential benefits, including reducing inflammation, relieving digestive issues, and regulating the  menstrual cycle .
Use caution if taking it in supplement form and consult your healthcare practitioner if you have certain medical conditions.
