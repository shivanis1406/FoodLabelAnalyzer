Title: Is Quinoa Gluten-Free? The Surprising Truth

Following a gluten-free diet can be challenging, often requiring effort to find healthy alternatives to whole-wheat products.
Quinoa is a popular pseudocereal enjoyed for its delicious flavor, impressive nutrient profile, and versatility in cooking.
However, despite its many nutritional benefits, some people are unsure whether quinoa is gluten-free.
This article tells you whether quinoa contains gluten and can be safely enjoyed as part of a gluten-free diet.

What Is Gluten?
Gluten is a type of protein found in certain grains, such as rye, wheat, and barley.
For most people, digesting gluten is not an issue.
Yet, for those who are  sensitive to gluten , eating foods that contain this protein can cause symptoms like bloating, gas, and fatigue ( 1 ).
Additionally, eating gluten can trigger an immune response in people with celiac disease, causing their immune system to attack healthy cells in their body ( 2 ).
This can lead to serious side effects, such as unintentional weight loss, diarrhea, and  nutritional deficiencies  ( 3 ).
For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, selecting gluten-free substitutes for wheat, barley, and rye can minimize symptoms and help maintain overall health.
Gluten is a type of protein found in certain grains, such as rye, wheat, and barley. Though eating it is not an issue for most people, it can cause adverse effects in people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.

Gluten-Free Pseudocereal
Quinoa is naturally gluten-free, making it a great alternative to other grains as part of a healthy,  gluten-free diet  ( 4 ).
In fact, one six-week study in 19 people with celiac disease showed that eating about 1.8 ounces (50 grams) of quinoa per day was well tolerated and resulted in minimal side effects ( 5 ).
In addition to being safe and well tolerated, quinoa is also highly nutritious, making it an excellent addition to a gluten-free diet.
In fact, one study found that incorporating quinoa and other grain-based products into a gluten-free diet significantly increased the diet’s overall nutrient profile ( 6 ).
Quinoa is naturally gluten-free and generally well tolerated by those with celiac disease. It can also help improve the nutrient profile of a healthy gluten-free diet.

May Cause Issues for Some People
Though quinoa is naturally gluten-free, it contains certain compounds that may be problematic for some people with  celiac disease .
Quinoa contains prolamins, which are types of proteins found in many cereal grains.
Gluten, in particular, is made up of two specific types of wheat prolamins — gliadin and glutenin — which can trigger symptoms in those with a sensitivity ( 7 ).
One test-tube study analyzed several varieties of quinoa and found that some types triggered an immune response in tissue samples from people with celiac disease ( 8 ).
However, despite these findings, another study showed that eating 1.8 ounces (50 grams) of quinoa per day was safe and well tolerated by those with the condition, making it a  good alternative  to other gluten-containing grains ( 5 ).
Therefore, it may be best to increase your intake of quinoa gradually to make sure you tolerate it without any adverse effects.
Quinoa may also be processed in facilities that also produce gluten-containing ingredients, which could increase the risk of cross-contamination.
If you have celiac disease or a sensitivity to gluten, be sure to select a brand that is certified gluten-free to reduce this risk.
Quinoa contains prolamins, which could potentially cause issues for some people with celiac disease. Yet, other research shows that this pseudocereal is safe and well tolerated by those with the condition.

Highly Nutritious and Beneficial
In addition to being gluten-free, quinoa is incredibly nutritious and may be linked to a number of  powerful health benefits .
For starters, it’s one of the few plant foods considered a complete source of protein — meaning it supplies all eight essential amino acids that your body needs ( 9 ).
It’s also rich in antioxidants — such as quercetin and kaempferol — which are compounds that can help prevent oxidative damage to your cells and protect against chronic disease ( 10 ,  11 ).
Thanks to its high fiber content, it may also help promote digestive health, manage blood sugar levels, and  support weight loss  ( 12 ,  13 ,  14 ).
Additionally, it’s very nutrient-dense, with a 1-cup (185-gram) serving of cooked quinoa providing a good amount of several key vitamins and minerals, such as manganese, magnesium, and phosphorus ( 15 ).
Quinoa is high in several important vitamins and minerals, as well as protein, fiber, and antioxidants.

Versatile and Easy to Enjoy
Quinoa has a sweet and nutty flavor that works well in a variety of dishes.
It’s also easy to prepare, making it a simple substitute to other gluten-containing grains.
To get started, simply combine two parts water or broth with one part quinoa in a pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 15–20 minutes until all liquid has been absorbed.
Quinoa can be combined with other ingredients, such as meat or veggies to whip up gluten-free casseroles, crusts, salads, and skillets.
Meanwhile, quinoa flour can be  swapped in for regular flour  and used to prepare pancakes, cookies, quick bread, and brownies.
Quinoa is easy to prepare and can be used in a wide variety of recipes. What’s more quinoa flour is a great gluten-free alternative for regular flour.

The Bottom Line
Quinoa is naturally gluten-free and generally well tolerated by those with gluten sensitivity.
Yet, it may contain prolamins — proteins found in many cereal grains that cause problems for some people with celiac disease.
Plus, some products may be cross-contaminated, so be sure to buy certified gluten-free.
If you have celiac disease, it may be best to gradually increase your intake of quinoa to see if you can tolerate it without adverse effects.
For most people, quinoa is a versatile, delicious, and easy-to-prepare addition to a  healthy diet  — gluten-free or not.
