Title: Vitex Agnus-Castus: Which Benefits of Chasteberry Are Backed by Science?

Researchers have found that  Vitex agnus-castus , or chasteberry, may enhance fertility, reduce symptoms of premenstrual syndrome and menopause, and repel certain insects, like mosquitos.
Vitex agnus-castus  is a popular herbal supplement used to treat a variety of health problems.
It’s most commonly used to treat:
premenstrual syndrome (PMS)
menstrual disorders
infertility
acne
menopause
nursing difficulties
It’s also touted as protection against insect bites and certain types of cancer and claimed to offer a variety of other health effects. However, not all benefits are backed by science.
Here are the science-backed benefits — as well as some myths — associated with  Vitex agnus-castus .

What is Vitex Agnus-Castus?
Vitex , which is the name of the largest genus in the  Verbenaceae  plant family, includes 250 species worldwide ( 1 ).
Vitex agnus-castus  is the most common vitex used medicinally.
The  Vitex agnus-castus  fruit, also known as chasteberry or monk’s pepper, is about the size of a peppercorn. It’s produced by the chaste tree, which acquired its name because its fruit was likely used to decrease men’s libido during the Middle Ages ( 2 ).
This fruit — as well as other parts of the plant — are typically used as an herbal remedy to treat a variety of ailments.
For instance,  Vitex agnus-castus  is used to treat:
PMS
symptoms of menopause
infertility issues
other conditions affecting a woman’s reproductive system
In fact, it’s been used in this way since ancient Greece ( 2 ).
In Turkish medicine, it’s also used as a digestive, antifungal and  anti-anxiety aid  ( 3 ).
Vitex agnus-castus  is a plant frequently harvested as an herbal remedy for a variety of ailments. Its most popular use is to relieve PMS, menopause symptoms and infertility issues.

Improves conditions affecting women’s reproductive systems
Vitex agnus-castus  is particularly known for its ability to improve conditions affecting a woman’s reproductive system.
One of  the  most popular and well-researched attributes of  Vitex agnus-castus  is its ability to reduce symptoms of PMS.
These include:
constipation
irritability
depressed mood
migraines
breast pain and tenderness
Researchers believe that vitex works by decreasing levels of the hormone prolactin. This helps rebalance other hormones, including estrogen and progesterone — thus reducing PMS symptoms ( 4 ).
In one study, women with PMS took  Vitex agnus-castus  during three consecutive menstrual cycles. In total, 93 percent of those given vitex reported a decrease in PMS symptoms, including:
depression
anxiety
cravings
However, the study didn’t include a control group, and placebo effects can’t be ruled out ( 5 ).
In two smaller studies, women with PMS were given 20 mg of  Vitex agnus-castus  per day or a placebo for three menstrual cycles.
Twice as many women in the vitex group reported a decrease in symptoms including irritability, mood swings, headaches and breast fullness, compared to those given the placebo ( 6 ,  7 ).
Vitex agnus-castus  also appears to help reduce cyclic mastalgia, a type of breast pain linked to menstruation. Research suggests that it may be as effective as common drug treatment — but with far fewer side effects ( 8 ,  9 ,  10 ).
However, two recent reviews report that although vitex appears helpful in reducing PMS symptoms, its benefits may be overestimated ( 11 ,  12 ,  13 ).
Better-designed studies may be needed before strong conclusions can be made.
The  hormone-balancing effects of  Vitex agnus-castus  may also help relieve symptoms of menopause.
In one study, vitex oils were given to 23 women in menopause. Women reported improved menopause symptoms, including better mood and  sleep . Some even regained their period ( 14 ).
In a follow-up study 52 additional pre- and postmenopausal women were given a vitex cream. Of the study participants, 33 percent experienced major improvements, and another 36 percent reported moderate improvements in symptoms, including night sweats and hot flashes ( 14 ).
However, not all studies have observed benefits. One recent and larger double-blind, randomized, controlled trial — the gold standard in research — gave women a placebo or a daily tablet containing a combination of vitex and  St. John’s wort .
After 16 weeks, the vitex supplement was no more effective than the placebo at reducing hot flashes, depression or any other menopausal symptoms ( 15 ).
Keep in mind that in many studies reporting benefits, women were provided with supplements that mixed  Vitex agnus-castus  with other herbs. Therefore, it’s difficult to isolate the effects of vitex alone ( 16 ).
Vitex may improve female fertility due to its possible effect on prolactin levels ( 17 ).
This may be especially true in women with luteal phase defect, or a shortened second half of the menstrual cycle. This disorder is linked to abnormally high prolactin levels and makes it difficult for women to become pregnant.
In one study, 40 women with abnormally high prolactin levels were given either 40 mg of  Vitex agnus-castus  or a pharmaceutical drug. Vitex was as effective as the drug in reducing prolactin levels ( 18 ).
In another study in 52 women with luteal phase defect, 20 mg of vitex resulted in lower prolactin levels and prolonged menstrual phases, while participants given a placebo saw no benefits ( 19 ).
Yet another study gave 93 women — who had unsuccessfully tried to become pregnant over the last 6–36 months — a supplement containing  Vitex agnus-castus  or a placebo.
After three months, women in the vitex group experienced an improved hormone balance — and 26 percent of them became pregnant. In comparison, only 10 percent of those in the placebo group became pregnant ( 20 ).
Keep in mind that the supplement held a mix of other ingredients, making it difficult to isolate the effects of vitex.
Irregular periods can also hamper women in  planning a pregnancy . Three additional studies report that vitex is more effective than a placebo in improving menstrual cycles in women with irregular periods ( 21 ,  22 ,  19 ).
Vitex agnus-castus  may reduce symptoms of PMS and menopause, though study results are mixed. By potentially decreasing prolactin hormone levels and stabilizing menstrual periods, it may also enhance fertility.

Helps prevent insect bites
Vitex may also help keep a variety of insects at bay.
In one study, an extract made from vitex seeds helped repel mosquitoes, flies, ticks, and fleas for about six hours ( 24 ).
Another study revealed that a spray containing vitex and other plant extracts protected against head lice for at least seven hours ( 25 ).
Research further shows that vitex may kill lice larva and impede adult lice reproduction ( 25 ,  26 ).
Vitex agnus-castus  may offer some protection against insects, particularly mosquitoes, flies, ticks, fleas, and head lice.

Other potential benefits
Vitex may also offer a range of additional benefits, including:
Reduced headaches.  In one study, women prone to migraines given vitex daily for three months reduced the number of headaches they experienced during their menstrual cycles by 66 percent ( 28 ). However, the study didn’t include a control group, making it impossible to know whether vitex was responsible for these benefits.
Antibacterial and antifungal effects. Test-tube studies show that  essential oils  made from vitex may fight harmful fungi and bacteria, including  Staphylococcus  and  Salmonella  bacteria ( 29 ,  30 ). Keep in mind that essential oils should not be consumed, and vitex supplements are unlikely to reduce the risk of infections.
Reduced inflammation.  Test-tube and animal studies suggest that compounds in vitex may have  anti-inflammatory properties . However, their effects aren’t stronger than those of aspirin ( 31 ,  32 ).
Bone repair.  In one study, women with bone fractures given a combination of vitex and magnesium had slightly increased markers for bone repair than those given a placebo ( 35 ).
Epilepsy prevention.  Animal studies suggest that vitex may reduce the likelihood of epileptic seizures ( 36 ,  37 ).
That said, research supporting these benefits is limited. More studies are needed before strong conclusions can be drawn.
Vitex may offer multiple other benefits, but the evidence is weak. More research is needed before any claims can be made.

Common myths
Vitex has been traditionally used to treat a wide variety of ailments. However, many of its uses are currently unsupported by scientific evidence.
The most popular unsubstantiated uses include:
Breastfeeding. While an old study postulated that vitex may boost milk supply in nursing women, the overall evidence is weak and controversial ( 38 ).
Pain reduction.  Though research links vitex to numbed pain receptors in rats, no human studies have been done ( 39 ).
Treating endometriosis.  Vitex may normalize hormonal imbalances, which could theoretically reduce symptoms of endometriosis, a female gynecologic disorder. However, no studies confirm this.
Baldness prevention.  The hormone-balancing effects of vitex are sometimes claimed to  boost hair growth  in men. However, no research can be found to support this claim.
Acne treatment.  Three studies assert that vitex may  reduce acne  faster than conventional treatments. However, these studies are decades old. Newer research hasn’t confirmed these effects ( 40 ).
While  Vitex agnus-castus  is used as an alternative remedy to treat various symptoms, many purported benefits are not backed by research.

Potential side effects
Vitex agnus-castus  is typically considered safe.
Researchers report that 30–40 mg of dried fruit extracts, 3–6 grams of dried herb, or 1 gram of dried fruit per day appear safe ( 9 ).
Reported side effects tend to be minor and include ( 41 ):
nausea
upset stomach
mild skin rash
increased acne
headache
heavy menstrual flow
However, pregnant and nursing women should avoid vitex, as its effects on babies haven’t been well-studied ( 42 ).
Researchers also believe that vitex may interact with:
antipsychotic medications
birth control pills
hormone replacement therapy
Therefore, you may want to discuss vitex with your doctor before taking it ( 9 ).
Vitex agnus-castus  has mild and reversible side effects and is considered safe for most people. However, pregnant or nursing women, as well as individuals using certain types of medications, may want to abstain.

The bottom line
Vitex agnus-castus , or chasteberry, may boost fertility and reduce symptoms of PMS and  menopause . It may also repel certain insects.
Most other uses are currently unsupported by science.
It may cause stomach discomfort and other mild side effects, but it’s considered safe for most people.
If you’d like to give  Vitex agnus-castus  a try, it’s best to discuss its use with your doctor first — especially if you’re:
pregnant
nursing
taking certain prescription medications
