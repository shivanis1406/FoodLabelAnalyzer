Title: 10 Promising Benefits and Uses of Apple Pectin

Pectin, a type of fiber in the cell walls of plants, helps give plants their structure ( 1 ).
Apple pectin is extracted from apples, which are some of the richest sources of fiber. Roughly 15–20% of the pulp of this fruit is made of pectin.
Pectin is also found in the peels of citrus fruits, as well as quinces, cherries, plums, and other fruits and vegetables ( 1 ,  2 ).
Apple pectin is linked to several emerging health benefits, including lower cholesterol and improved blood sugar control ( 3 ,  4 ).
Here are 10 promising benefits and uses of apple pectin.

1. May promote gut health
Your gut microbiome needs both prebiotics and probiotics to stay healthy ( 5 ).
Probiotics  are healthy bacteria in your gut that break down certain foods, kill dangerous organisms, and create vitamins. Prebiotics can help feed these good bacteria ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
As it stimulates the growth and activity of helpful bacteria, apple pectin is considered a  prebiotic . What’s more, it may help inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria, such as  Clostridium  and  Bacteroides , in the digestive tract ( 6 ,  7 ).
Apple pectin is a prebiotic, promoting gut health by feeding the beneficial bacteria in your digestive tract.

2. May aid weight loss
Apple pectin may aid weight loss by delaying stomach emptying.
Slower digestion may help you feel full for longer. In turn, this may reduce your food intake, leading to  weight loss  ( 8 ).
In one 2-day study, 74 adults took 5–20 grams of pectin with orange juice after fasting overnight. Even those taking the smallest dose experienced  more fullness  and reduced food intake ( 9 ).
However, a 3-week study in 11 adults noted that supplementing with 27 grams of citrus-peel pectin daily did not affect fullness or weight loss ( 10 ).
This is why more research is needed.
Pectin may help you feel full for longer, which could aid weight loss. However, results are mixed, and further studies are necessary.

3. May control blood sugar
Soluble fiber like pectin is believed to decrease blood sugar levels, which could aid conditions like  type 2 diabetes  ( 11 ).
In a small, 4-week study, 12 people with type 2 diabetes took 20 grams of apple pectin daily and experienced improved blood sugar responses ( 14 ).
Yet, a review noted that standard doses of any type of pectin do not seem to  reduce blood sugar levels  ( 12 ,  13 ).
As such, further studies are necessary.
Apple pectin may aid blood sugar control, but more studies are needed.

4. May aid heart health
Apple pectin may boost  heart health  by lowering cholesterol and blood pressure levels.
This substance binds to bile acids in your small intestine, which may help improve cholesterol levels ( 15 ).
An analysis of 67 studies in 2,990 adults determined that pectin reduced LDL (bad) cholesterol without affecting HDL (good) cholesterol. Overall, pectin tended to  lower total cholesterol  by 5–16% ( 15 ).
This is important, as elevated levels of total and LDL (bad) cholesterol are a major risk factor for heart disease ( 16 ).
Other human and animal studies have observed similar results ( 17 ,  18 ,  19 ,  20 ).
What’s more, apple pectin may affect blood pressure, which is another risk factor for heart disease ( 21 ).
A review of 43 studies showed that 9 grams of pectin per day for 7 weeks lowered both systolic and diastolic blood pressure — the top and bottom numbers in a reading, respectively. This effect was especially pronounced in people with high blood pressure ( 22 ).
However, more specific research on apple pectin and blood pressure is necessary.
Apple pectin may reduce risk factors for heart disease, including blood pressure and total and LDL (bad) cholesterol.

5. May relieve diarrhea and constipation
Constipation and diarrhea are common complaints. In fact, around 14% of people worldwide deal with chronic constipation ( 23 ).
Apple pectin may alleviate both diarrhea and constipation ( 24 ).
As a gel-forming fiber, pectin easily absorbs  water  and has been shown to normalize stools ( 24 ,  25 ).
In 2 studies, people who took 24 grams of pectin daily experienced fewer symptoms of diarrhea and  constipation  ( 26 ,  27 ).
Apple pectin is a gel-forming fiber that easily absorbs water, helping relieve both constipation and diarrhea.

6. May enhance iron absorption
There is some research showing that apple pectin may improve iron uptake.
Iron  is an essential mineral that transports oxygen throughout your body and makes red blood cells ( 28 ,  29 ).
This could be especially important for people with  anemia , a condition linked to weakness and fatigue that’s often caused by iron deficiency. Notably, the World Health Organization (WHO) asserts that over 30% of women globally who are of childbearing age are anemic ( 30 ).
People who are menstruating and anyone following a vegan or vegetarian diet are at a particularly high risk of iron deficiency. Menstruation can trigger iron loss, while iron found in plant-based diets isn’t absorbed as well as iron from animal foods ( 31 ,  32 ).
Yet, research on apple pectin provides mixed results.
While one rat study showed that pectin enhanced iron absorption, another did not ( 33 ,  34 ).
Therefore, research that includes humans is needed.
Apple pectin may improve iron absorption, but results are mixed. Thus, more studies are necessary.

7. May improve acid reflux
Pectin may improve acid reflux symptoms.
Around 20% of adults in the United States have acid reflux, a condition in which stomach acid rises into your esophagus. It may lead to  heartburn  or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) when it occurs too often ( 35 ,  36 ).
In a study in 18 children with cerebral palsy on tube feedings, those who received pectin in their formulas experienced fewer and less severe episodes of  acid reflux  ( 37 ).
Yet, because of the limited nature of this study, more research is necessary.
Apple pectin may improve acid reflux, but further research is necessary.

8. May strengthen hair and skin
Hair loss affects millions of people and is considered difficult to treat ( 38 ).
Anecdotal evidence associates apple pectin with stronger hair and skin. It has even been added to cosmetic products, such as shampoos, with the promise of fuller hair ( 39 ).
However, no scientific evidence links pectin to hair or  skin health .
Your best bet is to eat  whole apples , as their vitamin C content supports healthy skin ( 40 ).
Many people believe that apple pectin boosts hair and skin health, but studies don’t currently back this claim.

9. May offer anticancer effects
Diet plays a role in  cancer development and progression , with increased fruit and vegetable intake potentially lowering your risk ( 41 ).
Test-tube studies suggest that pectin may fight prostate and colon cancer cells ( 42 ,  43 ,  44 ).
One rat study revealed that  citrus pectin  reduced the spread of prostate cancer — but failed to affect the primary tumor ( 45 ).
Although these studies are promising, further research is needed.
A few animal or test tube studies indicate that pectin may have anticancer effects, but more research including humans is necessary.

10. Easy to add to your diet
Pectin is a common ingredient in jams and pie fillings, as it helps thicken and stabilize foods ( 1 ,  25 ).
Apple pectin is likewise available as a supplement.
Moreover, whole apples provide pectin, with the Granny Smith variety offering the highest amounts ( 2 ,  46 ).
It’s easy to eat apple slices raw, bake them with  cinnamon , or add them to smoothies. You can also mix them into your  oatmeal .
It’s simple to add apple pectin to your diet as a supplement, though whole apples — particularly the Granny Smith variety — also offer high amounts.

The bottom line
Apple pectin is a type of  soluble fiber  with several potential health benefits.
It may improve cholesterol, blood pressure,  gut health , and bowel stability, though results are mixed and more research is necessary.
You can consume it as a supplement, via jams and jellies, or by eating whole apples with the skin to get the max amount of pectin.
