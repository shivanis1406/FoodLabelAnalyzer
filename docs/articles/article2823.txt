Title: Does Celery Have Benefits for Men?

Consuming celery and its juice has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its purported health benefits, one of them being improved sexual health for men.
Despite the lofty claims of various media outlets, data on the specific health benefits of consuming celery remains limited.
Nevertheless, some may wonder whether consuming celery has benefits for men.
This article details the potential effects of eating celery on several markers of men’s sexual health.

Myths vs. science
Various myths are circulating regarding celery’s purported benefits. Here’s what science has to say about some of the most common ones.
Androsterone is a weak steroid metabolite of the sex hormone  testosterone , which naturally occurs in both sexes, although to a greater extent in men than in women ( 1 ).
This hormone, in conjunction with others, contributes to male characteristics like body hair and is found in human sweat ( 1 ).
Several media sources claim that celery is packed with androsterone and thus can lead to increased testosterone levels and sex drive in men.
Although some studies show that celery contains androsterone, there’s no evidence that eating celery or drinking its juice increases androsterone levels or improves sex drive in men ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
Aphrodisiacs  are foods or drugs that stimulate sexual desire.
Pheromones are chemical hormones that function outside of the body and play a role in various phenomena, one of which is sexual attraction ( 6 ).
Androsterone is considered a pheromone, as it’s found in small amounts in human sweat ( 7 ).
Some claim that celery can serve as an aphrodisiac due to its pheromonic properties when eaten, though little to no research has been conducted on this subject. Therefore, more data is needed to confirm this potential effect.
While several media sources claim that celery can boost androsterone levels and serve as an aphrodisiac, limited to no data supports this theory, and more research is necessary.

Other potential benefits
Though data on the specific effects of celery intake on male sexual health is limited, celery may provide some other potential benefits.
Celery is high in vitamin C and phytonutrients, which are antioxidant plant compounds that have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties ( 8 ,  9 ).
While antioxidants can help reduce disease risk, they may also promote male sexual health ( 8 ,  10 ,  11 ).
More specifically, select human studies suggest that a high antioxidant intake can help  improve sperm count  and motility, both vital factors in male fertility ( 10 ,  12 ).
One animal study observed an increase in sperm production when supplementing with celery leaf extract ( 13 ).
However, extracts are much more concentrated and don’t necessarily compare to eating celery or drinking its juice.
Moreover, additional human research is needed to determine the specific benefits of celery on male fertility.
Celery and its juice may also aid  blood pressure control  ( 14 ).
This is likely due to the naturally occurring  nitrates  found in celery, which can promote heart health and help lower blood pressure ( 15 ,  16 ).
What’s more, high blood pressure has been repeatedly linked to erectile dysfunction in men ( 17 ,  18 ,  19 ).
That said, regularly consuming a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, including celery, may improve symptoms of erectile dysfunction, though more data is needed on this subject to establish its specific benefits ( 20 ).
Lastly, depending on the degree of high blood pressure, prescription drugs may also be required. As such, it’s best to consult your healthcare provider.
Celery is a rich  source of vitamin K , with 1 cup (124 grams) providing around 30% of the daily requirement for men ( 21 ,  22 )
Vitamin K is an important nutrient for blood clotting and bone health ( 23 ).
While the bacteria in your gut produce some vitamin K, dietary sources are required to help meet the daily requirement, which is around 120 mcg for men ( 24 ).
Regularly eating celery is a great way to help maintain vitamin K levels, in turn promoting bone health and efficient blood clotting.
Though data on the effect of celery on men’s health is limited, it may provide a few potential benefits, including promoting fertility, regulating blood pressure, and providing a rich source of vitamin K.

The bottom line
Consuming celery and its juice is an emerging health trend that claims to offer various benefits related to men’s sexual health, though data is lacking.
While it may marginally contribute to fertility, as well as help regulate blood pressure, more data is needed to determine its specific effects on other factors surrounding male sexual health.
That said, including celery and its  juice  as a part of an overall balanced diet is an excellent way to improve your nutritional intake and reap the benefits of the antioxidants it provides.
