Title: 7 Health Benefits of Yerba Mate (Backed by Science)

Yerba mate contains antioxidants, caffeine, and several nutrients. Some research suggests it may enhance physical performance, boost energy levels, and support weight management.
Yerba mate is a traditional South American drink that’s gaining worldwide popularity.
It’s said to have the strength of coffee, the health benefits of tea, and the joy of chocolate.
Here are the top 7 health benefits of yerba mate.

What is yerba mate?
Yerba mate is an herbal tea made from the leaves and stems of the  Ilex paraguariensis  plant ( 1 ).
The leaves are typically dried over a fire, then steeped in hot water to make the tea.
Yerba mate is traditionally consumed from a container called a gourd and sipped with a metal straw that has a filter at its lower end to strain out the leaf fragments ( 2 ).
Sharing it from this traditional gourd is said to be a sign of friendship and bonding.
Yerba mate is a type of tea made from the dried leaves and stems of the  Ilex paraguariensis  plant.

1. Rich in antioxidants and nutrients
Yerba mate contains several beneficial plant compounds, including ( 3 ):
Xanthines:  These compounds act as stimulants. They include  caffeine  and theobromine, which are also found in tea, coffee, and chocolate.
Caffeoyl derivatives:  These compounds are the main health-promoting antioxidants in the tea.
Saponins:  These bitter compounds have certain anti-inflammatory and cholesterol-lowering properties.
Polyphenols:  This is a large group of antioxidants, linked to a reduced risk of many diseases.
Interestingly, according to one older study, the antioxidant power of yerba mate tea is similar to that of  green tea  ( 4 ).
Yerba mate also contains several other important  micronutrients , including vitamin C, thiamine, riboflavin, and vitamin B6. Plus, it provides some potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, and iron ( 5 ).
However, the tea contains very small amounts of these nutrients, so it’s unlikely to make a large contribution to your diet on its own.
Yerba mate is an antioxidant powerhouse that contains many beneficial plant compounds and nutrients.

2. Can boost energy and improve mental focus
At 80 milligrams (mg) of caffeine per cup, yerba mate contains about the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee ( 5 ).
Therefore, just like any other caffeinated food or beverage, it may  increase your energy  levels and make you feel less tired.
Caffeine can also affect the levels of certain signaling molecules in your brain, making it particularly beneficial for your mental focus ( 6 ).
Some research reports that caffeine can improve alertness, attention, and reaction time in participants who consumed a single dose containing 40–300 mg of caffeine ( 7 ).
Additionally, those who regularly consume yerba mate often rave that it enhances alertness like coffee, but without the jittery side effects.
However, these testimonials have not yet been scientifically proven.
Thanks to its caffeine content, yerba mate can help increase your energy levels and boost your mental focus.

3. May enhance physical performance
Caffeine is also known to improve muscle contractions, reduce fatigue, and improve  sports performance  by up to 5%, according to some older studies ( 8 ,  9 ,  10 ).
Since yerba mate contains a moderate amount of caffeine, those drinking it can expect similar physical performance benefits.
In fact, in one 2014 study, those given a 1-gram (g) capsule of ground yerba mate leaves right before exercise burned 24% more fat during moderate intensity exercise ( 11 ).
A higher reliance on fat for fuel during exercise spares your carb reserves for critical high intensity moments, such as cycling up a hill or sprinting towards the finish line. This could translate into better sports performance.
However, the optimal amount of yerba mate to drink before exercise is currently unknown.
Yerba mate increases your body’s reliance on fat for fuel during exercise. It may also improve muscle contractions and reduce fatigue, all of which may contribute to better physical performance.

4. May protect against infections
Yerba mate may help prevent infections from bacteria, parasites, and fungi.
Some older test-tube studies found that a high dose of yerba mate extract deactivated  E. coli , a bacteria that causes  food poisoning  symptoms like stomach cramps and diarrhea ( 12 ,  13 ).
Compounds in yerba mate may also prevent the growth of  Malassezia furfur , a type of fungus responsible for scaly skin,  dandruff , and certain skin rashes ( 14 ).
Nevertheless, most of these studies were done on isolated cells. It’s currently unclear if these benefits are the same for humans, and more high quality, recent research is needed.
Yerba mate may have some anti-bacterial, anti-parasitic, and anti-fungal properties. However, more recent research in humans is needed.

5. May help you lose weight and belly fat
Some research suggests that yerba mate may help support weight management and could be effective for reducing body weight, belly fat, and body mass index ( 15 ).
It seems to decrease the total number of fat cells and reduce the amount of fat they hold ( 16 ).
Human research suggests that it can also increase the amount of stored fat that’s burned for energy ( 11 ,  17 ).
Furthermore, in a 2015 study in people with overweight, those given 3 g of yerba mate powder per day lost an average of 1.5 pounds (lbs), or 0.7 kilograms (kg). They also reduced their waist-to-hip ratio by 2%, which indicates  lost belly fat  ( 18 ).
In comparison, the participants given a placebo gained an average of 6.2 lbs (2.8 kg) and increased their waist-to-hip ratio by 1% over the same 12-week period ( 18 ).
Yerba mate may boost metabolism and increase the amount of fat burned for fuel. This could help you lose weight.

6. Lowers blood sugar levels
Yerba mate may help  lower blood sugar  and reduce complications associated with diabetes.
In fact, one animal study found that it could even improve insulin signaling ( 19 ).
It may also reduce the formation of  advanced glycation end-products  (AGEs), which are involved in the development and worsening of many conditions, including diabetes ( 20 ,  21 ,  22 ).
In one 2011 study, people with type 2 diabetes consumed 11 ounces (oz), or 330 milliliters (mL), of yerba mate three times daily. After 2 months, they had significantly lower levels of fasting blood sugar and  hemoglobin A1c , a marker of long-term blood sugar control ( 23 ).
Still, more high quality research is needed to understand how yerba mate may affect blood sugar levels in humans.
Yerba mate may improve insulin signaling and blood sugar control. However, more human research is needed.

7. May lower your risk of heart disease
Yerba mate contains antioxidant compounds, such as caffeoyl derivatives and  polyphenols , which may protect against heart disease ( 3 ).
Some animal studies also report that mate extract may provide some protection against heart disease ( 24 ,  25 ).
In humans, yerba mate seems to reduce  cholesterol levels .
One study in 119 females with overweight found that daily consumption of yerba mate led to reductions total and LDL (bad) cholesterol over a 12-week period. What’s more, yerba mate also significantly reduced levels of triglycerides when paired with a low calorie diet ( 26 ).
That said, more research is needed before strong conclusions can be reached, as some studies have found that yerba mate has no significant effect on cholesterol levels ( 27 ).
Yerba mate’s antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cholesterol-lowering properties may help protect against heart disease.

How to prepare yerba mate
Yerba mate is traditionally served in a container called a gourd, also known as a calabash ( 5 ).
It’s commonly sipped through a metal straw that has a filter on its lower end to strain out the leaf fragments.
To prepare mate, fill the bottom third of the calabash with dried or toasted mate leaves prior to adding hot water.
If you do not own a calabash, you can prepare it in a French press.
The tea is often served with burnt sugar,  lemon  juice, or  milk  and can be topped off with hot water several times before using new leaves to make a new batch.
Although traditionally consumed hot, yerba mate may also be served cold, especially in hot climates.
Yerba mate can be consumed hot or cold and is prepared similarly to other loose teas. It’s traditionally served in a gourd, or calabash.

Safety and side effects
Yerba mate is unlikely to cause harm to healthy adults who drink it occasionally.
However, those who drink it regularly may be at increased risk of several conditions.
Studies show that drinking large amounts of  yerba mate  for a long time may increase your risk of upper respiratory and digestive tract cancers ( 28 ,  29 ,  30 ).
One possible explanation is that mate contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are known carcinogens also found in tobacco smoke and grilled meat ( 28 ).
It’s also often consumed at very hot temperatures. This could damage respiratory and digestive tract lining, increasing your risk of cancerous cell formation ( 5 ,  30 ).
However, some compounds in it may protect against other types of  cancer  ( 31 ,  32 ).
Yerba mate contains caffeine. Too much caffeine can cause  headaches , migraines, and high blood pressure in some individuals ( 33 ).
Pregnant people should limit mate intake to a maximum of 12 oz (355 mL) per day. Too much caffeine may increase your risk of miscarriage and preterm birth ( 34 ).
Studies show that certain compounds in yerba mate have monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) activity. MAOIs are often prescribed as medications for depression and Parkinson’s disease ( 35 ).
Therefore, individuals taking MAOI drugs should use yerba mate with caution.
Finally, due to its caffeine content, it may also interact with the muscle relaxant Zanaflex or the antidepressant Luvox. Individuals taking these drugs should avoid yerba mate, as it can increase the effects of the drugs ( 36 ).
Frequent consumption of yerba mate may increase your risk of certain cancers. Pregnant people and individuals sensitive to caffeine or taking certain prescribed medications should drink it with caution.

The bottom line
Yerba mate may not be suitable for everyone, and drinking it regularly at very hot temperatures may increase your risk of certain cancers.
However, this beverage also contains various beneficial compounds linked to impressive health benefits.
If you’d like to give yerba mate a try, start slowly and make sure to let it cool a little before drinking it.
