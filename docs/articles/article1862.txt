Title: Are There Benefits to Apple Cider Vinegar Gummies?

Though drinking apple cider vinegar has been associated with several possible benefits, more research is needed to determine how apple cider vinegar gummies may affect health.
Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is a multipurpose ingredient used for everything from cleaning to cooking.
The wellness world has embraced ACV, promoting it as a natural remedy for many health conditions.
Recently, ACV supplements — including apple cider vinegar gummies — have soared in popularity.
These gummies claim to support immune function, promote weight loss, boost metabolism, “detox” your body, and regulate your blood sugar levels.
But do these ACV gummies offer health benefits?
This article introduces apple cider vinegar gummies, exploring whether they could support your overall health and if they’re worth adding to your diet.

What are apple cider vinegar gummies?
Apple cider vinegar gummies are dietary supplements that contain ACV concentrate and other ingredients like vitamins and fruit extracts.
ACV gummy supplements were created to deliver the “benefits” of ACV without the harsh taste of drinking  pure ACV .
Apple cider vinegar contains a compound called acetic acid, which is produced during the fermentation process used to create ACV.
Medical researchers named acetic acid as the component of ACV that may help your blood sugar, blood lipids, athletic performance, and the health of your skin ( 1 ,  2 ).
You can find a number of ACV gummy supplements available online or in local stores. Most ACV gummies contain a similar ingredient list.
Most ACV gummy products contain ACV powder,  B vitamins , fruit extracts from beets and pomegranates, natural flavors, pectin, and sugar. Still, formulations do vary from product to product.
For example, some ACV gummies contain only ACV with sweeteners and fillers while others contain ACV plus a whole host of vitamins, minerals, and fruit extracts.
Although some ACV gummies don’t disclose how much ACV is in the supplement, most gummies contain around 500 mg of ACV — often containing 5% acetic acid — per dose. Some supplements recommend taking multiple doses per day.
Here’s what’s in a serving (1 gummy) of Goli ACV gummies, one of the most popular ACV supplements on the market ( 3 ):
Calories:  15
Sugar:  2 grams
Apple cider vinegar powder:  500 mg
Organic beetroot:  40 mcg
Organic pomegranate:  40 mcg
Folic acid:  50% of the Daily Value (DV)
Vitamin B12:  50% of the DV
Goli ACV gummies also contain organic tapioca syrup, water, organic cane sugar, pectin, sodium citrate, citric acid, malic acid, natural apple flavors, and organic fruit and vegetable juice.
Companies that produce ACV gummies claim that consuming these supplements can support your immune function, promote weight loss, and enhance your ability to regulate your blood sugar.
These claims helped make ACV gummies a popular and profitable health supplement. However, most of these supposed benefits look either exaggerated or unfounded in recent studies.
ACV gummies typically contain about 500 mg of ACV powder per serving — along with added vitamins, minerals, and fruit powders. They were created to deliver the “benefits” of ACV without the harsh taste of drinking pure ACV.

Are there benefits to taking apple cider vinegar gummies?
While some studies suggest that drinking ACV may improve some aspects of your health, most of the claims associated with taking ACV gummies remain unproven.
A review of 9 studies found that  ACV consumption  reduced total cholesterol and fasting blood sugar — though ACV may have only had an effect on the fasting participants with diabetes, as their blood sugar and cholesterol benefits only began to show after 8 weeks ( 4 ).
However, the ACV doses used in the studies included in this review ranged from 0.5 to 26 ounces (15–770 mL) per day. You cannot compare this with taking ACV gummy supplements with 500 mg of ACV powder ( 4 ).
Interestingly, a small, randomized control study found that vinegar supplements do not have the same effect on blood sugar as liquid vinegar ( 5 ).
The study showed that the liquid vinegar resulted in a 31% greater reduction in post-meal blood sugar compared with the control and whole vinegar tablets. Liquid vinegar also proved more effective than the vinegar tablets dissolved in water ( 5 ).
All this suggests that ACV supplements don’t have the same effect on blood sugar as drinking ACV.
There are no current studies investigating the effects of ACV gummies on  blood sugar . Also, keep in mind that ACV gummies may often contain added sugar — which can impact your blood sugar levels.
Health marketers claim that taking ACV gummies can promote weight loss. Research concludes that this claim is baseless.
A review of 13 human and 13 animal studies concluded that there was not enough credible evidence to determine whether ACV has any beneficial effects on weight loss ( 6 ).
More comprehensive research is needed before suggesting that ACV gummies offer any help in weight management.
The most recent study may show potential weight loss benefits to those who consumed at least 0.5 ounces (15 ml) of organic liquid ACV — not ACV gummies ( 7 ).
No evidence suggests that ACV gummies aid in managing weight.
Any supposed health benefits of ACV gummies may come from the added vitamins and minerals in the supplement.
For example, if you’re low in vitamin B12 and consume B12 in the form of ACV gummies, this may help increase your body’s B12 levels.
However, even though you need B12 and other B vitamins to stay energized and combat fatigue, you may be disappointed to discover that ACV gummies may not boost your energy as advertised ( 8 ).
If you have trouble getting enough vitamin B, you would get similar or better results from taking a B complex vitamin every day. The same can be applied to the other vitamins and minerals that have been added to ACV gummies.
Furthermore, claims that ACV gummies help your body detox or boost your immunity remain unfounded.
Some ACV gummies advertise that added fruit extracts provide significant antioxidant effects. However, most ACV gummies contain trace amounts of these ingredients — likely too low to offer you any health benefits.
Some studies show that taking beetroot and pomegranate juices — ingredients in many ACV gummies — help reduce markers of  inflammation .
However, you would need to consume far more than the 40 mcg dose provided by ACV gummies to see any anti-inflammatory benefits ( 9 ,  10 ).
For example, a review found that pomegranate supplements may be effective in reducing inflammatory markers like interleukin-6 (IL-6). Yet, the lowest dose used in the studies included in the review was 500 mg ( 9 ).
Most ACV gummies — including Goli — contain 40 mcg each of pomegranate and beetroot. This equates to 0.004 mg ( 9 ).
The scant vitamin and mineral contents in ACV gummies may contain the right compounds to support your health, but they contain a fraction of the necessary servings for you to see any obvious health benefits.
Although drinking ACV may help reduce blood lipid levels and blood sugar levels in some people, these findings can’t be applied to ACV supplements or gummies — as gummies may provide only trace amounts of vitamins and minerals.

Downsides of apple cider vinegar gummies
Medical researchers consider ACV and ACV supplements safe and without significant  side effects , especially when taken in the low doses contained in gummy supplements ( 6 ).
While these ACV gummies may prove harmless, you may find them not worth your purchase.
Some evidence suggests that drinking pure ACV in liquid form may help reduce blood sugar and blood lipid levels in people with type 2 diabetes when taken in doses of 0.5–26 ounces (15–770 mL) per day.
Still, there’s no current evidence that ACV gummies offer the same effect ( 4 ).
Plus, consider that ACV gummies contain as much as 1 gram (1/4 teaspoon) of added sugar per gummy. This can add up if you’re taking a few per day, which the label often recommends.
Not only can consuming too much added  sugar harm your teeth  but added sugar increases your blood sugar levels. This contradicts the claim that taking ACV gummies may help reduce blood sugar ( 11 ).
If you’re interested in the possible blood sugar and cholesterol-lowering benefits of ACV, you’re better off drinking pure ACV diluted in water than taking ACV gummies.
Consult a healthcare professional before adding ACV into your diet — especially if you have a medical condition like diabetes. They can also advise you on safe and effective doses of ACV.
Save your money and opt for nutritious and vitamin-rich foods in your diet, a consistent exercise routine, and proper medical consulting on any underlying medical issues.
Even though ACV gummies are unlikely to harm health, there’s no evidence that ACV gummies provide any benefits.

The bottom line
ACV gummies found widespread popularity in the wellness community, but there’s no evidence that they provide any health benefits.
Claims that these supplements offer support with your blood sugar levels, weight loss goals, inflammation, detoxification, and energy levels remain unfounded.
Although there’s some evidence that drinking ACV may reduce blood lipid levels and blood sugar levels in some people, these findings can’t be applied to ACV supplements or gummies.
You may find it best to avoid ACV gummies. Focus on evidence-based ways to improve your health like following a nutrient-dense diet, properly managing medical conditions, and staying active.
Try this today:  Measure out a half glass of water, along with a half glass of apple cider vinegar. You can even add a dash of fruit juice to mask the vinegar flavor. Drink it quickly and plug your nose if you find the taste unappealing. You could also use ACV in a  salad dressing  or  marinade .
When it comes to ACV, save your  gummy intake  for the occasional candy!
