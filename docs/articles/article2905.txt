Title: Ro Review: A Dietitian’s Review of the Telehealth Service

Ro offers a convenient way to access services and products for sexual health, fertility, weight loss, and skin and hair health. However, reviews are mixed. Read on for our dietitian’s review.
Ro is a direct-to-consumer  telehealth  company that offers prescription medications and over-the-counter (OTC) products designed to address a variety of health issues.
Modern Fertility, the Ro Body Program, and the Ro Sperm Kit are three of the company’s popular products and services.
While some people may appreciate the convenience Ro offers, its online reputation is mixed.
In this article, our dietitian Rachael Ajmera, MS, RD, takes an in-depth look at Ro, including what it is, what products and services it offers, and what customers are saying about it.

What is Ro?
Ro is a  telehealth platform  that aims to help bring healthcare home with products and services designed to address a wide range of health concerns.
Ro allows you to connect with a doctor, nurse, or coach for free on its website or app. It also provides a variety of prescription and OTC medications, which are delivered directly to your door in discreet packaging.
Here’s a quick look at the conditions Ro treats and how it works:
What Ro treats:  Ro offers medications to address issues related to sexual health, weight loss, fertility, hair loss, and skin health. This includes  at-home ovulation tests , birth control, and treatments for conditions such as erectile dysfunction and herpes.
Insurance:  The products and services Ro offers are not covered by insurance, which means you need to pay out of pocket. Some products may be eligible for reimbursement from your health savings account (HSA) or flexible spending account (FSA).
Cost:  With the exception of the Ro Body Program, your online visit is free in most cases. The cost of medications can vary depending on the specific medication, dose, and shipping frequency.
Ro Body Program:  The company’s weight management program pairs weight loss medications with a curriculum designed to promote healthy habits. It costs $99 for the first month and $145 for each month after that, not including the cost of medications.

Pros and cons
Ro offers treatment options for a wide variety of health conditions.
It can be a convenient and more accessible way to receive care.
Prescription medications ship quickly in discreet packaging.
The program includes unlimited follow-ups with a healthcare professional.
Ro provides both OTC and prescription treatments.
Some products may be eligible for HSA or FSA reimbursement.
The products and services are not covered by insurance.
Ro may not be suitable for everyone, such as people without internet access, those who prefer face-to-face interactions, and those with limited experience using technology.
Some of the medications can be expensive.
Some of the supplements are not in full compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) supplement label guidelines.
Ro may prescribe compounded GLP-1 medications, which are not approved by the FDA.
Some reviewers complain about slow response times, lack of communication, and issues with shipping and billing.

Ro may be a good option for people who …
have certain health issues that can be treated virtually
live in rural areas with limited access to local healthcare professionals
are looking for a fast, simple, and convenient way to refill certain prescriptions
have physical disabilities or limited access to transportation

Ro is not ideal for those who …
are under 18 years old
have not visited a healthcare professional in the past 3 years
have chronic health conditions that require more comprehensive care
prefer in-person interactions with a healthcare professional
prefer a telehealth service that accepts their insurance
are experiencing serious injuries or medical emergencies
do not have internet access or have limited experience using technology

How does Ro work?
After joining, you can have a virtual visit with a licensed healthcare professional, such as a doctor or nurse practitioner, and receive a personalized treatment plan tailored to your needs.
You can also get prescription medications delivered directly to your door in as little as 2 days. These medications are sent from the company’s network of nationwide pharmacies.
You can chat with a doctor, nurse, or coach on the Ro platform for free at any time to address any health concerns.
However, Ro is not a replacement for a visit with a  primary care doctor  or healthcare team. Instead, it’s designed to provide complementary services to better support your health needs at home.
Below, we look at the services Ro offers.

Ro weight loss
Cost:  $99 for the first month and $145 per month thereafter. The cost of the program does not cover medications, which are billed separately.
The Ro Body Program is Ro’s weight loss program. The company claims that the program can help you lose an average of 15% to 20% of your body weight within 12 months.
This claim is based on the results of clinical trials that evaluated the effects of the weight loss medications offered through the Ro Body Program, including  Zepbound (tirzepatide)  and  Wegovy (semaglutide) .
These trials received funding from the manufacturers of the medications, which means there’s a potential for bias and conflict of interest.
The Ro Body Program includes:
personal coaching from a dedicated health coach
an at-home testing kit to evaluate your metabolism
ongoing support from a healthcare professional, including up to 24 video sessions per year
a step-by-step online curriculum to help you build healthy habits, with lessons focused on nutrition, sleep, emotional health, and exercise
Prescription weight loss medications may also be recommended for those who qualify.
The Ro Body Program also includes access to prescription  weight loss medications , including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, which are medications used to  treat type 2 diabetes  that  have also been shown  to support weight loss.
Ro prescribes several types of weight loss medications, including Wegovy, Ozempic, and Zepbound.
Wegovy was approved by the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  in 2021 to be used specifically as a weight loss medication. While Ozempic and Zepbound have been shown to support weight loss, they are approved only for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
These medications  can support  weight management by slowing the emptying of your stomach, increasing feelings of fullness, and decreasing your hunger to help reduce your food intake.
Ro also offers dual GLP-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) agonists. These medications  work in a similar way  to GLP-1 agonists to promote weight loss.
You can learn more about  Wegovy ,  Ozempic , and  Zepbound  in our comprehensive guides.
Accepts insurance   yes
Consultation fee   $99
Subscription fee   $145 per month
Available medications   Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound
Ro Body offers prescriptions for several weight loss medications, including  Zepbound , which is approved specifically for weight loss.
Zepbound features the same active ingredient as Mounjaro (tirzepatide) and offers the combined effects of GLP-1 and GIP activation. Early  research  suggests that tirzepatide might be more effective than semaglutide (Ozempic and Wegovy), though more studies are needed to confirm this.
According to Ro, compounded GLP-1 medications are also available through Ro at a lower cost. Drug compounding is a process that involves mixing, combining, or changing the ingredients of a drug to create a new medication.
Though these compounded GLP-1 medications contain the same active ingredient as branded versions, such as Ozempic, compounded medications  have been associated  with serious safety concerns and are not approved by the  FDA .

The company has been involved in several lawsuits regarding  digital accessibility ,  unsolicited marketing text messages , and  copyright infringement .
