“I was surprised by how easy the pill went down (cannot emphasize that enough) and that there was no aftertaste. No fishy burps or bad smells. Also love that the brand seems environmentally conscious. There is fish gelatin in the pill though, FYI!”
— Parisa Syed, Healthline editor
Omega-3 fatty acids play an important role in supporting heart, eye, and brain health, and for lowering inflammation and cholesterol, among other benefits.
They’re abundant in cold-water fatty fish and other seafood and in lesser amounts in plant-based foods, such as nuts, seeds, and plant oils.
But if you don’t eat these foods often, omega-3 supplementation through fish oil is an easy and helpful process to increase your intake of this essential nutrient.
Here are our picks of the best fish oil supplements on the market.
$  = under $1 per serving
$$  = $1 to $1.50 per serving
$$$  = over $1.50 per serving

Why it’s best overall:  Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega Soft Gels is a high quality supplement that provides 1,280 milligrams (mg) of combined EPA and DHA sourced from  wild-caught  sardines and anchovies.
These supplements are third party tested — much like all the products on this list — but the brand goes the extra mile by making the certificates of analysis (COA)  available on its website . This document provides detailed information on the purity, strength, and quality of supplements.
It’s registered dietitian  Kelli McGrane’s  pick as one of the best fish oil supplement options on the market. Plus, senior editor  Candice Abellon  notes that it was easy to swallow and caused fewer fishy burps than other brands.
What else to know:  The softgels are lemon flavored, which can help eliminate the fishy aftertaste often found in other fish oil supplements.
All Nordic Naturals products are certified by  Friend of the Sea , an organization that ensures that seafood is sourced from sustainable fisheries and aquaculture.
Nordic Naturals has been on dietitian  Kelli McGrane’s  radar for years as one of the most transparent supplement brands on the market.
“While the capsules are quite large, I’ve found them easy to swallow. Plus, as someone who dislikes the smell and taste of fish, I particularly appreciate that the softgels have a pleasant lemon flavor that masks any fishiness that might otherwise be off-putting.”
When testing in 2024, editor Candice Abellon found that she also did not experience as much fishy burps as she has with other brands and that the softgels were easy to swallow. The subtle lemon flavor made them manageable when they settled on her tongue for a bit.
“That telltale fishiness wasn’t there,” she said. “Holding two gel capsules in my hand, they just smell sweet, like they’re lemon candies. All together in the bottle, a whiff of that smells like medicinal lemon candy.”
While the product was provided to her for free, Abellon says she would buy them.

Why we picked it:  HUM Nutrition OMG! Omega-3 Softgels are designed to  support healthy skin  thanks to their inclusion of 13.4 mg of vitamin E in addition to DHA and EPA.
Some research  has found that inadequate intake of vitamin E may contribute to skin conditions, such as acne and atopic dermatitis. However, keep in mind that it’s unclear whether vitamin E supplements have any additional benefits if you’re already getting enough of this vitamin in your diet.
What else to know:  Each 2-capsule serving provides 1,400 mg of total omega-3s, including 400 mg of DHA and 800 mg of DHA, sourced from wild anchovies. While more research is needed,  studies  suggest that consuming adequate amounts of DHA and EPA may help protect against sun damage and keep your skin moisturized.
Our testers reported that the capsules are on the larger side (not unlike our overall pick) and did smell fishy, so it’s worth considering whether that’s a deal-breaker for you. But they did not result in any fishy taste or aftertaste.
All  HUM Nutrition  products are third-party tested, non-GMO, gluten-free, and free of artificial sweeteners and colors.
You can purchase these softgels without subscribing, but it’s much less expensive to sign up for a 3-month subscription.
We’ve tested these supplements twice since 2023, and both times, we found they did have a fishy aroma but no fishy taste.
Our first tester, contributor Jessica Timmons, also felt they were on the larger side compared with other omega-3 capsules she has tried in the past. “However, I like the brand and I have no problem swallowing bigger pills, so I would definitely continue with these,” she said.
Our editor Kristin Currin-Sheehan tried them again in 2024. She manages fibromyalgia and some of the brain fog that comes with it. She takes omegas-3s to support her mental acuity as well as some joint pain she experiences from early stages of arthritis.”
“I really, really like Nordic Naturals, and Hum seems to compare to level of focus, joint health, and bioavailability for my body,” she said.

Why we picked it:  This high quality fish oil supplement pairs omega-3 fatty acids with  coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) , a heart-healthy antioxidant that  protects against  oxidative damage and helps generate energy in your cells.
It’s worth noting that while CoQ10 supplements have been  linked  to benefits for heart health, exercise performance, and more, most studies suggest a dosage of at least 100 mg per day. Because this supplement only provides 30 mg, people interested in the benefits of CoQ10 may need to take an additional supplement.
What else to know:  Each capsule contains 630 mg of combined EPA and DHA sustainably sourced from cold-water fish, along with 30 mg of CoQ10.
Thorne’s fish oil supplement has been certified by the  Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) , an Australian government agency that regulates medications and supplements.
All Thorne Research products undergo four rounds of extensive testing to ensure that you’re getting the best quality possible. Thorne’s manufacturing facility is third-party certified by  NSF International .

Why we picked it:  This omega-3 supplement from FullWell provides EPA and DHA from small ocean fish, which are lower in mercury than other fish. High levels of mercury  can cause  developmental issues, so it’s important for pregnant people to be mindful of the  mercury  sources in their diet.
The softgels are also very small compared with others on our list and easy to swallow. Our editor Catherine Conelly purchased them and used them for about 2 years collectively (stopping after breastfeeding and starting again for her second pregnancy). She confirmed they are easy to swallow and didn’t cause the dreaded fish burps.
The supplement is third-party tested for the presence of heavy metals, such as mercury, and other potentially harmful substances. Like our best overall pick by Nordic Naturals, the testing results are also  easily accessible online.
Connelly also found that the capsules could be taken at any time of day without upsetting her stomach.
What else to know:  A daily fish oil supplement is a worthwhile addition to your daily prenatal vitamin during pregnancy.
Omega-3 fatty acids like DHA are necessary for brain development, and one  2021 study  found that women who supplemented with omega-3 in pregnancy had children with improved early language development and fewer behavioral issues.
Additionally, omega-3 supplementation while breastfeeding  can ensure  that infants are getting enough DHA and EPA via breast milk.
FullWell’s omega-3 supplement provides 600 mg of EPA and DHA per serving. While there is currently no recommended dietary allowance for omega-3s during pregnancy, the  European Food Safety Authority  recommends aiming for at least 250 mg of combined EPA and DHA per day while pregnant.
Our editor Catherine Conelly started taking these along with  FullWell’s prenatal supplement  near the end of her first pregnancy, throughout 1 year of postpartum and breastfeeding, and then again for her second pregnancy.
“I absolutely love that I have not experienced any fishy burps from the DHA, which I know can be common with this ingredient, she said. This is something she did experience with other prenatal supplements that contains EPA and DHA.
She also found that they are small and easy to swallow — no scary-looking large capsules that can be common with omega-3 supplements. And she never experienced an unsettled stomach.
“It doesn’t seem to matter for me whether I take them with or without food. If I forgot to take them during the day, I can easily take them before bed without having to worry about any queasiness keeping me up.”

Why we picked it:  Mindbodygreen’s omega-3 supplement features organic lemon oil and rosemary extract to help mask the unpleasant taste and smell of  fish oil . Our tester particularly enjoyed the taste and the lack of fishy smell.
What else to know:  The softgels are on the larger side, so they may not be a good option if you don’t like to swallow pills.
Each 2-capsule serving provides 1,500 mg of total omega-3s, sourced from wild-caught anchovies.
Omega-3 potency+ is certified by  ORIVO , a third-party organization that confirms purity and potency of omega-3 supplements.
Since this is a higher potency product, it’s worth noting that doses over 900 mg of EPA plus 600 mg DHA can  lead to  immune system suppression, bleeding problems, and other side effects. We recommend talking with your healthcare professional about how much fish oil may benefit you based on any unique health conditions.

Jenna Shippee, Healthline content analyst, tried mindbodygreen’s omega-3 supplement for a few weeks and was initially impressed with the stylish design of the bottle, which stood out from the colorful plastic bottles usually used for supplements.
While she was intimidated by the size of the pills at first, she found that they were actually relatively easy to swallow and didn’t have the same strong fishy odor or fish taste as other supplements.

“As directed, I took the pills with food, choosing to have it each morning with my breakfast,” she said. “I was happily surprised to not have any taste, knowing these are made of anchovy. Also, I know ‘fish burps’ are common with fish oil supplements, but I did not experience any burping.”
“The price point is high enough that it does give me pause to continue with this brand, although I have enjoyed the tasteless aspect and just the overall look.”

Why we picked it:  Made from single-source, wild-caught Alaskan pollock, Sports Research stands out as a high quality, budget-friendly omega-3 option.
According to the manufacturers, it uses a 10-step refinement process, resulting in an ultra-concentrated dose and no fishy aftertaste or burps. Our tester backs this up, reporting that the oil went down easy, didn’t smell bad, and didn’t cause any unpleasant fishy burps when she tried it.
What else to know:  This supplement is available in two different doses and provides either 625 mg or 1,250 mg of fish oil per serving, with 520 mg or 1,040 mg of omega-3s per serving, respectively.
In addition to being third-party tested, this product is also gluten-free, non-GMO tested, and IFOS 5-star certified.
The brand offers multiple sizes, along with convenient subscriptions at a discounted rate.
Healthline editor Parisa Syed tried this supplement for 30 days and found that while the size of the softgels was off-putting at first and on the larger side, the vitamins went down easier than she thought when first looking at them.
“I was actually pretty nervous about swallowing the fish oil pill. It’s a pretty big pill–the meds I take daily are a fraction of the size,” she said. “I was surprised by how easy the pill went down (cannot emphasize that enough) and that there was no aftertaste. No fishy burps or bad smells.”
For the entire month she took these fish oil softgels, she did not experience any issues swallowing or with aftertaste. She simply took the vitamins with food and had no problem going about her day without any side effects.

Why we picked it:  Cod liver oil is a unique type of fish oil pressed from the livers of cod, a type of fish that’s also a  rich source  of the fat-soluble vitamins A and D in addition to omega-3s. It’s made by the same brand as out top overall pick, which we know to be very transparent about where it sources ingredients.
This product also received a rave review from our tester, who described the orange-flavored variety as a “game-changer” and reported experiencing less dry skin after just a few weeks of taking it.
We definitely recommend choosing one of the flavored options over the unflavored, which was quite fishy in taste and smell.
What else to know:  Sourced exclusively from wild  Arctic cod  from the Norwegian Sea, this supplement is available in liquid fish oil and softgel forms. It provides 600 to 850 mg of combined EPA and DHA, depending on which product you select.
Nordic Naturals supplements are sustainably produced, non-GMO, and certified by third-party organizations, such as  Friend of the Sea  and  European Pharmacopoeia .
This product is available in several flavors, including unflavored, orange, strawberry, and lemon.
Healthline team member Rita Mauceri has attempted to take fish oil in the past but always stopped because of the size of the capsules. “I’m not sure why they tend to be huge, but they’re very hard for me to swallow. Honestly, that’s been a real stopper for me in taking omega-3s,” she said.
She has always wanted them to be part of her regimen for their overall health benefits, along with the skin and hair benefits, so trying this oil form was a game-changer.
“I don’t use that phrase lightly. As someone who has struggled to find a fish oil that I can actually take every morning, this was such a brilliantly simple solution.”
After using it for about 3 weeks, she noticed her was skin wasn’t as dry without making any other changes to her skin care routine. But she highly recommends choosing one of the flavored options.
She tried both the orange and the unflavored options and found that the orange was subtle — easy to take without any overpowering or artificial taste.
The unflavored, however, was just what you might expect: fishy, fishy, fishy. “I tried it for about a week, but honestly, with the much more pleasant orange-flavored oil, it was no competition.”

How we chose the best fish oil supplements
When rounding up the best fish oil supplements, we considered the following factors:
Vetting:  All the products included were  vetted  to ensure they meet Healthline’s medical and business standards, including but not limited to:  adhering to allowable health claims and labeling requirements, per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations manufactured in facilities that adhere to current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs) established by the FDA produced by medically credible companies that follow ethical, legal, and industry best standards
adhering to allowable health claims and labeling requirements, per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations
manufactured in facilities that adhere to current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs) established by the FDA
produced by medically credible companies that follow ethical, legal, and industry best standards
Quality:  In addition to the quality of ingredients, we looked at the company’s testing and manufacturing processes. The products selected are made by companies that provide objective measures of trust, such as having their supplements validated by third-party labs.
Fish oil source:  We prioritized supplements with oil from smaller fish because they’re  typically lower  in mercury than larger fish.
Certifications:  We prioritized products with additional certifications from independent organizations to help ensure quality, transparency, and safety beyond third-party testing. However, we also included many products that use other methods to verify quality.
Tester reviews:  Our team tried many of the supplements on our list and provided firsthand feedback on their experience to help us decide which products to include.
Price:  We included products to suit a variety of budgets.
Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the brands on this page, we considered all the vitamin brands that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further.
The  Very Finest Fish Oil by Carlson Labs  is a great option if you prefer taking a liquid than swallowing a softgel. It’s sourced from wild-caught anchovies,  sardines , and mackerel. It’s certified by  IFOS  and non-GMO verified.
But it’s very high potency. Each teaspoon (5 milliliters) contains 1,600 mg of omega-3 fatty acids, with 1,300 mg from EPA and DHA. Therefore, you may want to speak with a trusted healthcare professional about what dose you actually need to avoid risks of immune system suppression.
If you need a pretty high dose,  Viva Naturals Omega-3 Fish Oil Softgels  is also a great option. It’s IFOS certified, gluten-free, and produced from small, wild-caught fish like mackerel, anchovies, and sardines.
If you prefer gummies, consider  NatureMade Fish Oil Gummies . However, keep in mind that these gummies supply a much lower dose of omega-3 fatty acids than most other fish oil and omega-3 supplements. They also contain 3 grams (g) of added sugar per serving.

A comparison of the best fish oil supplements

What to consider when shopping for a fish oil supplement
Supplement quality:  It’s important to check the ingredient list carefully and steer clear of supplements containing fillers or artificial ingredients. Aim to look for products that have undergone third-party testing and are certified by an independent organization such as IFOS, USP, NSF International, or the TGA.
Omega-3 content:  Look for supplements that contain around  250 to 500 mg  of combined  EPA and DHA  per serving. Some products may also contain  ALA , a form of omega-3 fatty acid found in plants that’s converted to EPA and DHA in  small amounts .
Serving size:  Some supplements may require you to take multiple capsules or gummies each day while others provide the entire dose in a single shot. If this is important to you, be sure to check the recommended serving size prior to purchasing.
Fish oil source:  You may want to consider the source of the fish oil as well. Ideally, opt for smaller, sustainably caught fatty fish, like sardines and anchovies, which  tend to contain  lower  levels of mercury .
Supplement type:  There are also several forms of fish oil supplements, including softgels, liquids, or gummies. Which one works best for you will largely be a matter of preference.
Freshness:  Purchasing from a reputable brand can help ensure that you’re getting fish oil at its peak freshness. In fact, some supplements may undergo third-party testing to check for oxidation, which can be a sign of rancidity. You should also check the expiration date carefully and avoid buying in large batches to maintain freshness.

What are the benefits of fish oil?
Fish oil is a top source of omega-3 fatty acids, called polyunsaturated fats, which play important roles in many processes in your body,  including  those involving inflammation, immunity, heart health, and brain function.
There are  three main types  of omega-3 fatty acids:
Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA):  These are primarily found in fish and are biologically active forms of omega-3. This means they’re in a form that the body can use.
Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA):  This is found in plant foods, and your body  must convert  it to EPA and DHA in order to use it.
All omega-3s are anti-inflammatory and may have a positive effect on many conditions thought to be related to chronic inflammation — particularly heart disease. EPA and DHA may also  help lower  high  triglyceride levels , a risk factor for heart disease.
Additionally, omega-3s play a key role in vision and eye health, as they’re necessary for eye development. However, while some studies suggest that they  may help  in the treatment of  dry eye disease , other research has turned up  conflicting results .
Omega-3s are also important for brain health. During infancy and childhood, they’re  necessary  for proper neurological development.
In older adults, omega-3 supplementation may play a role in  promoting  brain function and preventing cognitive decline.

Potential side effects of fish oil
The most  common side effect  of fish oil supplements is fishy burps, but there are now several “burpless” fish oil products on the market that claim to cut down on this unpleasant but harmless side effect.
Some people might also experience digestive issues after taking fish oil, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.
If you experience nausea or vomiting after taking fish oil, you can check the expiration date. The oil may deteriorate and become rancid. Consider lowering your dose or taking the supplement with a meal to decrease any uncomfortable side effects.
Also check with a doctor before taking fish oil if you’re taking other medications or have any underlying health conditions, as high doses could  increase  the risk of bleeding or suppress immune function.

Frequently asked questions about fish oil supplements
Research on the potential effects of fish oil on cholesterol levels is conflicting. According to a  2021 study , higher blood levels of DHA could be linked to lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels.
On the other hand, one review concluded that fish oil supplements could actually  increase  LDL cholesterol, while other research  suggests  that eating fresh fish might be a better option for improving cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
Therefore, it’s best to consult a doctor before taking fish oil if you have high cholesterol levels.

You can take fish oil every day. However, taking high doses of fish oil (at least 900 mg of EPA plus 600 mg DHA) over time  may promote  immune system suppression because of the powerful anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 fats.
It’s important to check the dosages of EPA and DHA in your fish oil before you purchase so that you don’t buy one that could lead to this effect.
Most health organizations recommend consuming  250 to 500 mg  of combined EPA and DHA per day, with slight variations depending on your age and health status.
For ALA, the daily recommended intake is  1.1 g per day  for women and 1.6 g per day for men.

Fish oil supplements that combine omega-3 fatty acids with other ingredients, like CoQ10 or vitamin D, can be a great choice to help support brain function.
Nordic Naturals Cod Liver Oil  contains vitamin D, while  Thorne’s Omega-3  contains CoQ10.
A  2023 study  found that higher blood levels of CoQ10 could be linked to improved cognitive function.
Meanwhile, a 12-month  study from 2020  involving older adults showed that vitamin D supplementation could enhance brain function by reducing oxidative stress.

In addition to providing omega-3 fatty acids, some types of fish oil (like cod liver oil) may also contain other nutrients like vitamins A and D. This may be appealing if you’re taking these vitamins separately and looking for a simple way to streamline your supplement routine.
But while fish oil is one type of omega-3 supplement, there are several other varieties that may be a better fit, depending on your preferences.
For example, a plant-based omega-3 supplement might be a better option for those who prefer to avoid fish. In fact, research suggests that algae-based omega-3 supplements  may be as effective  at increasing levels of DHA as fish oil.

HUM Nutrition OMG! Omega-3 Softgels  is one of the best fish oil supplements for maintaining healthy vision, as it provides 1,400 mg of omega-3s and 13.4 mg of vitamin E per serving.
A  2015 study  found that vitamin E supplementation could be linked to a lower risk of cataracts. On the other hand, a  2021 review  notes that further research is needed on the benefits of vitamin E for cataract and glaucoma.

If you have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), consider opting for a fish oil supplement that pairs omega-3s with CoQ10.
Thorne Omega-3 with CoQ10 , for example, provides 630 mg of combined EPA and DHA with 30 mg of CoQ10, making it one of the best omega-3 supplements for PCOS on our list.
Research from 2022  suggests that CoQ10 may be beneficial for the treatment of PCOS by improving insulin resistance, balancing hormone levels, and improving lipid levels.

The bottom line
There are many types of fish oil supplements, each from a different source and with varying amounts of omega-3 fatty acids.
When shopping for an omega-3 supplement, it’s best to choose a product that’s been third-party tested to make sure the contents match the label and supplement facts panel.
You’ll also want to consider which form of supplement you prefer, such as a liquid, capsule, or gummy, and your preferred dose. However, keep in mind that more is not always better. In fact,  excessive intake  may do more harm than good.
For best results, try taking the supplement alongside a  balanced diet  to help maximize its potential benefits.
