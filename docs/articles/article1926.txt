Consider the source.  Check the author’s credentials and look for books written by experts in their fields. For instance, prioritize material from dietitians, physicians, or personal trainers whenever possible.
Be wary of outlandish health claims.  Steer clear of books that make exaggerated claims that seem too good to be true. Instead, look for authors who back up their statements with studies and references from credible sources.
Look for realistic approaches to nutrition.  We recommend avoiding books that promote fad diets, unhealthy habits, or overly restrictive eating patterns. Instead, look for books with a more realistic and sustainable approach to  healthy eating .
Read customer reviews.  Customer reviews can provide insights to help you decide before you buy. Reading reviews is also a great way to assess whether a book is a good fit for your level of nutrition knowledge.
