Title: Is Octopus Healthy? Here’s What A Dietitian Says

A dietitian explores the health benefits, downsides, and nutritional value of eating octopus.
The octopus is a type of cephalopod that lives in the ocean.
It’s well-known for having eight legs and being one of the most intelligent creatures in the sea ( 1 ,  2 ).
Octopus is also a culinary delicacy in coastal areas of the world. It’s a beloved food of many people in Asia-Pacific countries like Japan and the Koreas as well as in the Mediterranean, such as Italy and Spain.
If you’ve eaten octopus before or wondered what it might be like, but you’re unsure about how healthy the seafood actually is, this article is for you.
Here, we’ll take a deeper dive into the nutritional profile of octopus, including its benefits, downsides, and more.

Types of octopus
Like many types of seafood, octopus is versatile. The most common forms of octopus used for meals are:
fresh
frozen
canned
dried
Octopus can be eaten raw or cooked.
The most common ways to cook octopus are:
grilling
baking
steaming
boiling
poaching
stewing
frying
Depending on the type of octopus you’re cooking with, and how you decide to cook it, octopus can take on completely different flavor and texture profiles.
For example, some people have a hard time eating octopus because of its chewy texture.
To achieve a less-rubbery texture, many chefs swear by using frozen octopus or by slow-poaching fresh octopus in a flavorful liquid at a low temperature for at least 90 minutes.
Dried octopus usually requires a similar amount of time for rehydrating and cooking, but you may not always have time for such a lengthy process.
In that case, canned octopus can easily be eaten right away and served plain — or you can quickly spice it up with garlic,  herbs and spices , citrus juices, and similar seasonings.
Fresh octopus is commonly used in meals, but frozen, dried, and canned varieties are also available. There are many different ways to cook octopus, and some people prefer to eat it raw.

Nutritional profile of octopus
Overall, octopus is a healthy source of lean protein that is low in calories, fat, and carbohydrates but high in  amino acids  (and thus protein), trace minerals, and micronutrients like vitamins ( 2 ,  3 ).
Here is the nutrition profile for 3 ounces (85 grams) of octopus cooked using a moist-heat cooking method like boiling, braising, or stewing ( 4 ):
Calories:  139
Carbs:  4 grams
Protein:  25 grams
Fiber:  0 grams
Fat:  2 grams
Vitamin B12 :  1,275% of the Daily Value (DV)
Selenium:  139% of the DV
Copper:  70% of the DV
Iron:  45% of the DV
Vitamin B6:  32% of the DV
Zinc:  26% of the DV
Niacin:  20% of the DV
Phosphorus:  19% of the DV
Sodium:  17% of the DV
Pantothenic acid:  15% of the DV
Choline:  13% of the DV
Magnesium :  12% of the DV
Potassium:  11% of the DV
Just as the preparation method you choose for octopus can alter the taste and texture of the final dish, it might also influence the food’s final nutritional value ( 3 ).
For example, a 3-ounce (45-gram) serving of dried octopus could contain as much as 1,114 mg of salt — 289% more than fresh cooked octopus ( 5 ).
What’s more, canned octopus is usually packed in oil and therefore higher in fat ( 6 ).
If octopus has been deep-fried, it will also be higher in fat and calories than when the seafood is roasted, grilled, poached, or stewed.
Nonetheless, octopus prepared any way is an incredibly rich source of many nutrients, such as vitamin B12 and  selenium , which are important for bodily functions like forming red blood cells, synthesizing DNA, and combating harmful oxidation ( 7 ,  8 ).
Though it’s not quite as rich in unsaturated fats as fatty fish like salmon and tuna, octopus is still high in the  omega-3s  docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ( 2 ,  4 ,  9 ,  10 ).
They’re considered heart-healthy nutrients because they may help reduce inflammation and protect against heart disease ( 2 ,  4 ,  9 ,  10 ).
Octopus is an incredibly nutritious lean source of protein. The seafood is low in calories and fat, yet it’s full of vitamins B6 and B12, selenium, copper, iron, zinc, and more.

The evidence-based health benefits of eating octopus
Octopus plays a crucial role in many cultural and culinary traditions.
Not only does the seafood make for a delicious meal to many, but octopus can undoubtedly be a part of a nutritious and well-balanced diet.
Here are a few of the most impressive health benefits of octopus.
“Lean” proteins are good sources of protein that remain relatively low in calories, fat, and cholesterol.
Packing more than 25 grams of protein per serving for just under 140 calories, octopus definitely fits the description of a  lean protein .
Though octopus does contain a decent amount of cholesterol — about 82 mg per serving — it still contains less than squid and shrimp ( 4 ,  11 ,  12 ).
Plus, research on dietary cholesterol and heart disease has begun to shift. Contrary to what was once believed, it seems eating nutritious sources of cholesterol like  eggs  and seafood is less likely to raise blood cholesterol levels than eating foods like red meat that are high in saturated fat ( 13 ,  14 ).
In turns out that a diet high in lean seafood — even if it contains some cholesterol — may actually improve heart health rather than harm it ( 15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18 ).
The healthy unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids in octopus may help prevent heart disease, but their benefits don’t stop there ( 9 ,  19 ,  20 ).
A diet rich in sources of omega-3s — like octopus and other types of fish — has also been linked with a lower risk for some cancers, protection of cognitive function, and a healthy  gut microbiome  ( 21 ,  22 ,  23 ,  24 ).
The  gut microbiome  refers to the groups of healthy bacteria that live in our intestines. The microbiome plays a vital role in immunity, inflammation, and disease prevention.
Another interesting property of the omega-3s in octopus and seafood: eating more of them may  reduce symptoms of major depressive disorder .
In certain populations, research shows those who eat moderate — but not necessarily high — amounts of seafood tend to score lower on measures of depression. What’s more, it appears the ratio between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids in the blood is also a factor ( 25 ,  26 ,  27 ).
Though a diet rich in omega-3s from seafood has been linked with reduced depression, there is not yet enough evidence to conclude that omega-3 supplements effectively treat people already living with depression ( 28 ).
Interestingly enough, it’s not just the omega-3s in octopus that account for its  potential antidepressant properties .
One study analyzed foods and their concentrations of 12 different antidepressant nutrients, including omega-3s as well as vitamin B12, selenium, iron, zinc, and more. Octopus ranked sixth on the list of top antidepressant foods ( 29 ).
Octopus is a lean source of seafood that is low in calories and fat but rich in protein and other nutrients that may help support heart health, mental health, the gut microbiome, and more.

Potential downsides of eating octopus
It’s evident that octopus is a nutrient-dense source of protein that has been an integral part of nutritious diets for ages.
Nonetheless, some people need to avoid octopus due to allergies. In fact, shellfish are one of the  most common allergenic foods  ( 30 ,  31 ,  32 ,  33 ).
Other people choose to avoid eating octopus for  ethical reasons . Some are concerned with the sustainability of how octopus is caught or farmed, while others worry about the ethics of killing and eating octopus — especially since it’s believed to be an incredibly intelligent animal.
Aside from these important conversations, there are also a couple of health considerations to keep in mind if you eat octopus regularly.
One serving of octopus could contain as much as 25% of the DV for  salt , and that’s without adding any additional salt during the cooking process ( 3 ).
For some people, this may not be much to worry about. However, for those who are salt-sensitive, it could adversely affect your blood pressure and  raise your risk of heart disease  ( 34 ).
One common way to prepare octopus is to deep-fry it.
Though many enjoy the taste and texture,  fried foods  are linked with negative health outcomes, including high blood pressure, heart disease, depression, diabetes, and more ( 35 ,  36 ,  37 ,  38 ).
Like most types of seafood, there’s a chance octopus could be contaminated with heavy metals like  mercury  and arsenic ( 39 ,  40 ,  41 ).
Some research suggests that the metals often concentrate in the digestive glands of the sea creature, so avoiding those tissues is one way to try and limit your exposure when eating octopus ( 42 ).
Researchers have also observed  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  (PAHs) — a class of carcinogenic pollutants — in octopus, though to varying degrees depending on where the octopuses lived ( 43 ).
Those who are particularly at risk to the effects of mercury exposure, such as pregnant and breastfeeding people, small children, and people who eat a lot of seafood, may want to use extra caution and find sources of octopus less likely to be contaminated ( 44 ,  45 ).

Overall, octopus is a nutritious food. However, it’s higher in salt than many other proteins, and there is a chance it could be contaminated with heavy metals. To get the most nutrition from the seafood, seek sustainable sources and avoid deep-fried varieties.

The bottom line
Octopus is a healthy food that is extremely rich in many nutrients known to support optimal human health.
If you decide to incorporate octopus into your diet on a regular basis, keep in mind that it is higher in salt than many other types of animal protein.
Plus, it carries a risk of being contaminated with heavy metals from pollution in the ocean.
Nevertheless, when consumed in moderation using nutritious cooking methods and as part of a well-rounded diet, octopus may have benefits like reducing the risk of heart disease and symptoms of depression.
