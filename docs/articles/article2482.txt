Title: 14 Healthy Foods That Are High in Potassium

Many fruits and vegetables are high in potassium. This can include beans and sweet potatoes.
Potassium is an essential mineral that the body requires for a variety of processes. Since the body can’t produce potassium, it has to come from food.
However, the majority of Americans don’t get enough potassium from their diets.
This is mainly due to a lack of fruits and vegetables in the typical Western diet ( 1 ).
In the United States, it’s recommended that healthy adults consume 4,700 mg daily ( 2 ).
Getting enough dietary potassium is essential for bone and heart health. It’s vital for people with high blood pressure, and it may decrease heart disease and stroke risk ( 1 ).
This article lists 14 of the foods highest in potassium.
