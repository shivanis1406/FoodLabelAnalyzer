Title: Water Fasting: Benefits and Dangers

Water fasting may offer several health benefits, including weight loss and a reduced risk of some chronic conditions. However, it is also associated with several risks and may not be suitable for everyone.
Fasting, a method of restricting food intake, has been practiced for thousands of years.
Water fasting is a type of fast that restricts everything except water. It has become more popular in recent years as a quick way to lose weight.
Studies have shown that water fasting could have health benefits. For example, it may lower the risk of some  chronic diseases  and stimulate  autophagy , a process that helps your body break down and recycle old parts of your cells.
That said, human studies on water fasting are very limited. Moreover, it comes with many health risks and is not suitable for everyone.
This article gives you an overview of water fasting and how it works, as well as its benefits and dangers.

What is water fasting?
Water fasting is a type of fast during which you cannot consume anything besides  water .
Most water fasts last 24–72 hours. You should not follow a water fast for longer than this without medical supervision.
Here are a few reasons why people try water fasting:
religious or spiritual reasons
to lose weight
for “ detoxing ”
for its health benefits
preparing for a medical procedure
The main reason why people try water fasting is to improve their health.
In fact, several  studies  have linked water fasting with some impressive  health benefits , including a lower risk of certain cancers, heart disease, and diabetes.
Water fasting may also  promote autophagy , a process in which your body breaks down and recycles old, potentially dangerous parts of your cells.
Popular diets like the lemon  detox cleanse  are modeled after the water fast. The  lemon detox cleanse  only lets you drink a mixture of lemon juice, water, maple syrup, and cayenne pepper several times per day for up to 7 days.
However, water fasting has many risks and can be very dangerous if followed for too long.
Water fasting is a type of fast during which you’re not allowed to consume anything except water. It’s linked with a lower risk of chronic disease and autophagy, but it also comes with many risks.

How do you water fast?
There are no scientific guidelines on how to start water fasting.
However, several groups of people should not water fast without medical supervision.
This includes people with gout, diabetes (both types 1 and 2), and  eating disorders, older adults, people who are pregnant, and children .
If you have never water fasted before, it’s a good idea to spend 3–4 days preparing your body for being without food.
You can do this by eating smaller portions at each meal or by fasting for part of the day.
During a water fast, you are not allowed to eat or drink anything besides water.
Most people  drink two to three liters  of water per day during a water fast.
The water fast lasts for 24–72 hours. You should not water fast for longer than this without medical supervision because of health risks.
Some people may feel weak or dizzy during a water fast and may want to avoid operating heavy machinery and driving to avoid causing an accident.
After the water fast, you should resist the urge to eat a big meal.
This is because eating a large meal after a fast may cause uncomfortable symptoms.
Instead, break your fast with a smoothie or smaller meals. You can start introducing larger meals throughout the day as you feel more comfortable.
The post-fast phase is especially important after longer fasts. This is because you may be at  risk of refeeding syndrome , a potentially fatal condition in which the body undergoes rapid changes in fluid and electrolyte levels.
This phase normally lasts a day, but people who fast for 3 or more days may need up to 3 days before they feel comfortable eating larger meals.
A water fast usually lasts 24–72 hours and is followed by a post-fast phase. If you’re new to water fasting, you might want to spend 3–4 days preparing your body to be without food by reducing your portion sizes or fasting for part of the day.

Potential benefits of water fasting
Both human and animal studies have linked water fasting to a variety of health benefits.
Here are a few health benefits of water fasting.
Autophagy  is a process in which old parts of your cells are broken down and recycled.
Several animal studies suggest that autophagy may help protect against diseases like  cancer ,  Alzheimer’s , and  heart disease .
For example, autophagy may prevent damaged parts of your cells from accumulating, which is a risk factor for many cancers. This may help prevent cancer cells from growing.
Animal studies  have consistently found that water fasting helps promote autophagy.  Animal studies  also show that autophagy may help extend life span.
That said, there are very few human studies on water fasting, autophagy, and disease prevention. More research is needed before recommending it to promote autophagy.
Research shows that longer, medically supervised water fasts may help people with high blood pressure lower their  blood pressure .
One study  in 48 people with overweight or obesity found that water fasting for an average of 17 days under medical supervision led to reductions in systolic blood pressure.
It was also associated with improvements in levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and inflammation.
Similarly, another  review  concluded that water fasting could significantly reduce blood pressure levels and body weight in people with high blood pressure.
Still, more research is needed to evaluate the link between short-term water fasts (24–72 hours) and blood pressure.
Insulin  and  leptin  are important hormones that affect the body’s metabolism.  Insulin  helps the body store nutrients from the bloodstream, while leptin helps the body feel full.
Research shows that water fasting could make your body more sensitive to  leptin  and  insulin . Greater sensitivity makes these hormones more effective.
For example, being more  insulin sensitive  means your body is more efficient at reducing its blood sugar levels. Meanwhile,  being more leptin sensitive  could help your body process hunger signals more efficiently, and in turn, lower the risk of obesity.
There is some evidence that water fasting may lower the risk factors of  chronic diseases  like diabetes, cancer, and heart disease.
In one  2013 study , 30 healthy adults followed a water fast for 24 hours. After the fast, they had significantly lower blood  levels of triglycerides  — a risk factor for heart disease.
Some  research  also suggests that water fasting may protect the heart against damage from free radicals.
Free radicals are unstable molecules that can damage parts of cells. They are known to play a role in many chronic diseases.
Moreover,  studies  in animals and humans have found that water fasting may suppress genes that help cancer cells grow. It may also improve the effects of chemotherapy.
Keep in mind, only a handful of studies have analyzed the effects of water fasting in humans. More research in humans is needed before making recommendations.
Research shows that water fasting may lower the risk of many chronic diseases and promote autophagy. However, most research is from animal or short-term studies. More studies are needed before recommending it.

Dangers and risks of water fasting
Although water fasting may have some benefits, it comes with health risks.
Here are a few dangers and risks of water fasting.
Because a water fast restricts calories, you will likely  lose a lot of weight quickly .
Unfortunately, a lot of the weight you lose in the beginning may come from water, carbs, and even a  small amount of muscle mass .
Although it sounds strange, a water fast could make you  dehydrated . This is because roughly 20–30% of your daily water intake comes from the foods you eat.
If you’re drinking the same amount of water but not eating foods, you might not be  getting enough water .
Symptoms of dehydration include dizziness, nausea, headaches, constipation, low blood pressure, and low productivity. To avoid dehydration, you may need to drink more than usual.
Dehydration caused by water fasting can lead to  orthostatic hypotension .
Orthostatic hypotention  is defined as a drop in blood pressure that happens when you suddenly stand up, and it can leave you dizzy, lightheaded, and at risk of fainting.
If you experience  orthostatic hypotension  while fasting, you may need to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery. The dizziness and risk of fainting could lead to an accident.
If you experience these symptoms during a water fast, this type of fasting may not be a good option for you.
Although a water fast is relatively short, there are a few conditions that may be aggravated by water fasting.
People with the following medical conditions should not water fast without first seeking advice from a healthcare professional:
Gout:  Water fasting may increase  uric acid  production, a risk factor for gout attacks.
Eating disorders:  There is  evidence  that fasting may encourage disordered eating behaviors for some people.
Although water fasting may have some health benefits, it comes with many risks and dangers. For example, water fasting could make you prone to muscle loss, dehydration, blood pressure changes, and a variety of other health conditions.

Will water fasting help you lose weight?
Like other types of fasting, water fasting can help you lose weight.
However, it comes with plenty of health risks.
If you want to reap the benefits of fasting but also want to lose weight,  intermittent fasting  and  alternate-day fasting  are probably more effective approaches than water fasting for 24–72 hours.
These fasts provide similar health benefits but can be followed for much longer periods, as they allow you to eat food, decreasing the risk of  nutrient deficiencies .
A water fast can help you lose weight, but other types of fasting can offer you the benefits of fasting and weight loss with fewer risks.

The bottom line
Water fasting is a popular method of fasting that may have some health benefits.
However, most of the health benefits of water fasting have been observed in animal studies, and the same effects might not apply to humans.
Water fasting also comes with several risks, especially if you fast for longer than 3 days or have medical conditions like gout or diabetes.
If you want the health benefits of fasting, try safer methods like intermittent fasting or alternate-day fasting. These fasts allow you to eat some food, making them easier to follow long term.
