This article covers 10 of the best Smoothie King smoothies to help you find an option that fits your needs and preferences.

Best for weight loss
Smoothie King offers a selection of  low calorie  blends in their “Stay Slim” line, including the Lean1 Vanilla, which features ingredients like bananas, almonds, and Lean1 Vanilla Protein.
With 240 calories, 21  grams of protein , and 4 grams of fiber per 20-ounce (590-mL) serving, it can be a good choice if you’re trying to lose weight ( 1 ).
Reducing your appetite and supporting your weight loss, fiber and protein can help keep you feeling full between meals ( 2 ,  3 ).

Best for workouts
This classic menu item provides a good mix of carbs and protein, making it a great smoothie to sip on after you hit the gym.
It contains 340 calories, 35 grams of carbs, 27 grams of protein, and 5 grams of  fiber  in each 20-ounce (590-mL) serving and is made with bananas, almonds, whey protein, and a dairy whey blend ( 4 ).
Studies show that pairing whey protein with resistance training can increase your muscle mass and  improve your posture  ( 5 ,  6 ).

Best green smoothie
Featuring a blend of bananas, pineapples, almonds, carrots, spinach, and plant-based protein, the Vegan Pineapple Spinach smoothie is equal parts nutritious and delicious.
It contains 320 calories, 11 grams of protein, and 8 grams of fiber per 20-ounce (590-mL) serving ( 7 ).
Though it also contains 41 grams of sugar and 65 grams of carbs, this smoothie can be altered if you remove the apple pineapple juice blend. Try swapping in almond milk or coconut water instead to reduce the amount of sugar.

Best meal replacement
This hearty smoothie provides you a healthy  dose of protein , carbs, and heart-healthy fats, making it a good choice if you’re on the go and looking for a quick and easy meal replacement.
In fact, a 20-ounce (590-mL) serving contains 520 calories, 26  grams of fat , 19 grams of protein, 60 grams of carbs, and 7 grams of fiber ( 8 ).
It’s made with bananas, almond milk, protein powder, peanut butter, cocoa, and an apple juice blend. It also includes Smoothie King’s signature Super Grains Enhancer, which features nutritious ingredients like chia seeds.
Chia seeds have been linked to a long list of benefits and can be a great addition to your diet, thanks to their content of fiber, protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants ( 9 ).

Best vegan
The Vegan Mango Kale smoothie contains a blend of nutritious, vegan-friendly ingredients — including bananas, kale, mangoes, almonds, apple and pineapple juice, and plant-based protein.
It packs quite a punch when it comes to nutrition, with 340 calories, 11 grams of protein, and 6 grams of fiber in a 20-ounce (590-mL) smoothie ( 10 ).
Though it is relatively high in carbs, it’s  free of added sugar . You can also opt to reduce the carb content by swapping the fruit juice for lower carb, plant-based alternatives, like almond milk.

Best low fat
There are a variety of low fat selections on the menu at Smoothie King, including Slim-N-Trim Blueberry, which contains  wild blueberries , an apple blueberry juice blend, stevia, and a mix of several protein powders.
It contains just 2 grams of fat, including 250 calories and 11 grams of protein per 20-ounce (590-mL) serving ( 11 ).
What’s more, it provides 5 grams of fiber, a key nutrient that can support healthy cholesterol levels, increase  feelings of fullness , and boost the health of your gut microbiome ( 12 ).

Best gluten-free
Many of the smoothies from Smoothie King are made without  gluten , so they can be included on a gluten-free diet, such as the Lean1 Strawberry.
It’s very nutritious, containing 200 calories, 19 grams of protein, and 5 grams of fiber per 20-ounce (590-mL) serving ( 13 ).
It is also made using just three simple ingredients, including strawberries, stevia, and Lean1 Vanilla Protein, which is gluten-free.
However, note that none of the smoothies from Smoothie King are certified gluten-free and cross-contamination is possible. Therefore, they may not be suitable for  people with celiac disease  or those who are sensitive to even trace amounts of gluten.

Best low carb
Whether you’re following a ketogenic diet or simply trying to cut back on carbs, the Gladiator Vanilla Smoothie is definitely worth a try.
It’s one of the  lowest carb  items on their menu, containing just 3 grams of carbs, 3.5 grams of fat, 230 calories, and 45 grams of protein in a 20-ounce (590-mL) serving ( 14 ).
It’s made with Gladiator Protein Vanilla, but you can also add two ingredients of your choice.
Consider adding peanut butter to boost the  fat content  or veggies like spinach, carrots, or kale to increase the nutritional value while keeping the carb count low.

Best for paleo
This tasty green smoothie is made with spinach, mango, almonds, and bananas — all of which can easily fit into a paleo diet.
It also contains FITAID + Paleo Protein Enhancer, which is used to bump up the amount of protein,  B vitamins , and vitamins C and E in your smoothie ( 15 ).
A 20-ounce (590-mL) serving provides 400 calories, 29 grams of protein, and 9 grams of fiber. It also contains 41 mg of caffeine to  increase your energy levels  ( 16 ).

Best for allergies
Not only does Smoothie King lists all potential allergens for each item on their menu, but they also allow you to customize your order. This proves useful for people with food allergies.
The Veggie Lemon Ginger is free of major allergens and is made from mangoes, pineapples, stevia, spinach, carrots, kale, ginger, and a blend of juices — including white grape lemon juice and papaya juice.
It provides 310 calories, 4 grams of protein, and 6 grams of fiber in a 20-ounce (590-mL) serving. It also contains 80 grams of carbs, though this can be lowered by removing some of the juice ( 17 ).
Keep in mind that all Smoothie King smoothies are made using the same shared equipment, so they may not be suitable for people with severe food allergies or intolerances. If you’re highly sensitive to allergens, you may want to be more cautious.
