Title: Is Apple Cider Vinegar Keto-Friendly?

Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is a pungent, acidic, and slightly fruity vinegar made from apple juice.
It’s widely used in cooking but has also earned a reputation as a  home remedy  for a variety of ailments. Many people also use ACV for weight loss, as some research suggests that vinegar may help reduce your appetite and regulate your blood sugar levels ( 1 ).
If you’re following the low carb, high fat keto diet, you may be particularly interested in ACV as a supplement or ingredient in your cooking.
Still, you may want to know whether it’s suitable for keto.
This article reviews ACV’s carb content to determine whether it’s keto-friendly.

How many carbs does apple cider vinegar contain?
Just 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of apple cider vinegar provides ( 2 ):
Calories:  0 grams
Protein:  0 grams
Fat:  0 grams
Total carbs:  1 gram
Fiber:  0 grams
Net carbs:  1 gram
Apple cider vinegar may also contain trace amounts of fiber from the apple juice that it’s made from, though not enough to have any effect on your body — especially since ACV should only be  consumed in small amounts .
As such, ACV has just 1 gram of total and net carbs.
Keep in mind that  net carbs  are calculated by subtracting the grams of fiber from the total carbs.
Most major brands of ACV, including Bragg’s and Heinz, list 0 grams of total and net carbs on their food labels ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
Therefore, it’s important to look at the nutrient label of any product you intend to buy, as some brands may have fewer carbs than others.
ACV provides 1 gram of net and total carbs in a 1-tablespoon (15-mL) serving. It has no fat, calories, or protein.

Can you take apple cider vinegar on the keto diet?
At just 1 gram of carbs per 1-tablespoon (15-mL) serving, ACV is definitely doable on keto as a light garnish or occasional dressing.
However, many people on keto  limit their daily carb intake  to 50 grams of total carbs or 25 grams of net carbs. Thus, ACV not be the best way to spend your carb allotment since it provides negligible calories ( 6 ).
What’s more, some other vinegars — including white vinegar and rice vinegar — are completely carb-free and may be a better fit. They won’t add extra carbs to marinades, salad dressings, or any other recipes that call for vinegar ( 7 ,  8 ).
Remember to check the nutrient label on your ACV to confirm its carb count.
If you are using ACV to boost weight loss on keto due to its potential to suppress appetite, you may also want to consider supplementing with medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil. Studies suggest that it may help you  stay full  and eat less ( 9 ).
MCT oil  is carb-free but packs 120 calories per tablespoon (15 mL) since it’s 100% fat ( 10 ).
Additionally, it’s safe to take ACV  as a supplement  on the keto diet. You’ll just need to mind how these supplements fit into your carb allotment.
ACV contains minimal carbs, making it keto-friendly. Nonetheless, white vinegar and rice vinegar are carb-free alternatives that may be even better.

Are there any safety concerns with taking apple cider vinegar on keto?
ACV and other vinegars are extremely acidic. Supplemental doses have caused severe cases of  tooth erosion  and esophagus damage ( 11 ,  12 ).
As such, it’s important to limit your ACV intake and dilute it well.
ACV doses greater than 2 tablespoons (30 mL) daily haven’t been widely studied, so it’s best to stick to this amount or less per day.
When you take it as a supplement, make sure that each tablespoon (15 mL) is diluted in at least 1 cup (240 ml) of water so that it’s not as powerfully acidic ( 1 ).
Additionally, you may want to drink your diluted ACV with a straw to keep it from coming into direct contact with your teeth.
Note that ACV mixed into  salad dressings  or used in cooking doesn’t harm your teeth.
ACV is very acidic and may corrode your teeth if not properly diluted. Be sure to limit your intake to 2 tablespoons (30 mL) or less per day, and dilute it in water.

The bottom line
ACV is a flavorful vinegar for salad dressings and marinades. At just 1 gram of carbs per tablespoon (15 mL), it’s perfectly  keto-friendly .
Still, white vinegar and rice vinegar work just as well in the kitchen and are carb-free. Thus, you may want to consider other vinegars instead.
Nonetheless, ACV’s carb count may vary by brand, so be sure to read the nutrient label.
If you take  ACV  as a supplement, be sure to limit your intake and dilute it to prevent damage to your teeth and digestive tract.
