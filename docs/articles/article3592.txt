Title: Ways to Lower Cholesterol With Your Diet

High cholesterol increases your risk of cardiovascular conditions like heart disease and stroke. A diet low in saturated fats and high in soluble fiber can help manage your cholesterol levels.
Your diet plays an important role in your cholesterols levels. Here are some foods to limit and include to help manage your cholesterol.

What is cholesterol?
Cholesterol is a waxy substance your body needs to make a variety of important substances, like vitamin D and certain hormones.
Your body produces all the cholesterol you need, but the food you eat can also impact cholesterol levels.
There are two types of cholesterol: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).
LDL cholesterol is often referred to as “bad” because it can build up in your arteries, increasing your risk of heart disease.
HDL cholesterol is considered “good” because it helps move cholesterol from your blood to your liver, where it is eliminated from your body.
Finding ways to lower your LDL cholesterol can be important if your levels are high. However, it’s also important to make sure your cholesterol levels are within a  healthy range .

Foods to limit
A diet high in certain foods can raise your LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels.
High LDL cholesterol increases your risk of cardiovascular conditions like heart attack and stroke.
Saturated fats are the  main dietary cause  of high LDL cholesterol.
Foods high in saturated fats include:
red meats like beef, lamb, and pork
chicken and poultry skin
full-fat dairy foods like butter, cheese, and cream
oils like coconut and palm
some fried foods
It’s important to note that while coconut oil is high in saturated fat, most of this is in the form of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs). Because they are absorbed differently,  current evidence  is mixed about whether MCTs contribute to high cholesterol levels.
Foods high in saturated fat also tend to be high in dietary cholesterol. While it was previously thought that dietary cholesterol increased cholesterol levels,  new research  no longer supports this connection.
The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends limiting saturated fats to  less than 6%  of your daily calories.
Low to moderate alcohol intake  may have  a protective effect against cardiovascular disease by increasing HDL (“good”) cholesterol levels.
However, high alcohol intake is linked to lower HDL levels and other risk factors, like high blood pressure and  triglycerides , a type of fat in your blood.
Limiting your alcohol intake can help lower your blood cholesterol levels. The  AHA recommends  no more than 1 to 2 drinks per day for males and no more than 1 drink per day for females.

Foods to include
Foods containing soluble fiber and healthy fats may help you manage your cholesterol.
Soluble fiber is found in plant foods like cereal grains, fruits, and vegetables. It absorbs water as it moves through your digestive system and forms a gel.
As it passes through your intestines, soluble fiber  prevents your body  from absorbing some fat and cholesterol, helping to manage cholesterol levels.
Foods  high in soluble fiber  include:
fruits like apples, bananas, citrus, and berries
beans, including black, pinto, and kidney
cereal grains, like  oats  and barley
legumes, like lentils and peas
brussels sprouts
avocados
Insoluble fiber is another type of  dietary fiber . This type passes through your digestive system undissolved and helps your colon function properly. While most plant foods contain both types of fiber, foods higher in insoluble fiber include whole grains, beans, and other legumes.
Omega-3s are a type of unsaturated fat mainly found in seafood and plant sources.
Research shows  there is a link between eating foods high in omega-3s and lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels.
Eating  fish  containing omega-3s at least twice a week may help  manage your cholesterol  levels.
Food sources of omega-3s include:
fatty fish, like  salmon , tuna, sardines, and mackerel
nuts and seed like  walnuts ,  flaxseeds , and chia seeds
vegetables oils like canola and soybean

Cholesterol-lowering supplements
Aside from focusing on a diet higher in soluble fiber and low in saturated fat, some herbs and supplements may also benefit cholesterol levels.
Stanols and sterols are compounds that occur naturally in plants. Similar to soluble fiber, they  help lower cholesterol  by preventing it from being absorbed in your digestive tract.
Consuming plant-based foods may not provide enough of these compounds to significantly affect your cholesterol levels.
However, they  occur in higher amounts  in soybean oil, stanol and sterol supplements, and foods with added stanols and sterols, like fortified orange juice and spreads.
Flaxseeds contain omega-3s, soluble fiber, and  polyphenols , a compound found in plants that can help lower cholesterol.
Supplements containing whole flaxseeds or flaxseed lignans (a type of polyphenol)  may help  lower cholesterol levels.
Drinking  green tea  may help lower your cholesterol.
A  2020 review of studies  found that compounds in green tea called catechins significantly lowered LDL and total cholesterol levels.

The bottom line
High cholesterol increases your risk of cardiovascular disease.
Although your body makes all the cholesterol you need, your diet can also affect cholesterol levels.
You can help lower your cholesterol by eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, foods higher in omega-3s and unsaturated fats, and certain cholesterol-lowering supplements.
