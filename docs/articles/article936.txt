Title: 25 Healthy Foods You Can Buy at Walmart

When you’re trying to save money on grocery shopping, big-box stores like Walmart have a lot of appeal. These stores often offer a wide variety of foods at very low prices.
That said, Walmart often gets a bad rap for selling a lot of ultra-processed foods.
While the company does sell these foods, it also stocks a wide variety of nutritious, whole foods, which are generally at discounted prices when purchased in bulk.
Here are 25 nutritious, budget-friendly foods you can buy at Walmart.

1–4. Dried fruits
To kick things off, let’s look at some of the dried fruits available on Walmart shelves.
Dried fruits have a much longer shelf life than fresh fruit. They’re also a nutrition powerhouse because their nutrients are concentrated during the drying process ( 1 ).
However, drying concentrates sugars too ( 2 ).
Though the sugars contained in dried fruits are usually naturally occurring, the calories can add up quickly. Thus, you may want to be mindful of portion sizes when eating dried fruit.
Raisins , which come from grapes, are one of the most popular dried fruits.
They make an excellent addition to many dishes, such as rice pudding and certain  salads , though they’re a tasty snack on their own.
One small box (43 grams) of raisins contains ( 3 ):
Calories:  129
Protein:  1.5 grams
Carbs:  34 grams
Fat:  less than 1 gram
Fiber:  2 grams
Potassium:  7% of the Daily Value (DV)
Prunes, or  dried plums , can be eaten on their own or used in dishes like jams, cookies, and cakes.
This dried fruit is a well-known remedy for  mild constipation , as it’s a good source of fiber to keep your bowels moving ( 4 ).
A high fiber diet promotes bowel regularity by increasing stool bulk and frequency ( 5 ).
Just 5 prunes (40 grams) provide ( 6 ):
Calories:  100
Carbs:  26 grams
Protein:  1 gram
Fat:  less than 1 gram
Fiber:  3 grams
Potassium:  6% of the DV
Apples are a nutritious snack, and when they’re dried they’re even easier to take on the go.
Plus, dried apples make a great addition to trail mix.
Four ounces (40 grams) of dried apples contain ( 7 ):
Calories:  120
Carbs:  29 grams
Protein:  less than 1 gram
Fat:  less than 1 gram
Fiber:  3 grams
Berries  are an antioxidant-rich fruit that make a great snack. However, they tend to spoil quite quickly, so drying them helps them keep longer.
You can eat dried berries on their own or add them to oatmeal,  yogurt , or baked goods.
Just 1.5 ounces (40 grams) of dried mixed berries offers ( 8 ):
Calories:  140
Carbs:  34 grams
Protein:  1 gram
Fat:  less than 1 gram
Fiber:  2 grams

5–6. Nuts
Nuts are a concentrated source of healthy fats that have numerous functions in your body, including providing energy, protecting your organs, aiding in cell growth, and promoting nutrient absorption ( 9 ,  10 ).
Fats from  nuts  may also reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke by promoting healthy arteries and cholesterol levels ( 11 ,  12 ).
Therefore, eating various types of nuts and nut butters is a great way to promote  heart health .
When shopping for nuts or nut butters at Walmart, keep an eye on added sodium, oils, and sugars, as these ingredients are commonly added during processing.
Some people may experience elevated blood pressure when consuming too much sodium, whereas added sugars and oils can quickly boost calorie content, potentially leading to weight gain ( 13 ,  14 ).
Select raw or lightly salted nuts to avoid excess sodium, and look for a “no sugar added” label on nut butters.
You can eat  almonds  on their own or slice them up to add to granola, yogurt, cakes, cookies, and other baked goods.
Almond butter  is made by grinding these nuts, often with a sweetener added. You can spread it on toast or add it to smoothies, oatmeal, and baked goods.
Though almonds can be pricey, buying them in bulk at Walmart cuts the cost significantly.
Still, look at the sugar content before purchasing, as some versions contain high amounts of added sugars.
Just 1 ounce (28 grams) of almonds provides ( 15 ):
Calories:  164
Carbs:  6 grams
Protein:  6 grams
Fat:  14 grams

Fiber:  3 grams
Sodium:  227 mg
Calcium:  9% of the DV
Magnesium:  21% of the DV
Potassium:  5% of the DV
While peanuts are technically legumes, they’re often eaten and prepared as nuts.
Peanuts  are an excellent source of healthy monounsaturated fats. When ground or made into peanut butter, they are a versatile ingredient for sauces, baked goods, and stir-fries.
When shopping for peanuts, look for lightly salted or salt-free varieties to reduce sodium content. You should also look for  peanut butters  marketed as “natural,” as these are usually low in sodium and added sugar.
Two tablespoons (32 grams) of unsalted peanuts provides ( 17 ):
Calories:  170
Carbs:  4 grams
Protein:  8 grams
Fat:  15 grams
Fiber:  3 grams
Sodium:  6 mg
Magnesium:  12% of the DV

Fiber:  3 grams
Sodium:  125 mg

7–9. Dry grains
Grains provide a convenient source of carbs and make up a vital part of many dishes eaten worldwide.
Oats  are a staple in many people’s diets for good reason.
They provide a good source of the  soluble fiber  beta glucan, which has been shown to help lower cholesterol and promote healthy blood sugar levels ( 19 ,  20 ).
You can cook oats with water or your choice of milk and top them with ingredients like berries, nuts, or seeds. They also serve as an excellent addition to numerous baked goods.
Just 1.3 ounces (40 grams) of uncooked oats offers ( 21 ):
Calories:  150
Carbs:  27 grams
Protein:  5 grams
Fat:  3 grams
Fiber:  4 grams
Magnesium:  13% of the DV
Like oats, barley is a good source of  beta glucan .
This grain is often sold pearled, which means the fibrous outer shell has been removed to make it more palatable.
Barley  makes a great addition to cold or warm salads and soups. When cooked, it can also be eaten on its own as a nutritious carb source.
One cup (170 grams) of cooked barley contains ( 22 ):
Calories:  207
Carbs:  48 grams
Protein:  4 grams
Fat:  less than 1 gram
Fiber:  6 grams
Phosphorus:  7% of the DV
Rice is a staple food in many cultures worldwide as a result of its wide availability and reasonable cost.
It comes in many varieties, including white, brown, black, jasmine, and basmati.  Brown rice  has slightly more fiber since it’s less processed.
Rice serves as a fantastic carb source on its own, though you can also add it to casseroles, paellas, and soups, as well as desserts like rice pudding.
One cup (158 grams) of cooked  white rice  boasts ( 23 ):
Calories:  204
Carbs:  44 grams
Protein:  4 grams

10–12. Frozen and canned vegetables
Vegetables provide essential micronutrients your body needs to function, including folate, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, and vitamins A, C, and K ( 25 ).
In addition, most veggies are quite low in calories and high in fiber, which may aid weight loss by keeping you feeling full ( 26 ).
It’s easy to stock up on frozen or canned veggies since they don’t spoil. Moreover, they’re usually processed shortly after harvesting, which may mean they’re fresher than some options in the produce aisle ( 27 ,  28 ).
It’s important to read the nutrition label, as many canned vegetables contain added sodium.
Green beans  are a versatile frozen or canned veggie, easy to eat on their own or add to casseroles.
They provide a good source of fiber, as well as folic acid and vitamins A, C, and K.
Just 2/3 cup (81 grams) of green beans provides ( 29 ):
Calories:  23

Broccoli is a powerhouse cruciferous vegetable that’s high in fiber, potassium, and vitamins C and K.
While fresh  broccoli  is sometimes expensive, frozen broccoli is cheap. Canned broccoli is uncommon due to its soft texture.

13–15. Canned beans
Beans are chock-full of fiber, protein, and numerous micronutrients, including folate, magnesium, and vitamin B6 ( 32 ,  33 ).
While dried beans require soaking and long cooking times,  canned beans  are very convenient since they come precooked and can be eaten right out of the can.
Some canned beans may contain excess sodium. When shopping, it’s best to opt for low sodium options.
Black beans  work well in cold salads, salsas, soups, tacos, quesadillas, and various casseroles.
You can even use them to make burgers and brownies.

Fish is an excellent source of protein. Many types are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, a healthy fat that promotes heart health ( 11 ).
Canned fish is convenient and nutritious, but be sure to read the label since some products contain high amounts of added sodium.
Canned tuna is an excellent ready-to-eat protein. Just mix it with a bit of  mayo  and chopped celery for an easy tuna salad or form it into patties to make tuna burgers.
Look for  tuna  packed in water as opposed to oil if you’re aiming to reduce your calorie intake.

You can prepare eggs in several ways, including boiled, fried, scrambled, and poached. Meanwhile,  egg whites  are pasteurized, so they’re safe to add to shakes and smoothies to boost protein content.
