A quick look at the best melatonin supplements for kids
Best overall:   Natrol Kids Melatonin Gummies
Best chewable:   Nested Naturals LUNA Kids
Best powder:  Tired Teddies Invisimix
Best gummies:   Vivanaturals Melatonin Gummies for Kids

An  April 2023 JAMA study  analyzed the quantities of melatonin in samples of melatonin gummies. Researchers found that not only were quantities declared inaccurately on the labels, but that some of the melatonin gummies actually contained CBD. The study also noted that “children might intentionally or unintentionally ingest melatonin gummies.”
While the product names were not disclosed, the study highlights the importance of selecting supplements that are third-party tested for purity and potency to confirm label accuracy.
According to some research, an estimated 25% of all children and 75% of children with neurological disorders experience difficulties sleeping ( 1 ).
If your child regularly has trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, you may be considering a melatonin supplement ( 1 ).
This article will review the safety and dosage recommendations of melatonin for kids and provide a list of dietitian- and Healthline-approved picks for the best kid-friendly melatonin supplements.

What is melatonin?
Melatonin  is a hormone your body produces that plays an important role in your circadian rhythm — your body’s internal clock that correlates with sleep and wake cycles ( 2 ).
Melatonin also naturally occurs in several foods, including eggs, fish, milk, rice, and some fruits and vegetables ( 3 ).
When used as a supplement, melatonin has been shown to improve an individual’s ability to fall asleep and stay asleep, which is why it’s often used to treat sleep disorders such as insomnia ( 2 ).

Is melatonin safe for kids?
Some research has found melatonin to be both  safe and effective for kids  with sleep disorders and neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ).
However, there is not yet enough available research to determine an appropriate dose for kids based on age and severity of sleep issues ( 4 ).
Additionally, no research currently supports the effectiveness and safety of melatonin supplements in infants. It’s best to avoid giving infants melatonin unless under the direct supervision of a pediatrician or pediatric registered dietitian.
Some products are suitable for children over age 1, though most are recommended only for kids over age 3 or 4.
Finally, keep in mind that experts recommend trying  other sleep interventions , such as developing a consistent bedtime routine, before giving your child a melatonin supplement ( 7 ,  8 ).
Potential side effects  of melatonin supplements include drowsiness the following morning and an increase in urination at night ( 1 ,  8 ).
While no serious adverse effects have been observed at small doses, more research is needed on the long-term safety of melatonin supplementation in kids ( 9 ).

Dosing considerations
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends starting with a low dose of just 0.5–1 mg, 30–90 minutes before bedtime. The AAP also states that most children will not need doses higher than 3–6 mg ( 8 ).
It’s important to talk with your pediatrician to determine an appropriate dose for your child.

LUNA Kids is designed for kids 4 years and older and contains just 0.2 mg of melatonin, making it a great choice if your pediatrician recommends a low dose for your child.
It comes in a tropical berry-flavored chewable tablet that is naturally sweetened with stevia and is meant to be taken 30 minutes before bedtime.
In addition to melatonin, the supplement includes lemon balm powder, valerian root powder, and chamomile flower powder.
Limited research suggests that  lemon balm  may help improve symptoms of anxiety and depression, though more research on its use for sleep in children is needed ( 10 ).
Valerian root  has also been found to promote sleep. However, while it is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA, research on its use in children is limited ( 11 ,  12 ).
It’s worth noting that this product also contains xylitol, a sugar alcohol that is unsafe for pets and can cause stomach upset in people when taken in large amounts ( 13 ).
LUNA Kids is vegan, non-GMO, and third-party tested for purity and potency.

In addition to melatonin, the supplement contains 100 mg of a proprietary blend made up of  chamomile , lemon balm, and lettuce.
The manufacturer does not list the amount of each specific ingredient in the proprietary blend. Therefore, the product isn’t a good option if your child has a sensitivity to any of the ingredients.
This powder is produced in an NSF-certified facility to ensure purity, potency, and safe manufacturing practices.

According to the label, 1–2 gummies should be taken 30 minutes before bedtime — but keep in mind that taking 2 gummies will increase the melatonin dose to 1 mg.
These gummies also contain chamomile extract, lemon balm extract, passionflower extract, and  L-theanine , an amino acid that may help improve sleep quality.
One study found that, when combined with vitamin B6, L-theanine was effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety in children with  Tourette syndrome  ( 14 ).
Research in adults suggests that L-theanine may help improve sleep quality and duration. However, this effect has not been confirmed in children ( 15 ).
OLLY products are third-party tested and produced in NSF-certified facilities.

A comparison of the best melatonin supplements for kids
Here’s a quick look at how our top picks compare:

How to choose
When shopping for kid-friendly melatonin supplements, be sure to consider the following factors:
Dose:  It’s generally recommended to start with a dose of 0.5–1 mg. However, it’s important to discuss the appropriate dose for your child with a pediatrician. Especially for younger kids, it’s a good idea to choose a product that provides a lower dose per serving.
Cost:  When considering cost, be sure to look at the price per serving.
Quality:  Choose a product that is produced by a reputable company and has been tested, ideally by a third-party lab such as  NSF ,  USP , or  ConsumerLab . This will ensure that the product contains what the label claims it does.
Type of product:  Melatonin supplements are available in several forms, including gummies, liquids, powders, and chewable tablets. Be sure to choose a product that’s appropriate for your child.

Alternatives to melatonin
Melatonin shouldn’t be the first line of defense against poor sleep. Below are a few suggestions to help your child get a better night’s sleep.
The AAP recommends focusing on developing good sleep habits before trying a melatonin supplement ( 8 ).
Having a  consistent bedtime routine  that begins at the same time each night can help your child unwind and get ready to sleep.
Your child’s body naturally produces melatonin that can help them fall asleep.
However, screens, such as TVs and video games, give off blue light waves that suppress melatonin production and can interfere with sleep ( 16 ).
Meditation may also be useful. One study in more than 11,000 children under age 18 found that parents noticed improved sleep when their children used  Calm , a meditation app ( 17 ).
Meditation has also been shown to be effective for improving sleep quality in adults ( 18 ).
Research suggests that regularly consuming melatonin-containing foods may help boost melatonin levels in the body, which, in turn, could help improve sleep ( 3 ).
Here are some melatonin-rich foods you may be able to include in your child’s diet ( 3 ):
eggs
fish
milk
oats
grapes
cherries
strawberries
tomatoes
bell peppers

When to visit your child’s doctor
If your child is regularly struggling to fall asleep or stay asleep, it’s worth making an appointment with a pediatrician to rule out a  sleep disorder  or neurological condition ( 19 ).
Always consult a pediatrician before giving your child a new supplement.

Frequently asked questions
Melatonin is recommended for only short-term use. It’s a good idea to schedule an appointment with your child’s pediatrician if you find that your child needs melatonin to sleep every night ( 8 ).
The AAP recommends discussing appropriate doses with your pediatrician before trying melatonin.
However, children generally respond to doses of 0.5–1 mg, 30–90 minutes before bedtime. Some may need a higher dose, but, according to the AAP, most kids should not need doses higher than 3–6 mg ( 8 ).
Also keep in mind that melatonin supplements haven’t been found to be safe or effective for kids under age 1. Never give an infant melatonin unless under the direct supervision of a pediatrician or pediatric registered dietitian.
Melatonin supplements are available in a variety of forms, including capsules, chewable tablets, gummies, and liquids. The best form is the one that your child tolerates and can safely swallow.
That being said, it’s important to follow the instructions and dosing listed on the label, as these can vary among products.

The bottom line
Melatonin is a hormone that helps regulate sleep and wake cycles. While the human body naturally produces melatonin, some kids with disrupted sleep may benefit from short-term use of melatonin supplements.
Before giving your child a melatonin supplement, consider non-supplement methods such as building a consistent bedtime routine, limiting screen time,  practicing meditation , and adding more melatonin-rich foods to their diet.
Be sure to meet with your child’s pediatrician to discuss the appropriateness and suitable dosing of melatonin before giving it to your child.
