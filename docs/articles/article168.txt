Title: 7 Signs and Symptoms of Magnesium Deficiency

Magnesium deficiency, also known as hypomagnesemia, is an often-overlooked health problem. The symptoms of low magnesium can vary. They can be both physical and mental.
Estimates state that while  2–15%  of Americans experience magnesium deficiency, that percentage is far greater in hospital and ICU patients and people with diabetes or  alcohol use disorder .
In some cases, deficiency may be underdiagnosed since the obvious signs commonly don’t appear until your levels become severely low.
Health conditions such as diabetes, poor absorption, chronic diarrhea, and celiac disease are associated with magnesium loss. People with alcohol use disorder are also at an increased risk of deficiency.
This article lists 7 symptoms of magnesium deficiency.

Muscle twitches and cramps
Twitches, tremors, and muscle cramps  are signs  of magnesium deficiency. In worst-case scenarios, deficiency may even cause seizures or convulsions.
Scientists believe  these symptoms are caused by a greater flow of  calcium  into nerve cells, which overexcites or hyperstimulates the muscle nerves.
Keep in mind that involuntary  muscle twitches  may have many other causes. For example, stress or  excessive caffeine  could also cause involuntary muscle spasms.
They may also be a side effect of some medications or a symptom of neuromuscular disease such as  muscular dystrophy , multiple sclerosis, or myasthenia gravis.
Common signs of magnesium deficiency include muscle twitches, tremors, and cramps. However, supplements are unlikely to reduce these symptoms in older adults or people who aren’t deficient in magnesium.

Mental health conditions
Mental health conditions are another possible effect of magnesium deficiency.
One example is  apathy , which is characterized by mental numbness or  lack of emotion . Low magnesium levels  may also  increase a person’s risk of stress, depression,  and anxiety .
One review  concluded that  magnesium supplements  might benefit a subset of people with  anxiety  disorders, but the quality of the evidence is poor. However, higher-quality studies are neccesary to reach further conclusions.
Magnesium deficiency may cause lack of emotion, delirium, and even coma. Scientists have suggested that deficiency may also cause anxiety, but no strong evidence supports this idea.

Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis  is a disorder characterized by  weak bones  and an increased risk of bone fractures.
Magnesium deficiency is  a risk factor  for osteoporosis. Deficiency might weaken bones directly, but it also lowers the blood levels of  calcium , the main building block of bones.
Numerous factors influence the risk of developing osteoporosis, including:
aging
lack of exercise
poor dietary intake of vitamins D and K
Magnesium deficiency may be one of the risk factors for osteoporosis and bone fractures, though many factors influence this risk.

Fatigue and muscle weakness
Fatigue is a broad term that includes symptoms of physical and  mental exhaustion  or weakness. Typically, it simply means you need to rest. However, severe or persistent fatigue may indicate a health problem.
Both general fatigue and specific  muscle weakness  are  symptoms of magnesium deficiency . Low magnesium levels affect multiple body processes including nerve signaling and  potassium  levels in muscle cells, which respectively may cause fatigue and weakness.
Magnesium deficiency may cause fatigue or muscle weakness. However, these are not specific signs of a deficiency unless they are accompanied by other symptoms.

High blood pressure
Animal studies  show that magnesium deficiency may increase blood pressure and promote  high blood pressure , which is a strong risk factor for heart disease.
While direct evidence in humans is lacking, research suggests that low magnesium levels or poor dietary intake may raise blood pressure
Additionally,  reviews  show that magnesium supplements may lower blood pressure, especially in adults with high blood pressure.
Evidence suggests magnesium deficiency may raise blood pressure. Additionally, supplements may benefit people with high blood pressure.

Asthma
Magnesium deficiency is  common  in people with  severe asthma . Additionally, magnesium levels tend to be lower in individuals with asthma than in people who do not have this condition.
Inhalers with magnesium sulfate can often help reduce mild  asthma symptoms , and intravenous magnesium sulfate is an  effective treatment  for severe exacerbations.
However, evidence for the effectiveness of dietary magnesium supplements in individuals with asthma is inconsistent.
Magnesium deficiency has been associated with severe asthma. However, its role in the development of asthma is not entirely understood.

Irregular heartbeat
Heart  arrhythmia , or irregular heartbeat, is a potentially  severe effect  of magnesium deficiency.
Arrhythmia can range from causing no symptoms to causing very serious symptoms. In some people, it may cause heart palpitations, which are pauses between heartbeats.
In the most severe cases, arrhythmia may increase the risk of stroke or heart failure.
Magnesium deficiency can cause or worsen arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, which may increase the risk of more serious complications, such as a stroke or heart failure.

How to get enough magnesium
The table below shows the  Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)  or adequate intake (AI) of magnesium for people in the United States.
*Adequate intake
Although many people don’t reach the RDA for magnesium, there are plenty of magnesium-rich foods to choose from.
Magnesium is widely found in both plant- and animal-based foods. The richest sources are seeds and nuts, but whole grains, beans, and  leafy green vegetables  are also relatively good sources.
If you have a health condition that causes your body to lose magnesium, such as diabetes, it’s important to eat plenty of magnesium-rich foods or take supplements.
Talk with your doctor about creating a plan to increase your magnesium intake that works well for your needs.

The bottom line
The symptoms of magnesium deficiency are usually subtle unless your levels become severely low.
Deficiency may cause:
fatigue
muscle cramps
mental health conditions
irregular heartbeat
osteoporosis
If you believe you may have a magnesium deficiency, you should speak with your doctor.
