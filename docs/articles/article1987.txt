Title: 15 Foods and Drinks to Avoid During Pregnancy - What Not to Eat

Foods to avoid during pregnancy typically include those that carry a risk of infection, such as undercooked or raw meat or fish, but you’ll want to limit your intake of caffeine and processed foods, too.
It’s essential to eat well during pregnancy to nourish both yourself and your unborn child. You may have to give up some of your favorite foods, such as  sushi ,  coffee , or  rare steak .
Thankfully, there are plenty of  foods you can eat during pregnancy  to stay healthy.
Here are 15 foods and beverages to avoid or minimize while pregnant.

1. High mercury fish
Mercury is highly toxic element and can occur in polluted waters.
In higher amounts, it can affect your nervous system, immune system, and kidneys. It  may also cause  serious developmental problems in children, with adverse effects even in lower amounts.
Large marine fish can accumulate high amounts of mercury, so it’s best to avoid  high mercury fish  during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
High-mercury fish to avoid include:
shark
swordfish
king mackerel
tuna (especially bigeye tuna)
marlin
tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico
orange roughy

2. Undercooked or raw fish
Raw fish , especially shellfish, have a high risk of containing bacteria or  parasites  such as  norovirus ,  Vibrio ,  Salmonella , and  Listeria .
Raw fish can become infected during handling, storing, and processing, including smoking or drying.
These types of infections can cause  dehydration  and weakness in the parents, and some can pass through the placenta to your baby, even if you don’t have any symptoms. They can increase the risk of preterm delivery,  pregnancy loss , stillbirth, and other serious health problems, according to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) .
The CDC notes that the chance of having a  listeria infection  is up to  10 times  higher during pregnancy than at other times.
Is raw fish safe to eat outside of pregnancy?

3. Undercooked or raw meat
Eating undercooked or raw meat can also  increase your risk  of infection from bacteria or parasites, including  Toxoplasma ,  E. coli ,  Listeria , and  Salmonella .
Bacteria may threaten your own health and the health and safety of your little one.
Most bacteria occur on the surface of whole pieces of meat, but other bacteria may linger inside the muscle fibers.
Some whole cuts of meat — such as tenderloins, sirloins, or ribeye from  beef , lamb and veal — may be safe to consume when not cooked all the way through. However, this only applies when the piece of meat is whole or uncut, and  completely cooked  on the outside. During pregnancy, it’s best to avoid any undercooked meat.
Cut meat, including meat patties, burgers, minced meat,  pork , and poultry, are never safe to eat raw or undercooked.
Is raw meat generally safe to eat?

4. Processed and deli meat
Hot dogs, lunch meat, pepperoni, and deli meat can also  become infected  with various bacteria during processing or storage. Cured meats are not cooked and may have bacteria or parasites.
In addition,  processed meats  can contain  high levels of sodium  and unhealthy fats.
It’s best to avoid deli meats and ensure  processed meats  you cook, such as sausages, are cooked through.
Why is processed meat bad for you?

5. Raw eggs
Raw  eggs  can  contain   Salmonella  bacteria.
Symptoms of a  salmonella infection  include fever, nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and diarrhea. It may also cause cramps in the uterus, potentially leading to  preterm birth  or stillbirth.
Foods that commonly contain raw eggs include:
lightly  scrambled eggs
tiramisu
raw batter
hollandaise sauce
homemade mayonnaise
some homemade salad dressings
homemade egg nog
homemade ice cream
some homemade cake icings
eggs Benedict
Most commercial products containing raw eggs are made with pasteurized eggs and are safe to consume. However, always  read the label  to make sure.
Make sure to always cook eggs thoroughly or use pasteurized eggs.
Are raw eggs generally safe to eat?

6. Organ meat
Organ meats  provide a range of essential nutrients, such as  iron , vitamin B12, vitamin A,  zinc ,  selenium , and  copper  — all of which are good for you and baby.
However, consuming too much preformed vitamin A, especially in the first trimester of pregnancy, can lead to congenital malformations and pregnancy loss.
Although this is mostly  associated  with vitamin A supplements, it’s best to eat just a few ounces a week of meats like liver or kidney.
What’s the nutritional value of organ meats?

7. Raw sprouts
Raw sprouts, including  alfalfa , clover, radish, and mung  bean sprouts , are popular in salads.
However, the humid environment the seeds need to start sprouting is ideal for the growth of  Salmonella , and it’s almost impossible to it wash off.
For this reason, it’s best to avoid raw sprouts altogether, although sprouts are safe to consume when cooked, according to the  FDA .
What’s to know about raw sprouts?

8. Unwashed fruits and vegetables
The surface of unwashed or unpeeled  fruits  and vegetables may be contaminated with bacteria and parasites such as  Toxoplasma ,  E. coli ,  Salmonella , and  Listeria . These can come from the soil or through handling.
Contamination can occur at any time during production, harvest, processing, storage, transportation, or retail.
Toxoplasma  is a parasite that can linger on plant foods. Most people have no symptoms, but the parasite can cross the placenta  and cause   vision loss  and learning difficulties later in life. In some cases, severe eye or brain damage may be present at birth.
To minimize the risk of infection, thoroughly wash all fruits and vegetables with clean water and peel or cook them before eating.
It is ever a good idea to drink raw milk?

9. Unpasteurized dairy products
Raw milk  and other unpasteurized dairy products can  contain  harmful bacteria, including  Listeria ,  Salmonella ,  E. coli , and  Campylobacter . These bacteria can cause a range of infections commonly called food poisoning.
These infections can all have life-threatening consequences for an unborn baby.
The bacteria can occur naturally or result from contamination during collection or storage. Pasteurization can kill any harmful bacteria without changing the nutritional value of the products.
To reduce the risk of infections, eat only pasteurized dairy products.

10. Soft cheeses
Some soft cheeses  contain  listeria, a type of bacteria that can cause severe illness and pregnancy loss.
Examples include queso fresco, queso blanco, queso blando, queso panela, and queso ranchero.
Only eat soft cheeses that have a label to show they are pasteurized.
What cheeses are safe to eat during pregnancy?

11. Processed foods
Highly  processed foods  tend to be low in nutrients and high in calories,  sugar , and added fats, and they may increase the risk of weight gain.
During pregnancy, you need a good intake of nutrients, such as  protein, folate, choline, and iron .
Also, while some  weight gain  is necessary, excess weight gain  can increase the risk  of delivery complications and childhood obesity.
Stick to meals and snacks that focus on protein, vegetables and fruits,  healthy fats , and fiber-rich  carbohydrates  like whole grains, beans, and  starchy vegetables .
Explore some  new ways  to sneak veggies into your meals without sacrificing taste.

12. Some fruit juices and smoothies
Fruit juices can be beneficial during pregnancy, but opt for juices that are pasteurized and have no added sugar.
Raw juices, like those squeezed on market stalls,  may contain  harmful bacteria. Smoothies may also contain unpasteurized juice, so ask about the ingredients beforehand if you’re in a restaurant.
Which fruits are good to eat in pregnancy?

13. Alcohol
During pregnancy, alcohol  increases the risk  of pregnancy loss, and stillbirth, and  fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) . FAS can affect many aspects of development, including the heart and the brain.
Since no level of alcohol has been proven to be safe during pregnancy, it’s best to avoid it altogether.
Learn more about pregnancy, alcohol, and drugs.

14. Caffeine
Coffee ,  tea , soft drinks, and cocoa all contain  caffeine .
Research has linked a high intake of caffeine to a risk of pregnancy loss, stillbirth, small weight at birth, and various developmental issues.
Caffeine is absorbed very quickly and passes easily into the placenta. Because babies and their placentas don’t have the main  enzyme  needed to metabolize caffeine, high levels can build up.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends limiting caffeine intake to less than  200 milligrams (mg)  per day during pregnancy.
How much caffeine is safe in pregnancy?

15. Contaminated drinking water
It’s essential to  drink plenty of water  during pregnancy to avoid dehydration.
Most tap water in the United States is  safe to drink , but contaminants in unclean or polluted  drinking water  can harm you or your unborn baby. This may affect you if you use water from a private well, as the Environmental Protection Agency does not test this water.
Contact your local health authority or environmental agency if you have concerns about your water.
Is tap water safe to drink?
