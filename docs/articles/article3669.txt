Title: 8 Healthy Swaps for Everyday Food and Drinks

Some healthy food alternatives to include in your diet include baked potato chips, oatmeal, dark chocolate-covered fruit, and homemade coffee creamers, amongst others.
Some foods and beverages that people consume daily are full of sugar, unhealthy fats, and refined carbohydrates. These may harm your health if eaten regularly and lead to some chronic health conditions.
Fortunately, healthier substitutes for many of these items are easy to buy or make at home.
Here are 8 healthy swaps for everyday foods and drinks.

1. Use a homemade, low sugar creamer instead of coffee creamer
Creamer  gives coffee a smooth, sweet taste and comes in a variety of flavors.
However, coffee creamer is typically packed with  added sugar , often in the form of  high-fructose corn syrup . This sweetener is linked to several negative health effects,  such as :
weight gain
insulin resistance
obesity
liver disorders
diabetes
Coffee creamer substitutes  are surprisingly easy to make.
Here’s a recipe for a dairy-free creamer alternative that’s low in added sugar:
One 13.5-ounce (400-ml) can of whole or reduced-fat  coconut milk
1 tbsp (15 ml) of  maple syrup
1 tsp (5 ml) of  vanilla extract
Place the ingredients in a bottle or glass mason jar and shake well. Keep it in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or freeze in ice cube trays for long-term storage.
You can also add a dash of  cinnamon ,  coconut extract , or a pinch of pumpkin pie spice for a seasonal twist.
Shake your creamer well before using it.

2. Drink sparkling water, green tea, or kombucha instead of soda
There are many  negative health effects of drinking soda  and other sugary beverages. For example, soda is associated with an  increased risk of :
diabetes
obesity
metabolic syndrome
fatty liver disease
Switching to  diet soda  may also  increase your risk  of conditions like metabolic syndrome and  stroke .
Some healthy fizzy drink alternatives for  soda  include:
infused  sparkling water
sparkling  green tea
kombucha
Keep in mind that  plain water  is your best bet for staying hydrated and managing your weight.

3. Try oatmeal, chia pudding, or a yogurt parfait instead of sugary cereal
A bowl of cereal is a staple breakfast for many people. But, most cereals are high in sugar and low in filling nutrients like  protein  and  fiber .
What’s more,  sugary cereals  marketed to children are often packed with high-fructose corn syrup and artificial food dyes like  Red Dye 40 . These have been  associated with  behavioral issues in children.
For a  healthier alternative , choose one of the following high protein, high fiber breakfasts:
oatmeal  topped with  berries  and  nuts
chia pudding
muesli
plain  Greek yogurt  with berries, unsweetened  coconut , and crushed  almonds

4. Choose a healthy or homemade granola bar
Granola bars are a go-to snack choice for many people. Yet, most popular granola bars are filled with added sugars and other sweet ingredients, such as chocolate chips or candy coatings.
That said, some brands manufacture healthy choices that use whole foods and include protein and fiber, such as:
Thunderbird
RX
KIND Bars
Autumn’s Gold
Additionally, try making  homemade granola bars . They’re typically low in added sugar and use healthy ingredients like nuts, oats, seeds, coconut, and dried fruit.

5. Try teas and coffee instead of energy drinks
Energy drinks  may help increase your concentration and focus, as well as physical energy.
However, according to the  National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) , energy drinks are associated with several health issues, including:
heartbeat abnormalities
hypertension
anxiety
sleeping troubles
cardiovascular issues
Energy drinks are also loaded with added sugars.
Instead, some healthier, unsweetened caffeinated drinks may help perk you up. These may include:
green tea
black tea
oolong tea
yerba mate
coffee
matcha
These energy drink alternatives may offer other benefits as well. For example, green tea is packed with  antioxidants  that may  help boost  your heart, skin, and brain health.
Lifestyle changes like eating a  nutritious diet  and  exercising  may also help you stay alert without relying on stimulants.

6. Enjoy homemade chips or roasted chickpeas instead of chips
With their salty taste and crunchy texture, chips are a satisfying snack.
However, most store-bought potato chips are usually highly processed. This means they’re full of added ingredients that aren’t good for you, such as sugars and food dyes.
That said, some  healthy chips  are available, which are typically made with whole foods.
Alternatively, you can try making some healthy chip substitutes, including:
Baked potato chips:  The  Chron’s and Colitis Foundation ‘s tasty recipe uses only potatoes and seasoning.
Kale chips:  Low in calories but packed with nutrients,  kale  chips are a great snack. You can make your own by following  this recipe .
Beet chips:   Beets  are brightly colored vegetables that have  anti-inflammatory , anticancer, and antioxidant properties. They’re delicious when made into nutrient-dense,  crunchy chips .
Roasted chickpeas:  Chickpeas  are loaded with fiber and  magnesium , a mineral  that’s important  for blood sugar control and nerve function. Follow  this recipe  to make crispy chickpeas for a chip alternative.
You can also make chips in the oven with other vegetables, such as  plantains ,  zucchinis , and  parsnips .

7. Try whole grain, sprouted bread instead of white bread
Lots of people prefer the soft, pillowy texture of white  bread  over heartier breads like whole wheat or rye. Yet, white bread offers  little nutritional value , as it’s low in fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals.
Swapping it with  more nutritious options  can improve your health.
Try a whole grain, sprouted bread like  Ezekiel bread . It’s high in protein and fiber, and the sprouting process may  increase the availability  of certain nutrients.
Plus, you can choose other delicious, grain-free alternatives, including:
Sweet potato toast:  Thin, toasted slices of  sweet potato  are nutritious, tasty, and versatile.
Swiss chard or lettuce wraps:  Wrapping sandwich ingredients in a leaf of  Swiss chard  or  romaine lettuce  can help reduce your calorie intake while boosting your vitamin, mineral, and antioxidant levels.
Portobello mushroom caps:  Portobello  mushrooms  are packed with nutrients like  B vitamins  and  selenium .
Other  alternative bread options  include  cauliflower  bread,  flax  bread, and  100% rye bread .

8. Eat dried fruit or dark chocolate instead of candy
Enjoying an occasional sweet treat is perfectly healthy. However, eating sugary foods like candy too often can  increase your risk  of conditions like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.
Still, it’s easy to buy or make numerous  naturally sweet candy alternatives . These include:
Dried fruit:   Dried fruits  are a concentrated source of sweetness that delivers  more nutritional value  than candy. Try swapping candy with small amounts of unsweetened dried strawberries, mango, or apples.
Energy balls:  Homemade energy balls pack a wealth of nutrients. Try  this recipe , which balances sweet ingredients with protein-rich ones.
Dark chocolate-covered fruit:  Dunking fruits like banana slices or strawberries into antioxidant-rich  dark chocolate  is another healthy way to  satisfy  your candy cravings.

Takeaway
Making healthy swaps for everyday foods and beverages can be simple and delicious.
Plus, reducing your intake of foods that are high in calories and low in nutrients by eating more  whole foods  can significantly improve your overall health.
If you need more recommendations for healthy food and drink alternatives, speak with a healthcare professional.
