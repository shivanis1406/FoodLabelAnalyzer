Title: 8 Proven Ways to Increase Testosterone Levels Naturally

Testosterone affects many aspects of your health, from sexual function to disease risk. You may be able to increase your levels naturally by lifting weights and getting more of certain nutrients.
Testosterone is a steroid hormone that the body mainly produces in the testicles and ovaries. The adrenal glands also produce small amounts.
During puberty in people assigned male at birth, testosterone is one of the main drivers of physical changes like muscle development, voice changes, and hair growth. People assigned female at birth produce testosterone but in lower quantities and have higher estrogen levels. ( 1 ,  2 ).
Having optimal levels is also important throughout adulthood. In adult males, healthy levels are important for general health, including disease risk and sexual function ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ).
Additionally, increasing your testosterone to optimal levels may increase muscle mass and strength ( 6 ,  7 ,  8 ).
Interestingly, testosterone also plays an important role in female health and sexual well-being ( 9 ,  10 ).
Here are eight evidence-based ways to increase your testosterone levels naturally.

1. Exercise and lift weights
Exercise is one of the most effective ways to prevent many lifestyle-related diseases. Not only that but it can also boost your testosterone levels. One 2015 study involving men with obesity found that  increased physical activity  was more beneficial than calorie restriction for increasing testosterone levels ( 11 ).
According to one literature review, the effects on testosterone levels can vary based on several factors, including the type of exercise and the training intensity ( 12 ).
Resistance training, such as weightlifting, has been shown to boost testosterone levels in the short term ( 13 ).
High-intensity interval training (HIIT)  can be very effective as well, although all types of exercise should work to some extent ( 14 ,  15 ).
All forms of exercise may increase your testosterone levels, especially weightlifting and high intensity interval training.

2. Eat protein, fat, and carbs
What you eat  can affect levels of testosterone as well as other hormones ( 16 ).
Eating enough  protein  can help you maintain healthy testosterone levels and can aid in fat loss, which may be beneficial too. Additionally, constant dieting or overeating may disrupt your testosterone levels ( 17 ,  18 ,  19 ).
Consuming healthy fats may also help support testosterone levels and hormone balance. Some research shows that a low fat diet could decrease testosterone levels ( 20 ).
Therefore, a nutritious, well-rounded diet based mainly on  whole foods  is best. A healthy balance of protein, fat, and carbs can help optimize your hormone levels and support your overall health.
Following a nutritious, well-rounded diet with balanced amounts of protein, fat, and carbs may help support healthy testosterone levels.

3. Minimize stress and cortisol levels
Research often highlights the dangers of long-term stress, which can elevate levels of the hormone cortisol ( 21 ,  22 ).
Sudden elevations in cortisol can quickly reduce testosterone. These hormones often work in a seesaw-like manner: As one goes up, the other comes down ( 16 ).
Stress and high cortisol can also increase food intake, weight gain, and the storage of harmful body fat around your organs. These changes may negatively affect testosterone levels ( 23 ,  24 ).
For both optimal health and hormone levels, try to  manage your stress levels . Staying active, getting plenty of sleep each night, and practicing some stress-relieving techniques may be beneficial.
Chronic stress can negatively affect health and reduce testosterone levels.

4. Increase vitamin D intake
Vitamin D  is a micronutrient that plays a key role in many aspects of health. Despite its importance, up to 1 billion people worldwide are deficient ( 25 ,  26 ).
Some research shows that low vitamin D levels may be linked to lower testosterone levels ( 27 ,  28 ).
Additionally, a 2017 study involving 102 men with a vitamin D deficiency found that taking a vitamin D supplement increased testosterone levels and improved erectile dysfunction. However, more research is needed, as other studies yield conflicting results ( 29 ,  30 ,  31 ).
To maintain healthy levels of vitamin D, try to get regular exposure to sunlight or consider taking a vitamin D3 supplement as directed by a healthcare professional.
Some studies have found that low levels of vitamin D could be associated with decreased testosterone levels. However, more research is needed to determine whether supplementation may be beneficial.

5. Consider taking supplements
Although the potential benefits of  multivitamins  are hotly debated, certain supplements may be useful for supporting healthy testosterone levels.
In one study,  zinc supplementation  increased testosterone levels and improved sexual function in postmenopausal women with low blood levels of zinc ( 32 ).
According to another review, zinc supplementation could also benefit men with low testosterone levels and infertility, particularly if they have a testosterone deficiency ( 33 ).
Older studies suggest that several herbal supplements could also help support healthy testosterone levels, including  saw palmetto ,  ginger , and  ashwagandha . However, more research is needed ( 34 ,  35 ,  36 ).
If you decide to add any supplements to your routine, talk with a healthcare professional first, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.
Zinc supplements could support healthy testosterone levels, especially for people with testosterone deficiency. Other herbal supplements like saw palmetto, ginger, and ashwagandha may also be beneficial, but more studies are needed.
The Food and Drug Administration does not monitor supplements for quality the same way other drugs are by the FDA. People can benefit from researching manufacturers and consulting healthcare professionals before taking them.

6. Get plenty of restful, high quality sleep
Getting good sleep  is as important for your health as diet and exercise ( 37 ).
Sleep quality may also have major effects on your testosterone levels. In fact, one study involving 2,295 teenage boys and men found that impaired sleep could be linked to lower levels of testosterone ( 38 ).
The ideal amount of sleep varies from person to person, but a small 2011 study found that sleeping only 5 hours per night was linked to a 10%–15% reduction in testosterone levels ( 39 ).
Interestingly, one study involving older men found that an increased sleep duration of up to 9.9 hours was associated with increased testosterone levels. Conversely, sleeping more than 9.9 hours was tied to lower testosterone levels ( 40 ).
Although some people do fine with less sleep, most research recommends aiming for at least 7 hours every night ( 41 ).
It’s important to get plenty of high quality sleep to maintain healthy testosterone levels and optimize overall health.

7. Avoid estrogen-like chemicals
Several other factors may affect your hormone levels. For starters, a healthy sex life is important in regulating your sex hormone and testosterone levels ( 42 ).
High exposure to estrogen-like chemicals may also affect testosterone levels. Try to minimize daily exposure to  bisphenol-A (BPA) , parabens, and other chemicals found in some types of plastic ( 43 ,  44 ).
Reducing exposure to estrogen-like chemicals can positively affect your testosterone levels and health.

8. Watch your alcohol intake
The relationship between alcohol and testosterone is complex. Some research suggests that  excessive alcohol consumption  can decrease testosterone levels ( 45 ).
Testosterone levels may drop as quickly as 30 minutes after you drink alcohol. Heavy alcohol use can lead to reduced testicular function and testicular atrophy ( 46 ).
Interestingly, studies involving adolescent boys and young men have found that testosterone levels can be used to predict alcohol dependence or the onset of alcohol use. Higher levels in the saliva or blood are associated with heavier use of alcohol and younger age at the onset of alcohol use ( 45 ).
Alcohol and testosterone have a complex relationship. It’s best to moderate your alcohol intake since excessive consumption can have a negative effect on your testosterone levels and testicular health.

The bottom line
Testosterone levels in males peak at 19 years and naturally decline with age. They decrease by an average of 1%–2% each year after age 30, although they may stabilize in your 40s or beyond ( 47 ,  48 ).
This decline is of concern because strong research shows a link between low testosterone and obesity, increased disease risk, and premature death ( 49 ,  50 ).
Healthy testosterone levels are also important for  people assigned female at birth , along with other key hormones such as estrogen and progesterone.
Following a nutritious diet and healthy lifestyle using some of the tips outlined above can help optimize testosterone levels and promote overall health.
