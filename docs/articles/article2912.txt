Who are Olly vitamins best for?
With more than 60 supplements to choose from, Olly offers products tailored to a wide range of health concerns and needs.
Olly supplements may be a good option for people who:

are looking for tasty,  kid-friendly multivitamins
are seeking supplements designed to support specific aspects of health, such as immunity, gut health, or mood

Ingredient quality and testing
Olly partners with both domestic and international facilities to produce its line of supplements, and all products are manufactured in facilities that comply with the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) established by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
According to the company’s website, all supplements are also third-party tested in the United States, though the specific testing lab or facility is not disclosed.
Furthermore, many products are certified by  NSF International , an independent organization that tests supplements to ensure safety and quality.
While Olly does not test any products on animals, not all Olly products are vegan-friendly.
In fact, most of the gummies are made with gelatin, which means they’re  unsuitable  for people following a vegan or vegetarian diet.

Olly products
Olly offers a wide range of products, many of which are intended to address specific health concerns.
Here is a closer look at a few of Olly’s most popular supplements.
Nutrition per 2-gummy serving:  20 calories, 4 grams (g) carbs, 2 g added sugars
Included nutrients:  thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, folate, biotin, pantothenic acid, phosphorus, iodine, zinc, selenium, chromium, boron, and vitamins A, C, D, E, B6, and B12
This berry-flavored gummy multivitamin contains a blend of nutrients  specifically for women .
It’s particularly high in  folate , a micronutrient that is essential during pregnancy to  help ensure  proper fetal development. Plus, it contains vitamin D, another important micronutrient that  supports  bone health and immune function.
In addition to being free of gluten and artificial flavors and colors, this women’s multivitamin is NSF-certified.
Nutrition per 2-gummy serving:  15 calories, 3 g carbs, 2 g added sugars
Active ingredients:  GABA, L-theanine, lemon balm extract
Featuring  gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) , L-theanine, and lemon balm, this strawberry verbena-flavored supplement is formulated to promote calmness and alertness.
L-theanine  is a compound found in green tea that has been shown to  reduce  symptoms of stress and  improve  attention.
Limited  research  also suggests that  lemon balm  may be helpful for reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety.
But more research on GABA’s effects is needed. In fact, a  2020 review  on the effects of GABA concluded that there is limited evidence to support any beneficial effects on stress.
Overall, while L-theanine and lemon balm may help reduce stress levels, more research is necessary. Furthermore, there’s no research on the effectiveness of this supplement specifically.
Like several other Olly products, Goodbye Stress is gluten-free, made without artificial ingredients, and NSF certified.
Nutrition per 1-gummy serving :  5 calories, 2 g carbs, 1 g fiber, <1 g added sugars
Active ingredients:   Bacillus coagulans  MTCC 5856, prebiotic blend (fructooligosaccharides, inulin, xylitol)
Olly’s peach-flavored Probiotic + Prebiotic supplement claims to help balance the digestive system and is made with a blend of live cultures and gut-friendly fiber.
Specifically, it contains 500 million colony-forming units (CFUs) of  Bacillus coagulans  MTCC 5856 per gummy. This is a strain of bacteria that has been  shown to reduce  symptoms of  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)  and  manage  other digestive disorders.
shown to reduce(opens in a new tab)
However, keep in mind that most studies use significantly higher doses of  B. coagulans  than this product contains.
Olly Probiotic + Prebiotic also contains  xylitol  and  inulin , both of which can promote digestive health by enhancing the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.
However, some people may have difficulty tolerating these ingredients and  may experience  digestive side effects.
This product is NSF certified and free of gluten and artificial ingredients.
Nutrition per 2-gummy serving:  15 calories, 3 g carbs, 2 g added sugars
Included nutrients:  biotin, keratin, and vitamins C and E
According to Olly, this grapefruit-flavored gummy can support beauty from the inside out by enhancing the health of the  hair, skin, and nails .
It contains biotin, a B vitamin that is often added to supplements to promote hair growth.
However, while  biotin  may be beneficial for hair health if you have a deficiency, there is  limited research  to support its use in people with sufficient blood levels of biotin.
It’s also formulated with vitamin C, a nutrient that  can promote  collagen production, and keratin, which is a  structural protein  found in hair.
Undeniable Beauty is gluten-free, NSF certified, and free of artificial flavors and sweeteners.
Nutrition per 2-gummy serving:  15 calories, 3 g carbs, 2 g added sugars, <1 g protein
Active ingredients:  L-theanine, melatonin, chamomile extract, passionflower extract, and lemon balm extract
Made with melatonin, L-theanine, and botanicals, Olly’s Sleep Blackberry Zen is designed to promote relaxation and support a healthy sleep cycle.
Studies  show that  melatonin  may be quite beneficial for improving sleep quality, especially in people with sleep disorders such as insomnia.
Some  research  also suggests that L-theanine may relieve stress, which could help support rest and relaxation. It may also improve sleep quality when combined with other ingredients, such as  GABA  or  magnesium .
While studies have shown an effective dose ranging from 200 to 400 milligrams (mg), Sleep Blackberry Zen contains only 100 mg of L-theanine per serving.
Additionally, as with other Olly supplements, Sleep Blackberry Zen’s effectiveness has not been studied.
Sleep Blackberry Zen is NSF-certified, gluten-free, and formulated without any artificial flavors or colors.
Nutrition per 1-gummy serving:  10 calories, 2 g carbs, 1 g added sugars
Included nutrients:  folate, biotin, pantothenic acid, choline, iodine, zinc,  Bacillus coagulans  MTCC 5856, and vitamins A, C, D, E, B6, and B12
This berry punch-flavored gummy provides a range of nutrients for kids ages 2 years and up, along with an added dose of  probiotics  to support gut health.
Specifically, it contains  Bacillus coagulans  MCTCC 5856, a probiotic strain that  may offer benefits  for people with digestive issues, though research in children is needed.
Olly’s Kids Multi + Probiotic is NSF certified, gluten-free, and naturally colored and flavored.

How much do Olly vitamins cost?
Olly’s products cost $9.99–$34.99 per bottle, depending on the product and number of servings provided. Discounts are available for subscriptions.
Shipping is free for orders over $59. The shipping cost for smaller orders depends on your delivery location.
Olly currently ships to all 50 U.S. states and Puerto Rico.
Keep in mind that pricing is current as of publication and is subject to change. Additionally, exact prices may vary by retailer.

Customer reviews and brand reputation
Olly has a solid reputation as a quality supplement manufacturer, and its products are available at a variety of retailers.
Olly is NSF-certified, and all supplements are tested by a third-party lab. Additionally, Olly does not make any unacceptable or unsubstantiated health claims about its products.
As of the time of publication, Olly is not accredited by the  Better Business Bureau (BBB)  and holds a C+ rating from the organization, which is based on factors such as the company’s complaint history and business practices.
In 2022, Olly was named in a  class-action lawsuit , which alleged that the company misled consumers by inaccurately dosing some supplements that contained melatonin.
Olly was also involved in a  2021 lawsuit  involving digital accessibility issues with its website.
In terms of customer satisfaction, many Olly products are highly rated. For example, the Ultra Strength Women’s Multi + Omega-3 has an average rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars on Amazon, which is based on 5,030 reviews.
Positive reviews state that the softgel version is easy to swallow and doesn’t have a strong flavor. A few also mention experiencing beneficial health effects with consistent use.
On the other hand, less favorable reviews report an unpleasant smell and aftertaste. Some also note that the packaging can be difficult to open.

Do Olly vitamins work?
Though Olly supplements have not been included in any research studies, most of the brand’s products are formulated using clinically studied ingredients.
On its website, the company provides information on the ingredients found in each supplement and the rationale for why each was included.
However, some of the supplements contain ingredients in lower doses than those used in clinical studies.
For example, the Probiotic + Prebiotic supplement contains 500 million CFUs of  B. coagulans  MCTCC 5856. Some research suggests that a dose of  at least 2 billion CFUs  may be more effective than lower doses in treating digestive issues.
Some other supplements may not have much of an effect unless you have a nutrient deficiency or are  lacking certain nutrients  in your diet.
For instance, supplements such as Ultra Strength Hair Softgels, Heavenly Hair, and Undeniable Beauty contain high doses of biotin, which are  unlikely to be beneficial  unless you have a deficiency.
Still, many of Olly’s other supplements and multivitamins can help round out your diet and boost your intake of important nutrients, which could benefit your health.

Potential concerns and side effects
Though Olly’s products are likely safe for most healthy adults, it’s important to talk with a healthcare professional before adding supplements to your routine, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking any medications.
Furthermore, note that Olly supplements are not a good fit for some people:
People following a vegan or vegetarian diet:  Most of Olly’s gummies contain animal-derived gelatin.
People following a very low carb diet:  Most Olly gummies contain 1–2 g of added sugar, which may not fit into a very low carb diet such as the  ketogenic diet .
People following a gluten-free diet:  While most Olly supplements are gluten-free and tested to verify that they are safe for those following a  gluten-free diet , some products, such as Beat the Bloat, may contain ingredients derived from wheat.
People with serious food allergies:  While the company notes that none of its gummies contain major allergens, it also states that its manufacturing facilities may process other products that contain these allergens. Although the company mentions that it regularly tests for cross-contamination, it’s best to use caution if you have a serious allergy.
