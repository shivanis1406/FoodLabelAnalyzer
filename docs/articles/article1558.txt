1–8. Grocery shopping tips
Once you’ve planned your meals and made your grocery list, stick to it.
It’s very easy to get sidetracked at the grocery store, which can lead to unintended purchases — and unintended expenses.
As a general rule, try to shop the perimeter (the outer edges) of the store first. This is where whole foods are generally placed and will make you more likely to fill your cart with them first.
The middle of the store often contains the most processed foods. If you find yourself in these aisles, look to the top or bottom of the shelves, rather than straight ahead. The most expensive items are usually placed at eye level.
Additionally, you can download a grocery list app to help you shop. Some of them can even save favorite items or share lists between multiple shoppers.
Using an app is also a great way to make sure you don’t forget your list at home.
Stick to your grocery list when you’re shopping. Shop the perimeter of the store first, since this is where the whole foods are generally located.
If you go to the grocery store while hungry, you’re more likely to stray from your grocery list and buy something on impulse.
When you’re hungry, you may often reach for processed foods that have fewer beneficial nutrients than whole foods. And since these generally aren’t on your list, they’re not good for your budget, either.
Try to eat a piece of fruit,  yogurt , or another nutritious snack before you go to the store. This way you won’t be hungry when you get there.
Shopping while hungry can lead to impulsive buying. If you’re hungry, have a snack before you go grocery shopping.
Some foods are more affordable in a less processed form. For example, a block of  cheese  is cheaper than shredded  cheese , and canned beans are less expensive than refried ones.
Whole grains, like  brown rice  and  oats , are also cheaper per serving than most processed cereals.
Less processed foods are also often sold in larger quantities and yield more servings per package, saving you money overall.
Whole foods are often less expensive than their processed counterparts. You can also buy them in larger quantities.
You might be surprised to see how much you’re paying for  highly processed foods  like:
soda
crackers
cookies
prepackaged meals
Despite the fact that they often lack beneficial nutrients and may be high in sodium or  added sugar , they’re also very expensive.
You can spend more of your budget on higher quality, nutrient-rich whole foods by skipping processed foods.
Avoid buying highly processed foods. Not only are they expensive, they often contain lots of sodium or sugar, with little to no nutritional value.
If you have favorite products or staples that you use frequently, you should stock up on them when they’re on sale.
If you’re sure that the item is something you’ll definitely use, you may as well buy it now to save a little money later. Just make sure that it will last a while and won’t expire. You won’t save any money if you buy something you’ll end up throwing out.
Stock up on staples and favorite products when they’re on sale. Just make sure that they won’t go bad in the meantime.
Local  produce  that’s in season is generally cheaper than out-of-season options. It’s also usually at its peak in both nutrients and flavor.
Produce that’s not in season has often been transported from far away to get to your store, which isn’t good for the environment or your budget.
Also, buy produce by the bag if you can. That’s usually a lot cheaper than buying by the piece.
If you buy more than you need, you can freeze the rest or incorporate it into next week’s  meal plans .
Produce that’s in season is typically cheaper and more nutritious. If you buy too much, freeze the rest or incorporate it into future meal plans.
Buying some foods in bulk quantities can save you a lot of money.
Grains, such as brown rice,  millet ,  barley , and oats, are all available in bulk. They also keep for a long time if you store them in airtight containers. This is also true for:
beans
lentils
some  nuts
dried fruit
These are all staple foods that are relatively inexpensive and can be used in a variety of nutritious meals.
Many foods are available in bulk for a way lower price. They keep for a long time in airtight containers and can be used in a variety of nutritious, inexpensive dishes.
Coupons are a great way to save some money — just be sure to use them wisely.
Sort out the good quality deals and stock up on cleaning products, nutrient-rich foods, and other staples that you’ll definitely use.
By cutting the cost of products needed around the house, you can spend more of your budget on nutritious foods.
Coupons may be a great way to stock up on cleaning products and nutrient-rich foods. Just make sure to avoid the coupons that involve processed foods.

9–14. Inexpensive alternatives
Most stores offer generic brands for nearly any product.
All food manufacturers must follow standards to provide safe food. Generic brands may be the same quality as other national brands, just less expensive.
That said, read the  ingredients list  to ensure that you’re not getting a product of lower quality than the national brand or one that contains unexpected added ingredients or allergens.
Most stores offer generic brands for many products. These are often of the same quality as more expensive national brands.
Fresh  meat  and  fish  can be quite expensive. However, you can get many cuts of meat that cost way less. Look for:
chuck steak
pork top sirloin steak
whole chicken
ground meat or poultry
These are great to use in burritos, casseroles, soups, stews, and stir-fries.
It may also be helpful to buy a large and inexpensive cut of meat to use in several different meals during the week.
Less expensive cuts of meat are great to use in casseroles, soups, stews, and burritos. These types of recipes usually make big meals and lots of leftovers.
There are several online retailers that offer nutritious foods for up to 50% cheaper than the grocery store.
By registering, you can access daily discounts and deals. The products are then delivered straight to your door.
Some online retailers focus exclusively on nutritious and  unprocessed foods . Buying as much as you can from these types of retailers can save you money.
Online retailers sometimes offer healthy foods for up to 50% cheaper than the supermarket and deliver them all the way to your doorstep.
Eating less meat may be a good way to save money.
Try having a couple of days per week where you use other  protein  sources, such as:
legumes
hemp seeds
eggs
canned fish
These are all very inexpensive, nutritious, and easy to prepare. Most of them also have a  long shelf life  and are, therefore, less likely to spoil quickly.
Try replacing meat 1 or 2 times per week with beans, legumes, eggs, or canned fish. These are all cheap and nutritious sources of protein.
Fresh  fruits ,  berries , and vegetables are usually in season for only a few months per year, and they’re sometimes rather expensive.
Quick-frozen produce is usually just as nutritious. It’s also cheaper, available all year, and usually sold in large bags.
Frozen produce is great to use for:
cooking
making  smoothies
toppings for  oatmeal  or yogurt
Plus, you gain the advantage of being able to take out only what you’re about to use. The rest will be kept safe from spoiling in the freezer.
Reducing produce waste is a great way to save money.
Frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables are usually just as nutritious as their fresh counterparts. They’re available all year round and are often sold in large bags.
Many foods are inexpensive and nutritious. By making some adjustments and using ingredients that you may not be used to, you can prepare many delicious and inexpensive meals.
Try increasing your use of:
eggs
beans
seeds
frozen fruits and  vegetables
cheaper cuts of meat
whole grains
These all taste great, are cheap (especially in bulk), and are very nutritious.
Incorporating more inexpensive yet nutrient-rich foods into your daily routine will help you save money and eat well.

15–19. At-home tips
When it comes to saving money at the grocery store, planning ahead is essential.
Pick one day each week to plan your meals for the upcoming week. Then, make a grocery list of everything you need to prepare those meals.
Make sure to also scan your fridge and cabinets to see what you already have. You may have foods hidden in the back that can be used, or you may want to plan your meals around foods you need to use before they expire.
Only plan to purchase what you know you’re going to use. This way, you won’t end up throwing away a lot of what you buy and don’t use.
Plan your meals for the week and make a grocery list. Only buy what you’re sure you will use, and check out what you already have in your cupboards first.
Cooking at home can be cheaper than  dining out . Generally, you can feed a family of four for the same price as buying food for one or two people at a restaurant.
So, make it a habit to cook at home, rather than deciding to eat out at the last minute.
Some people find it best to cook for the entire week on the weekends, while others cook one meal each day. By cooking for yourself, you also gain the benefit of knowing exactly what ingredients are in your meals.
Cooking at home can be much less expensive than eating out. Some find it best to cook for the entire week on weekends, while others like to cook one meal at a time.
Cooking large meals can save you both time and money.
Leftovers can be used for lunches or in other recipes. They can be reused in:
stews
stir-fries
salads
burritos
It’s great when you are on a budget because having leftovers can stop you from eating out on days when you don’t have time to cook a meal from scratch.
You can also freeze leftovers in single-portion sizes to enjoy at a later date.
Cook large meals from inexpensive ingredients, and use your leftovers during the following days.
If you can, it’s a great idea to grow your own produce or join a community garden.
Seeds are very cheap to buy. With some time and effort, you may be able to grow your own:
herbs
sprouts
tomatoes
onions
Having a continuous supply at home saves you money at the store.
Home-grown produce may also taste much better than store-bought varieties. You can guarantee that it’s organic and picked at peak ripeness.
With some time and effort, it’s easy to grow your own produce such as herbs, sprouts, tomatoes, and onions.
Eating out is very expensive, especially if you do it regularly.
Packing your lunch,  snacks , drinks, and other meals is less expensive than dining out. Plus, you’ll have complete control over the foods you eat and can choose options with lots of beneficial nutrients.
If you have adapted to cooking large meals at home (see tip 4), you’ll always have a steady lunch to bring with you, without any additional effort or cost.
This does require some planning, but it should save you a lot of money in the long term.
Packing your own lunch reduces the expense of eating out. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.

The takeaway
You don’t have to break the bank to eat well. In fact, there are many ways to eat nutrient-rich foods even on a very tight budget.
These include planning your meals, cooking at home, and making informed choices at the grocery store.
Also, keep in mind that highly processed foods cost you twice. This is because eating lots of  foods high in sodium  or sugar could lead to various health conditions.
These come with costs for care or medication and may mean you’re not able to work as much as you did previously.
Even if eating nutrient-rich foods was more expensive — though it doesn’t have to be — it would still be worth it down the line. You really can’t put a price on your health.
