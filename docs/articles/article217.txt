Title: The Vegetarian Diet: A Beginner's Guide and Meal Plan

Vegetarian diets may be associated with several health benefits and improved diet quality. However, proper planning is key to prevent nutritional deficiencies and negative effects on health.
The vegetarian diet has gained widespread popularity in recent years.
Some studies estimate that vegetarians account for around 6% and 5% of the population in North America and Europe, respectively, while about 19% of the population in Asia is vegetarian ( 1 ).
Apart from the ethical and environmental reasons for cutting meat from your diet, a well-planned vegetarian diet may also reduce your risk of chronic disease, support weight loss, and improve the quality of your diet.
This article provides a beginner’s guide to the vegetarian diet, including a sample meal plan for 1 week.

What is a vegetarian diet?
The vegetarian diet involves abstaining from eating meat, fish, and poultry.
People often adopt a vegetarian diet for religious or personal reasons, as well as ethical issues, such as animal rights.
Others decide to become vegetarian for environmental reasons, as livestock production increases greenhouse gas emissions, contributes to climate change, and requires large amounts of water, energy, and natural resources ( 2 ,  3 ).
There are several forms of vegetarianism, each of which differs in their restrictions.
The most common types include:
Lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet:  eliminates meat, fish, and poultry but allows eggs and dairy products
Lacto-vegetarian diet:  eliminates meat, fish, poultry, and eggs but allows  dairy products
Ovo-vegetarian diet:  eliminates meat, fish, poultry, and dairy products but allows  eggs
Pescatarian diet:  eliminates meat and poultry but allows fish and sometimes eggs and dairy products
Vegan diet:  eliminates meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and dairy products, as well as other animal-derived products, such as  honey
Flexitarian diet:  a mostly vegetarian diet that incorporates occasional meat, fish, or poultry
Most people who follow a vegetarian diet don’t eat meat, fish or poultry. Other variations involve the inclusion or exclusion of eggs, dairy, and other animal products.

Health benefits
Vegetarian diets are associated with a number of health benefits.
In fact, studies show that vegetarians tend to have better diet quality than meat-eaters and a higher intake of important nutrients like  fiber , vitamin C, vitamin E, and magnesium ( 4 ,  5 ).
A vegetarian diet may provide several other health boosts as well.
Switching to a vegetarian diet can be an effective strategy if you’re looking to  lose weight .
In fact, one review of 12 studies noted that vegetarians, on average, experienced 4.5 more pounds (2 kilograms) of weight loss over 18 weeks than non-vegetarians ( 6 ).
Similarly, a 6-month study in 74 people with type 2 diabetes demonstrated that vegetarian diets were nearly twice as effective at reducing body weight than  low calorie diets  ( 7 ).
Plus, a 2009 study in nearly 61,000 adults showed that vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index (BMI) than omnivores — BMI being a measurement of body fat based on height and weight ( 8 ).
However, more research is needed to understand which specific aspects of the vegetarian diet or lifestyle may be responsible for this association.
Some research suggests that a vegetarian diet may be linked to a  lower risk of cancer  — including those of the breast, colon, and rectum ( 9 ,  10 ).
However, current research is limited to observational studies, which cannot prove a cause-and-effect relationship. Keep in mind that some studies have turned up inconsistent findings ( 11 ,  12 ).
Therefore, more research is needed to understand how vegetarianism may impact cancer risk.
Several studies indicate that vegetarian diets may help maintain healthy blood sugar levels.
For instance, one 2014 review of six studies linked vegetarianism to improved blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes ( 13 ).
Vegetarian diets may also prevent diabetes by stabilizing  blood sugar levels  in the long term.
According to one study in 2,918 people, switching from a non-vegetarian to a vegetarian diet was associated with a 53% reduced risk of diabetes over an average of 5 years ( 14 ).
Vegetarian diets reduce several heart disease risk factors to help keep  your heart  healthy and strong.
One recent review found that vegan diets could lead to a small reduction in total cholesterol and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels, both of which are risk factors for heart disease ( 15 ).
However, the same review also found that vegan diets led to an increase in  triglycerides  and a reduction in HDL (good) cholesterol levels compared to other dietary interventions ( 15 ).
Similarly, another study in 118 people found that a low calorie vegetarian diet was more effective at reducing LDL (bad) cholesterol than a Mediterranean diet. On the other hand, the  Mediterranean diet  led to a greater reduction in triglyceride levels ( 16 ).
Other research indicates that vegetarianism may be associated with lower blood pressure levels. High blood pressure is another key risk factor for heart disease ( 17 ).
Still, research has turned up mixed results. Therefore, more studies are needed to determine whether vegetarian diets actually reduce the risk of developing or dying from heart disease ( 18 ,  19 ).
Not only do vegetarians tend to have a higher intake of several key nutrients, but vegetarianism has been associated with weight loss, reduced cancer risk, improved blood sugar, and better heart health. However, more research is needed.

Potential downsides
A well-rounded vegetarian diet can be healthy and nutritious.
However, it may also increase your risk of certain nutritional deficiencies.
Meat, poultry and fish supply a good amount of protein and  omega-3 fatty acids , as well as micronutrients like zinc, selenium, iron, and vitamin B12 ( 20 ).
Other animal products like dairy and eggs also contain plenty of  calcium , vitamin D, and B vitamins ( 21 ,  22 ).
When cutting meat or other animal products from your diet, it’s important to ensure you’re getting these essential nutrients from other sources.
Studies show that vegetarians are at a higher risk of protein, calcium, iron,  iodine , and vitamin B12 deficiencies ( 23 ,  24 ,  25 ,  26 ).
A nutritional deficiency in these  key micronutrients  can lead to symptoms like fatigue, weakness, anemia, bone loss, and thyroid issues ( 27 ,  28 ,  29 ,  30 ).
Including a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, protein sources, and  fortified foods  is an easy way to ensure you’re getting appropriate nutrition.
Multivitamins and supplements are another option to quickly bump up your intake and compensate for potential deficiencies.
Cutting out meat and animal-based products can increase your risk of nutritional deficiencies. A well-balanced diet — possibly alongside supplements — can help prevent deficiencies.

Foods to eat
A vegetarian diet should include a diverse mix of fruits, vegetables, grains, healthy fats, and proteins.
To replace the protein provided by meat in your diet, include a variety of  protein-rich plant foods  like whole grains, legumes, tempeh, tofu, and seitan.
If you follow a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, eggs and dairy can also boost your protein intake.
Eating  nutrient-dense whole foods  like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains will supply a range of important vitamins and minerals to fill in any nutritional gaps in your diet.
A few healthy foods to eat on a vegetarian diet are:
Fruits:  apples,  bananas , berries, oranges, melons, pears, peaches
Vegetables:  leafy greens, asparagus, broccoli, tomatoes, carrots
Grains:  quinoa, barley, buckwheat, rice, oats
Legumes:  lentils, beans, peas,  chickpeas
Nuts:  almonds, walnuts, cashews, chestnuts
Seeds:  flaxseed, chia, and hemp seeds
Healthy fats:  olive oil, avocados
Proteins:  tempeh, tofu, seitan, natto,  nutritional yeast , spirulina, eggs, dairy products
A healthy vegetarian diet includes a variety of nutritious foods like fruits, vegetables, grains, healthy fats, and plant-based proteins.

Foods to avoid
There are many variations of vegetarianism, each with different restrictions.
Lacto-ovo vegetarianism, the most common type of vegetarian diet, involves eliminating all meat, poultry, and fish.
Other types of vegetarians may also avoid foods like eggs and dairy.
A  vegan diet  is the most restrictive form of vegetarianism because it bars meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, and any other animal products.
Depending on your needs and preferences, you may have to avoid the following foods on a vegetarian diet:
Meat:  beef, veal, and pork
Poultry:  chicken and turkey
Fish and shellfish:  This restriction does not apply to  pescatarians .
Meat-based ingredients:  gelatin, lard, carmine, isinglass, oleic acid, and suet
Eggs:  This restriction applies to vegans and lacto-vegetarians.
Dairy products:  This restriction on milk, yogurt, and cheese applies to vegans and ovo-vegetarians.
Other animal products:  Vegans may choose to avoid honey, beeswax, and pollen.
Most vegetarians avoid meat, poultry, and fish. Certain variations of vegetarianism may also restrict eggs, dairy, and other animal products.

Sample meal plan
To help get you started, here’s a 1-week sample meal plan for a  lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet .
Breakfast:  oatmeal with fruit, nut butter, flaxseed, and a glass of soy milk
Lunch:  grilled veggie and  hummus  wrap on a whole-grain tortilla with lentil salad
Dinner:  tofu banh mi sandwich with pickled slaw

Above is a sample menu of what one week on a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet may look like. This plan can be adjusted for other styles of vegetarianism as well.

The bottom line
Most vegetarians avoid meat, poultry, and fish, though some also restrict eggs, dairy, and other animal products.
A balanced vegetarian diet with nutritious foods like produce, grains, healthy fats, and plant-based protein may offer several benefits, but it may increase your risk of  nutritional deficiencies  if poorly planned.
Be sure to pay close attention to a few key nutrients and round out your diet with a variety of healthy whole foods. That way, you’ll enjoy the benefits of vegetarianism while  minimizing the side effects .
