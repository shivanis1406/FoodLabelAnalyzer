Title: Multiple Sclerosis and Diet: All You Need to Know

There are no official dietary guidelines for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, eating an overall nutrient-rich, well-balanced diet can help reduce inflammation and improve overall health. Read on to learn more about foods to eat and foods to limit or avoid.

What is MS?
Multiple sclerosis (MS)  is an autoimmune disorder that gradually destroys the protective coverings that wrap around your nerve fibers. These coverings are called myelin sheaths.
Over time, this disease can  permanently damage  your nerves, affecting nerve communication in the brain and spinal cord.
Symptoms of MS include:
fatigue
tingling
bladder dysfunction
movement difficulties and spasticity
impaired vision
brain fog
MS is highly complex, and the way the disease progresses varies from person to person.  Recent research  has linked infection with the  Epstein-Barr virus  as a contributing trigger of MS, but a cure remains to be found.
Although diet cannot cure MS, some  research  suggests that making dietary changes can help improve health and reduce inflammation. A balanced diet can make you stronger and healthier, reducing the effects of MS.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological condition that gradually destroys the protective coverings called myelin sheaths that wrap around your nerve fibers. A cure hasn’t been discovered yet, but diet can help improve health and reduce inflammation.

How does diet affect MS?
Currently, there are no official dietary guidelines, or evidence of any specific diet or dietary pattern, for people with MS.
That’s why any dietary guidelines and recommendations for people with MS should aim to improve overall health.
Diet may help with MS in several ways,  including :
preventing or controlling its progression
reducing flare-ups
Ideally, an MS-friendly diet is:
high in antioxidants to curb inflammation
high in fiber to aid bowel movements
adequate in calcium and vitamin D to address osteoporosis
high in vitamins and minerals to relieve fatigue and promote wellness
An MS-friendly diet limits foods that have been  linked to chronic inflammation  and other negative health effects, or those that simply make day-to-day activities more difficult for someone with MS. For example, avoiding ultra-processed foods is recommended, as they are known to  cause disease in general .
A  2019 study  involving 20 adults with MS found that certain nutrients, including fish oil, B vitamins, N-acetylcysteine, and CoQ10, may benefit people with mild to moderate MS, potentially leading to better general functioning as well as an improved quality of life and mobility.
The nutrients associated with these positive changes included increased:
fat
cholesterol
folate
iron
magnesium
Decreased carb intake appeared to be beneficial.
There’s also  preliminary evidence  that people with MS are more likely to have deficiencies in some nutrients, including vitamins A, B12, and D3. Researchers suggest that taking certain vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, antioxidants, plant compounds, and melatonin may help improve some symptoms.
Scientists need to do more research before making official recommendations about many of the dietary patterns discussed here.
There are no official dietary guidelines for MS. While diet cannot cure MS, making certain dietary changes may improve overall health.

Foods to eat
Here is a list of foods to include in an MS-friendly diet:
Fruits and vegetables:  all fresh fruits and vegetables
Grains:  all grains, such as oats, rice, and quinoa
Nuts and seeds:  all nuts and seeds
Fish:  all fish, especially fresh fish and fatty oily fish, such as salmon and mackerel, as they’re high in  omega-3 fatty acids  and vitamin D
Meats:  all fresh meats, such as beef, chicken, lamb, and more, especially beef liver, which is particularly high in vitamin D and biotin
Eggs:  good source of biotin, vitamin D, and other important nutrients
Dairy products:  such as milk, cheese, yogurt, and butter
Fats:  healthy fats, such as olive, flax seed, coconut, and avocado oils
Probiotic-rich foods:  such as yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi
Beverages:  water, herbal teas
Herbs and spices:  all fresh herbs and spices
In short, the guidelines for an MS-friendly diet are similar to an overall nutrient-rich, well-balanced diet.
That’s because plant-based foods and grains are higher in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and fluid, which can help with MS symptoms, such as constipation.
They’re also higher in compounds that function as antioxidants, which are molecules that  help defend  your cells against free radical damage and inflammation. These compounds  may help  fight inflammation and potentially slow MS progression.
Fatty fish such as salmon and mackerel may be beneficial for MS. They are high in omega-3 fatty acids, which  reduce  the relapsing rate and inflammatory markers in MS.
They’re also high in vitamin D, which can  help keep  your bones strong when combined with calcium. People with MS also have a higher likelihood of vitamin D deficiency.
Research  on the effects of red meat and saturated fat intakes on MS symptoms shows mixed results.
Dairy products also show mixed results. In  some studies , dairy products were linked to disease activity. However, they’re a good source of calcium, vitamin D, vitamin A, and potassium, so you can try including them in moderation in an MS-friendly diet.
Talk with your doctor if you believe dairy products are worsening your MS symptoms.
Eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, grains, and fish may help improve health for people with MS. A person with MS can eat red meat and dairy in moderation, as current research on their effects is mixed.

Foods to limit or avoid
While an MS-friendly diet allows plenty of options, there are still some food groups you can limit or avoid to help manage MS symptoms.
Most of these foods are  linked to chronic inflammation . They include processed meats, refined carbs, trans fats, and sugar-sweetened beverages, just to name a few.
Here’s a list of foods to consider limiting or avoiding if you have MS:
Processed meats:  sausages, bacon, canned meats, and meats that are salted, smoked, or cured
Refined carbs:  white bread, pasta, biscuits, and flour tortillas
Fried foods:  french fries, fried chicken, mozzarella sticks, and doughnuts
Highly processed foods:  fast food, potato chips, and convenience and frozen meals
Trans fats:  margarine, shortening, and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils
Sugar-sweetened beverages:  energy and sports drinks, soda, and sweet tea
Alcohol:   limit consumption  of all alcoholic beverages as much as possible
An MS-friendly diet is similar to a diet focused on promoting overall health and well-being. It limits or avoids some foods, such as processed meats, refined carbs, and trans fats. These foods do not help manage MS symptoms and may worsen inflammation.

Specialty diets
Several diets specifically aim to help slow progression and prevent flare-ups of MS. They include the Swank diet and variations of the Wahls diet. These diets are popular within the MS community.
Before starting any diet, especially ones that restrict food groups, talk with your doctor. Your doctor can help you decide whether starting a diet is right for you and can make sure that you are getting the nutrients you need.
The  Swank diet  for MS is a low fat, low saturated fat eating pattern that neurologist Dr. Roy Swank, MD, PhD,  developed  in 1948. Its recommendations include:
avoid processed foods that contain saturated fat or hydrogenated oils
limit saturated fat to 15 grams per day; consume no more than 20 to 50 grams per day of unsaturated fats
avoid red meat for 1 year, then limit red meat to 3 ounces per week
avoid dark meat poultry and limit fatty fish to 50 grams per day
choose only dairy with 1% fat or less
avoid egg yolks
consume as many fruits and vegetables as you want
enjoy whole grain breads, rice, and pastas
snack on nuts and seeds daily
consume 1 teaspoon of cod liver oil and a multivitamin and mineral supplement daily
However, a  2019 review  on the effectiveness of the Swank diet is limited to a series of reports Dr. Swank published.
The reports follow a group of individuals with relapsing-remitting MS who adhered to the Swank low fat diet for 50 years. Swank assessed individuals for compliance with the diet, frequency and severity of MS attacks, and performance status (e.g., wheelchair use, ability to walk, and ability to work).
Those who adhered to the diet (consumed 20 grams of fat or less) had fewer and less severe MS-related exacerbations than those who consumed greater than 20 grams of fat.
Individuals with lower performance status at the start of the observation period or who were in the progressive phase of MS were likely to experience continued decline, even if they complied with the Swank diet.
While Swank’s studies had a long follow-up duration and large cohort size, they were not randomized controlled trials and were subject to several forms of bias.
Larger, better-designed studies are needed to determine whether the Swank diet can help improve symptoms or delay the progression of MS.
Dr. Terry Wahls developed the modified paleolithic Wahls diet for managing MS in 2008.
Some evidence  suggests that a modified  paleolithic diet  and taking supplements may help improve perceived fatigue in people with MS.
The Wahls diet is a version of the paleolithic (paleo) diet. The paleo diet promotes eating:
meat
fish
eggs
vegetables
fruits
nuts
seeds
herbs
spices
healthy fats
oils
On the other hand, the paleo diet avoids:
processed foods
sugar
grains
most dairy products
legumes
artificial sweeteners
vegetable oils
margarine
trans fats
The modified paleo Wahls diet makes the following  recommendations  beyond the general paleo diet:
eat 9 or more cups of fruits and vegetables daily (3 cups each of green leafy vegetables, sulfur-rich vegetables, and intensely colored fruits or vegetables)
emphasize consumption of seaweed, algae, and nutritional yeast
consume limited servings of gluten-free grains and legumes
avoid eggs
consume lower meat and fish intake than the paleo diet
According to a  2021 analysis , the diet is effective in reducing symptoms of fatigue and improving quality of life in MS.
Dr. Wahls developed the Wahls elimination diet in 2015. It  recommends  avoiding all grains (including gluten-free ones), legumes, and nightshades (including tomatoes, white potatoes, eggplant, peppers, and seed spices) to reduce lectin in the diet.
It also recommends avoiding all dairy and allows for unlimited consumption of saturated fat.
Like the modified paleo Wahls diet, the Wahls elimination diet recommends at least 9 cups of fruits and vegetables daily as well as seaweed, nutritional yeast, and fermented foods.
A  2021 study  with 77 people with relapsing-remitting MS found that the Wahls elimination diet was associated with an increased quality of life and decreased fatigue. Another  analysis  of that study found that the diet improved anxiety and depression scores in participants.
However, much of the existing research, including the studies linked here, on the effectiveness of the Wahls diet involves Dr. Wahls. More research without the potential for bias is needed to explore this diet for MS.
It’s also important to note that diets that exclude whole food groups (like grains and dairy in the Wahls elimination diet) increase the chance of nutritional insufficiency. Taking supplements under a doctor’s supervision when on these diets can help reduce the risk of nutritional deficiency.
Both the Swank diet and Wahls elimination diet were developed to slow progression and prevent flare-ups of MS.  Research on the effectiveness of these diets for MS is promising, but more well-designed research is needed.  Keep in mind that any diet that eliminates whole food groups (like the Wahls elimination diet) increases the risk of nutritional insufficiency. Talk with your doctor before starting any diet, especially ones that restrict whole food groups.

Other diets
A  2022 study  examining whether ketogenic diets may help improve symptoms in people with MS did not have promising results. However, this research is ongoing, and scientists need to further investigate the role of diet in MS.
The ketogenic diet is considered in MS research because it’s high in fat and low in carbohydrates. Since myelin is a lipid-based (fat) substance, some research has focused on whether a high fat diet could help restore myelin. However, current results are not reflecting this prediction.
And since it is restrictive, a ketogenic diet can be difficult to follow. Moreover, it restricts food groups that are recommended in an overall balanced diet.
Clinical trials  investigating the effects of ketogenic diets and intermittent fasting on MS are currently underway.
A  2022 meta-analysis  found that fast-mimicking diets, or a dietary pattern that involves periodic cycles of low calorie intake, and ketogenic diets have not shown effects on relapsing-remitting MS.
Still, researchers suggest that more large, prospective clinical studies are needed.
In a  2019 study , researchers gave people with MS a ketogenic diet that restricted carbohydrate intake to fewer than 20 grams per day for 6 months. They found that the diet helped improve fatigue and depression, promoted fat loss, and reduced inflammatory markers.
However, this study included 19 people, and only 15 remained in the study for the full 6 months. Thus, more large studies are needed.

Diet tips to help with MS
In addition to the diet guidelines in this article, people with MS may want to consider the following food tips to help manage their symptoms.
Make sure you eat enough food:  Eating too few calories can cause fatigue.
Prep your meals in advance:  If you have time, batch-making meals can help you save energy later. If you’re often fatigued, this can be especially helpful.
Rearrange your kitchen:  Place food, utensils, and other equipment in areas that are close by and easy for you to clean up. This will help you save energy.
Try “ready-to-use” items:  Buying precut fruits and veggies can help you shave minutes off cooking time and make cooking simpler.
Make thicker drinks:  If you have difficulty swallowing, preparing thicker beverages like a nutrient-rich smoothie may be easier to manage.
Soft foods may help:  If chewing too much is making you fatigued, try choosing softer foods like baked fish, bananas, avocado, and cooked veggies.
Limit crumbly foods:  If you have difficulty swallowing or find yourself choking on food often, consider limiting foods that crumble, such as toast and crackers.
Reach out for help:  Even if you do not like asking for help, having members of your support network help with small tasks, like preparing meals, cleaning, or setting the table, can help ease your fatigue.
Stay active:  Although exercise can make a person with MS feel fatigued, it’s especially important for helping achieve and manage optimal health and a moderate weight. It’s also important for preventing osteoporosis, which is more common among people with MS.
If you have other MS-related concerns not addressed above, it’s important to notify your healthcare team. They can offer personalized tips to help you manage your symptoms better.
The tips listed in this section can help improve your quality of life with MS by helping you maintain a moderate weight and manage symptoms like fatigue and swallowing issues. If you have other concerns, contact your healthcare team.
