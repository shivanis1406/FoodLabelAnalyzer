“Factor’s meals had the best texture out of all of the prepared meal delivery services I’ve tried, and the flavors were spot-on as well. The seasonings and sauces really made the dishes stand out .
“The meals are easy to reheat, and I liked having them on hand for quick lunches.”

“Overall, Trifecta’s meals kept their flavor and texture well after reheating. I also found each meal to be filling enough for a main course and nutritious.
“That said, I did add some extra seasonings and vegetables to some dishes to boost their flavor profile.
“Trifecta also offers several plans for different dietary needs and allows you to choose your own meals, making it a good choice for those with dietary restrictions.”

“I didn’t expect to like this as much as I did.  The variety of meals is good, with chicken, beef, and fish options as well as plant-based proteins. Meals included those that had less or no grains and there were filters for “low-carb” and “keto” to make them easier to find.
“The meals looked fresh and smelled appealing. I liked the flavors of each and I didn’t feel the need to add anything.
“I would recommend Territory Foods. I think it’s especially helpful for individuals or couples, both those living on their own or who might have different needs for their diet than the rest of their household. For example, if someone is trying to eat low carb but they are also catering to the wants and needs of small children, teenagers, and others who eat differently than they do.
If you can afford it, this can be a good way to have variety in meals, stick to dietary preferences or needs, and not add additional work or food prep.”

Read our full review of Snap Kitchen.
“The meals I tried were as described on the website. While the serving sizes were appropriate for me, my larger husband still felt hungry and unsatisfied after eating some of the dishes.
“As a dietitian, I prioritize eating produce with my meals, and I didn’t feel that these meals included sufficient quantities of vegetables. Most dishes contained some vegetables, but in my professional opinion, they didn’t provide enough to count as a  standard vegetable serving .
“Many dishes were a tad spicy for my taste. However, my husband said they tasted great to him. For those who enjoy more spice, these dishes may be a good fit in terms of flavor.
“For the price, I would expect to get more food in each meal. But, they were easy to enjoy and I appreciate how quickly they are able to be consumed. There are many options for people following low carb or Paleo diets.
“For people who want more produce and plant-based meals, this might not be the best fit.”
— Lauren Manaker, MS, RDN, Healthline writer

What to consider in a meal prep delivery service
Jessica Isaacs , a sports dietitian and the owner of Jessica the Sports RD, emphasizes that not all meal delivery services are created equal, so it’s important to find a service that fits your  fitness goals .
“Some services are targeted toward an athletic population, with  macronutrients  in line with what a highly active person may need, where others are geared more toward a less active population looking to  lose weight ,” Isaacs says.
“Everyone’s individual calorie and macronutrient needs will vary depending on body size, goals, training, and other factors.”
For bodybuilders, getting enough protein is a key concern. Try to opt for a high protein meal delivery service.
“Generally, for someone with the goal of building or  maintaining muscle , I like to see meals that provide at least 25 g of protein per meal and have the option to increase the protein portion as needed,” she adds.
Some other factors to consider:
menus that support allergen and dietary restrictions
meal variety
delivery area
cost, including shipping fees

But a premade meal delivery service is even more convenient and time-saving.
