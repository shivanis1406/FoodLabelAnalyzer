Title: The 6 Best Teas to Lose Weight and Belly Fat

Many varieties of tea contain beneficial compounds like flavones and catechins, which could support weight loss and fat loss.
Tea is a beverage enjoyed around the world.
You can make it by pouring hot water onto tea leaves and allowing them to steep for several minutes so their flavor infuses into the water.
This aromatic beverage is most commonly made from the leaves of  Camellia sinensis , a type of evergreen shrub native to Asia ( 1 ).
Drinking tea has been associated with many health benefits, including reducing the risk of heart disease and cancer ( 2 ,  3 ).
Some studies have even found that tea may enhance weight loss and help reduce belly fat. Certain types have been found to be more effective than others at achieving this.
Below are 6 of the best teas for increasing weight loss and decreasing body fat.

1. Green tea
Green tea is one of the most well-known types of tea, and is linked with many health benefits.
It’s also one of the most effective teas for  weight loss . There is substantial evidence linking green tea to decreases in both weight and body fat.
According to one review of 11 studies, green tea could help reduce body weight, body mass index (BMI), and belly fat in people with type 2 diabetes ( 4 ).
The review also noted that the beneficial effects of green tea were observed at doses lower than 800 milligrams (mg) per day in studies lasting 8 weeks or longer ( 4 ).
It’s believed that catechins — which are naturally occurring antioxidants found in  green tea  — could help increase metabolism and fat burning, resulting in weight loss ( 5 ).
This same effect also applies to  matcha , a highly concentrated type of powdered green tea that contains the same beneficial ingredients as regular green tea ( 6 ).
Green tea is high in a type of antioxidants called catechins and has been associated with weight loss and fat loss.

2. Puerh tea
Also known as pu’er or pu-erh tea, puerh tea is a type of Chinese black tea that has been fermented.
It is often enjoyed after a meal, and has an earthy aroma that tends to develop the longer it’s stored.
Some animal studies have shown that  puerh tea  may help lower blood sugar and regulate fatty acid metabolism ( 7 ,  8 ).
Other evidence suggests that it may also support weight loss. In fact, one study found that daily consumption of puerh tea was associated with reductions in body weight, BMI,  triglycerides , and cholesterol levels ( 9 ).
In another 2014 study, 70 males were given either a capsule of puerh tea extract or a placebo. After 3 months, those taking the puerh tea capsule lost approximately 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram) more than the placebo group ( 10 ).
Some studies have found that puerh tea and puerh tea extract may help enhance weight loss while also lowering both blood sugar levels.

3. Black tea
Black tea  is a type of tea that has undergone more oxidation than other types, such as green, white, or oolong teas.
Oxidation is a chemical reaction that happens when the tea leaves are exposed to the air, resulting in browning that causes the characteristic dark color of black tea ( 11 ).
There are many different types and blends of black tea available, including popular varieties like Earl Grey and English breakfast.
Several studies have found that black tea could be effective when it comes to weight control.
One 2014 study of 111 people found that drinking 3 cups of powdered black tea each day for 3 months significantly increased weight loss and reduced waist circumference, compared to drinking a caffeine-matched control beverage ( 12 ).
Some theorize that black tea’s potential weight loss effects may be because it’s high in  polyphenols  and flavones, a type of plant pigment with antioxidant properties.
These compounds are thought to promote weight loss by reducing calorie absorption, promoting  fat metabolism , and decreasing oxidative stress ( 13 ).
One older study followed 4,280 adults over 14 years. It found that those with a higher flavone intake from foods and beverages like  black tea  experienced a smaller increase in BMI than those with a lower flavone intake ( 14 ).
However, note that this study looks only at the association between BMI and flavone intake. Further research is needed to account for other factors that may be involved.
Black tea is high in flavones and has been associated with reductions in weight, BMI, and waist circumference.

4. Oolong tea
Oolong tea  is a traditional Chinese tea that has been partially oxidized, putting it somewhere between green tea and black tea in terms of oxidation and color.
It is often described as having a fruity, fragrant aroma and a unique flavor, though these can vary significantly depending on the level of oxidation.
Several studies have shown that oolong tea could help enhance weight loss by improving fat burning and  speeding up metabolism .
In one older study, 102 people with overweight or obesity drank oolong tea every day for 6 weeks, which may have helped reduce both their body weight and body fat. The researchers proposed the tea did this by improving the metabolism of fat in the body ( 15 ).
Another study found that drinking oolong tea twice daily for 14 days increased fat burning by 20%, which could theoretically lead to weight loss ( 16 ).
While more studies on the effects of oolong tea are needed, these findings show that oolong could be potentially beneficial for  weight loss .
Studies show that oolong tea may help reduce weight and body fat by increasing metabolism and improving fat burning.

5. White tea
White tea stands out among other types of tea because it is minimally processed and is harvested while the tea plant is still young.
White tea  has a distinct flavor very different from other types of tea. It tastes subtle, delicate, and slightly sweet.
The benefits of white tea are well-studied, and range from improving oral health to killing cancer cells in some test-tube studies ( 17 ,  18 ).
Though further research is needed, white tea could also help when it comes to losing weight and body fat.
Studies show that white tea is rich in catechins, which may help enhance  weight loss  ( 5 ,  19 ).
Furthermore, one animal study showed that white tea extract could reduce fat gain in mice on a high fat diet by boosting metabolism, increasing the breakdown of fat cells, and preventing the formation of new ones ( 20 ).
However, keep in mind that more research is needed to understand how the effects of white tea may apply to humans and to confirm the potential beneficial effects of white tea when it comes to fat loss.
One test-tube study found that white tea extract may increase fat loss. However, not much research in humans currently exists, and more is needed.

6. Herbal tea
Herbal teas involve the infusion of herbs, spices, and fruits in hot water.
They differ from traditional teas because they do not typically contain  caffeine , and are not made from the leaves of  Camellia sinensis .
Popular herbal tea varieties include  rooibos tea , ginger tea, rosehip tea, and hibiscus tea.
Although the ingredients and formulations of  herbal teas  can vary significantly, some studies have found that herbal teas may help with weight reduction and fat loss.
One animal study found that high doses of hibiscus tea reduced BMI and could protect against obesity and oxidative stress in rats fed a high sugar diet ( 21 ).
Rooibos tea is another type of herbal tea that may be especially effective when it comes to fat burning.
In fact, a 2014 test-tube study showed that rooibos tea increased fat metabolism and helped block the formation of fat cells ( 22 ).
However, further studies in humans are needed to look into the effects of herbal teas like rooibos on weight loss.
Though research is limited, some studies have found that herbal teas, including rooibos tea and hibiscus tea, may help reduce weight and increase fat loss.

The bottom line
Though many people  drink tea  solely for its soothing quality and delicious taste, each cup may also pack many health benefits.
Replacing high calorie beverages like juice or soda with tea could help reduce overall calorie intake and lead to weight loss.
Some animal and test-tube studies have also shown that certain types of tea may help increase weight loss while blocking fat cell formation. However, studies in humans are needed to investigate this further.
Additionally, many types of tea are especially high in beneficial compounds like flavones and catechins, which could aid in weight loss as well.
Coupled with a healthy diet and regular exercise, a cup or two of tea each day could help you boost weight loss and prevent harmful  belly fat .
