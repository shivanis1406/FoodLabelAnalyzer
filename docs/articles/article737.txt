Title: 15 Healthy Recipes You Can Cook with Your Kids

With many schools now closed due to the current COVID-19 outbreak, you may be looking for activities to keep your children active, engaged, and entertained.
Although numerous activities can keep kids busy, cooking is one of the best choices, as it’s both fun and educational.
Cooking may help develop their problem-solving and hand-eye coordination skills, increase confidence, and even improve diet quality by encouraging fruit and veggie intake ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
Yet, it’s important to choose age-appropriate recipes and assign kitchen tasks that are safe for your child to tackle.
For example, very young children can help by washing vegetables, stirring ingredients, and cutting out shapes with cookie cutters while older children can take on more complex tasks, such as chopping and peeling.
Here are 15 healthy recipes that you can make with your kids.

1. Overnight oats
Overnight oats are an oatmeal dish that you prepare ahead and refrigerate overnight — with no cooking required.
Not only can pre-making nutritious breakfast options save you time, but choosing dishes that children can make themselves may also help your kids get excited about preparing healthy food.
Overnight oats are simple and appropriate for all ages. Plus, they’re easy to individualize, allowing kids to be creative and try out different nutrient-dense toppings like  berries , nuts, coconut, and seeds.

Have your children mash the bananas, measure ingredients, and fold the chocolate chips into the batter. Once it’s out of the oven, they can top their slices with nut butter for a boost of protein.

4. Ants on a log
Ants on a log, which combines crunchy celery, smooth or chunky nut butter, and sweet, chewy raisins, is a classic snack for many kids.
