Title: 24 Healthy Vegan Snack Ideas



Coming up with healthy snack ideas that fit a vegan diet can be challenging.
This is because the vegan diet includes only plant foods and excludes all animal products, limiting the selection of snack foods.
Luckily, countless combinations of plant foods can make up healthy and satisfying snacks — whether you eat fully vegan or are simply interested in reducing animal products in your diet.
Here are 24 healthy vegan snacks that are both tasty and nutritious.

1. Fruit and Nut Butter
Fruit and nut butter, made from blended nuts, is a delicious vegan snack with many nutritional benefits.
Fruits provide fiber, vitamins and minerals, while nut butters are rich in fiber and protein that can help you feel full and energized ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
Popular combinations include bananas or  apples  with cashew, almond or  peanut butter .
For the most nutritional benefits, make sure to select a nut butter without added sugar, oil or salt.

2. Guacamole and Crackers
Guacamole is a vegan dip usually made from  avocado , onion, garlic and lime juice.
It is very healthy and contains many beneficial nutrients. For example, avocados are an excellent source of  monounsaturated fats , fiber and potassium — all of which may promote heart health ( 4 ,  5 ).
You can prepare your own guacamole or purchase a premade version without added salt or sugar. Choose 100% whole-grain crackers to pair with guacamole for a healthy vegan snack.

3. Edamame With Sea Salt
Edamame is the name for immature soybeans in their pod.
They’re an excellent source of high-quality plant protein. One cup (155 grams) provides close to 17 grams of protein for less than 200 calories ( 6 ,  7 ).
You can prepare  edamame  by boiling or steaming the pods or by thawing them in your microwave. Sprinkle the warm pods with a little  sea salt  or soy sauce before chewing on them gently to eat the beans inside.

4. Trail Mix
Trail mix is a plant-based snack that typically includes nuts, seeds and dried fruit. Some varieties also have chocolate, coconut, crackers or  whole grains .
Depending on the ingredients, trail mix can be a good source of protein, healthy fats and fiber ( 8 ).
However, some varieties may not be vegan or may contain  added sugar , salt and oil. To avoid these ingredients, you can easily make your own trail mix by combining your favorite plant-based ingredients.

5. Roasted Chickpeas
Chickpeas, also known as garbanzo beans, are spherical and slightly yellow legumes.
One cup (164 grams) of  chickpeas  provides over 14 grams of protein and 71% of the daily value (DV) for folate. They’re also high in iron, copper,  manganese , phosphorus and magnesium ( 9 ).
Roasted chickpeas are a delicious vegan snack. You can make your own by tossing canned chickpeas in olive oil and seasonings, spreading them on a baking sheet and baking them for 40 minutes or until crunchy at 450°F (230°C).

6. Fruit Leather
Fruit leather is made from fruit puree that has been thinly flattened, dried and sliced.
It has similar nutrients to the fresh fruit from which it is made and is usually high in  fiber , vitamins and minerals. However, some packaged fruit leathers have added sugar or color and are not as nutritious as homemade varieties ( 10 ).
To make your own, puree fruits of your choice and mix with lemon juice and  maple syrup  if preferred. Spread the puree in a thin layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and dry it in a dehydrator or in your oven at 140°F (60°C) for approximately six hours.

7. Rice Cakes and Avocado
Rice cakes are a snack food similar to crackers. They’re made from puffed rice that has been packed together and shaped into circles.
The most nutritious rice cakes are made from whole-grain  brown rice  and contain few other ingredients. Two brown rice cakes provide 14 grams of carbs for less than 70 calories ( 11 ).
Rice cakes topped with avocado is a balanced vegan snack with both healthy fats and fiber. You can sprinkle the rice cakes with toasted sesame seeds for extra crunch and flavor.

8. Hummus and Veggies
Hummus  is a vegan dip made from chickpeas, oil, lemon juice, garlic and a sesame seed paste called tahini.
It is high in fiber, healthy fats, B vitamins and vitamin C. Homemade versions are generally more nutritious than commercially prepared hummus that may have added vegetable oils and preservatives ( 12 ,  13 ).
You can pair homemade or store-bought hummus with carrot, celery, cucumber, radishes and other raw vegetables for a healthy and crunchy vegan snack.

9. Fruit and Veggie Smoothies
Smoothies are an excellent on-the-go snack for vegans.
Popular smoothie ingredients include fruits and veggies, which are rich in vitamins and minerals. You can easily make your own smoothie by blending  plant-based milk  or water with your favorite fruits and vegetables, including bananas, berries, spinach and kale.
If you follow a vegan diet, consider adding a scoop of flax or  chia seeds  that provide important omega-3 fatty acids that some vegan diets lack ( 14 ,  15 ).

10. Oatmeal With Fruit, Nuts or Seeds
Oatmeal is made by heating oats with liquid. It’s commonly eaten as a breakfast food but can be enjoyed at any time of the day for a quick and healthy vegan snack.
It’s high in fiber, iron, magnesium and several other vitamins and minerals. Cooking oatmeal with unsweetened almond milk and adding sliced fruit and nuts or seeds can boost the nutrient content ( 16 ).
The healthiest way to prepare  oatmeal  is to make your own or choose instant options without added sugars or salt.

11. Salsa and Homemade Tortilla Chips
Salsa is typically made from chopped tomatoes, onions, lime juice, salt and seasonings.
It’s rich in vitamin C, potassium and the beneficial plant compound lycopene from the tomatoes. High intakes of  lycopene  have been linked to a lower risk of heart disease ( 17 ,  18 ).
Salsa is commonly eaten with tortilla chips, but store-bought chips are often made with vegetable oil and excess salt. To make your own, simply slice a few tortillas, brush them with olive oil and bake for 15 minutes at 350°F (175°C).

12. Popcorn With Nutritional Yeast
Popcorn  is made by heating dried corn kernels. It can be prepared in an air popper, microwave or a kettle with oil on the stove.
When popcorn is made in an air popper, it can be a highly nutritious vegan snack. A two-cup serving (16 grams) has close to 10% of the DV for fiber at only 62 calories ( 19 ).
Adding  nutritional yeast  can boost the nutrition of popcorn even more. This flakey yellow yeast is a high-quality plant protein and usually fortified with zinc and B vitamins. It has a savory taste that some people compare to cheese ( 20 ).

13. Homemade Granola
There are many types of granola, but most contain oats,  nuts  or seeds, dried fruits, spices and a sweetener.
Many store-bought granolas are laden with added sugar and vegetable oil. On the other hand, homemade varieties can be a healthy vegan snack rich in fiber, protein and healthy fats ( 21 ).
To make your own granola, combine old-fashioned oats, almonds,  pumpkin seeds , raisins and cinnamon with melted coconut oil and maple syrup. Spread out the mixture on a lined baking sheet and bake for 30–40 minutes at low heat in your oven.

14. Fruit and Nut Bars
Fruit and nut bars are an easy on-the-go snack that can be very nutritious.
Brands that have vegan bar options include LaraBars, GoMacro Bars and KIND Bars. A Cashew Cookie LaraBar (48 grams) has five grams of protein, 6% of the DV for potassium and 8% of the DV for iron ( 22 ).
You can also make your own fruit and nut bars by combining 1–2 cups (125–250 grams) of nuts, one cup (175 grams) of  dried fruit  and 1/4 cup (85 grams) of maple or brown rice syrup.
Spread this mixture in a greased 8-inch (20-cm) baking pan and bake for approximately 20 minutes at 325°F (165°C).

15. White Bean Dip and Homemade Pita Chips
White bean dip is typically made by blending white or cannellini beans with olive oil, lemon juice,  garlic  and fresh herbs.
White beans have an impressive nutrient profile, packing approximately five grams of protein, over 10% of the DV for iron and four grams of fiber in just 1/4 cup (50 grams) ( 23 ).
Pairing pita chips with white bean dip makes for a healthy vegan snack. You can make homemade pita chips by slicing whole grain pitas, brushing them with olive oil and baking them for 10 minutes at 400°F (205°C).

16. Peanut Butter and Banana Bites
Peanut butter and  banana  is a popular and healthy snack combination.
Bananas are loaded with potassium and fiber, while peanut butter provides protein and healthy fats. Eating them together can keep you feeling full and satisfied ( 1 ,  24 ).
To make peanut butter and banana bites, slice a banana into thin pieces and spread a layer of peanut butter in between two slices. These treats taste especially delicious when frozen for at least 30 minutes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper in your freezer.

17. Dried Coconut and Dark Chocolate
For a healthy vegan snack that will also satisfy your sweet tooth, try eating dried coconut with a few squares of  dark chocolate .
Dried coconut is made from dehydrated coconut flakes or pieces. Unsweetened varieties are incredibly nutritious, packing 18% of the DV for fiber in just one ounce (28 grams) ( 25 ).
As an added bonus, dark chocolate that is at least 65% cacao provides plant compounds and may have a number of health benefits. To make sure your dark chocolate is vegan, look for brands that do not contain any animal products ( 26 ).

18. Baked Veggie Chips
Baked veggie chips made from sliced vegetables, dehydrated or baked at low temperatures, are a delicious vegan snack.
Depending on the type of vegetable, baked veggie chips provide a variety of nutrients. For example, dehydrated carrots are loaded with vitamin A while baked  beet  chips are rich in potassium and folate ( 27 ,  28 ).
You can make your own vegetable chips by baking thinly sliced veggies at 200–250°F (90–120°C) for 30–60 minutes.

19. Spiced Nuts
Popular types of nuts include  almonds , pistachios, cashews,  walnuts , macadamia nuts and pecans.
All nuts are an incredibly nutritious vegan snack option. For example, just one ounce (23 grams) of almonds has six grams of protein, over 12% of the DV for fiber and several vitamins and minerals ( 29 ).
Nuts are especially delicious when coated in spices. You can buy spiced nuts at most grocery stores. To make homemade spiced nuts, toss your preferred variety in olive oil and seasonings before baking the mix for 15–20 minutes at 350°F (175°C).

20. Seaweed Crisps
Seaweed  crisps are made from sheets of seaweed that have been baked, sliced into squares and seasoned with salt.
They’re a vegan, low-calorie snack loaded with folate (vitamin B9), fiber and vitamins A and C. Seaweed is also an excellent source of iodine, a nutrient that naturally occurs in seawater and is vital to proper thyroid functioning ( 30 ,  31 ,  32 ).
When purchasing seaweed crisps, look for varieties with minimal ingredients, such as SeaSnax, which only contains seaweed, olive oil and salt.

21. No-Bake Energy Balls
Energy balls refer to bite-size snacks that are typically made from a mix of oats, nuts, seeds, nut butter, dried fruit, maple syrup and occasionally chocolate chips or other add-ins.
Depending on their ingredients, they can be a very nutritious vegan snack with protein, fiber and healthy fats that promote energy and satiety ( 14 ,  24 ).
To make homemade energy balls, you can combine one cup (90 grams) of old-fashioned oats, 1/2 cup (125 grams) of peanut butter, 1/3 cup (113 grams) maple syrup, two tablespoons of  hemp seeds  and two tablespoons of raisins.
Divide and roll the batter into balls and store in your refrigerator.

22. Ants on a Log
Ants on a log is the name of a popular snack made from celery sticks stuffed with peanut butter and  raisins .
This vegan treat is rich in fiber from celery, healthy fats from peanut butter and vitamins and minerals from the raisins ( 33 ).
To make ants on a log, simply slice a few stalks of celery into pieces, add peanut butter and sprinkle with raisins.

23. Almond-Butter-Stuffed Dried Dates
Dates  are chewy, brown fruits that grow on palm trees and have a sweet and nutty flavor.
They contain natural sugars and fiber that can give you a quick boost of energy. In fact, one date has approximately 18 grams of carbs ( 34 ).
For a healthy vegan snack, you can remove the pits of dates and stuff them with almond butter. However, keep in mind that they are high in calories, so remember to watch your portion size.

24. Frozen Grapes
Grapes  are small spherical fruits that grow on vines and come in purple, red, green and black.
One cup (151 grams) of grapes has 28% of the DV for vitamin K and 27% of the DV for vitamin C. They are also rich in polyphenols, which are plant compounds that may protect against heart disease and type 2 diabetes ( 35 ,  36 ).
Frozen grapes are a delicious vegan snack. For a refreshing treat, keep grapes in a container in your freezer and enjoy a handful when hunger strikes.

The Bottom Line

The vegan snacks above are a great way to combat hunger between meals.
They’re easy to make and a nutritious option for vegans and those just looking to eat more plant foods.
