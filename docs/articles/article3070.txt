Product comparison
Here’s a quick look at how the products compare:

How we chose
When looking for the best protein powders for building muscle, we considered the following criteria:
Formulation:  To support muscle gains, we chose products that contain  at least 20 g  of protein per serving and have evidence-backed ingredients such as whey protein and BCAAs.
Quality :  We looked for powders that are made with high quality ingredients and contain minimal additives and fillers.
Taste:  From dessert-inspired flavors to unflavored varieties, we included powders to suit a range of preferences. We also looked for products that have mostly positive reviews for taste and texture.
Price:  We considered whether the quality of the product aligns with the cost.
Manufacturing standards:  The companies included adhere to current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs) as determined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Third-party testing:  All the protein powders on our list are third-party tested.
Vetting:  All the products included have been vetted to ensure that they meet Healthline’s medical and business standards. You can read more about  our vetting process .

How to choose the best protein powder for muscle gain
With so many protein powders on the market, it can be difficult to determine which is best for building muscle.
Here are a few factors to consider:
When will you consume it?  Whey is best on either end of a workout, whereas casein is preferable when you want a sustained release, such as before bedtime.
Does the company use third-party testing?  Third-party testing ensures that the product is free of banned substances and harmful contaminants.
Is the product manufactured in a CGMP certified facility?  This label ensures adherence to high manufacturing standards set by the FDA.
Do you have any dietary restrictions?  Some protein powders contain potential allergens or substances you may be sensitive to, so it’s best to  read the label  carefully before purchasing.
Are all ingredients openly listed?  Some companies use proprietary blends to hide specific ingredients and amounts used. Because of this lack of transparency, it’s best to avoid these products.
Is it properly dosed?  A good general rule is to look for a protein powder with  at least 20 g  of protein per serving to promote muscle gains in combination with  resistance exercise .

Types of protein powders
There are several different types of protein powder available, each of which contains protein derived from various sources.
Some of the most common types of protein powder include:
Whey protein:  Whey is a type of protein found in milk. It’s a common ingredient in protein powders. Whey is digested and absorbed very quickly and can help  kickstart  muscle repair after your workout. However, it can also contribute to digestive issues and acne for some people, especially when consumed in high amounts.
Casein protein:  Casein is another milk protein, which is digested  more slowly  than whey. For this reason, it’s often taken before bed to provide the body with a steady stream of amino acids overnight. Like whey, casein is not suitable for those with a dairy allergy and can cause a similar set of negative side effects.
Plant-based proteins:  Many vegan protein powders contain a blend of proteins derived from ingredients like peas, brown rice, and lentils. Though plant-based proteins are often lacking in one or more of the essential amino acids your body needs, research  suggests  that plant proteins can still help stimulate muscle growth.
Egg white protein:  Egg white protein is high in  branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)  to  support  muscle growth and can be an appealing option for people who are unable to tolerate dairy-based protein powders like casein or whey. However, compared with other types of protein, it’s not as widely available and may be more expensive.
Bone broth protein:  Bone broth is naturally rich in collagen, which  can increase  strength and improve body composition when coupled with resistance training. On the other hand, because it’s typically made from beef or chicken bones, it’s not suitable for vegans or vegetarians.

How does protein powder work?
Protein powder is used to increase your intake of protein, a nutrient that’s broken down into smaller molecules known as amino acids.
Amino acids are the building blocks of the muscles and are required to support the growth and repair of tissues.
Consuming plenty of protein before or after resistance training  can ensure  that your body has the amino acids it needs to repair muscle damage caused by exercise.
It can also promote muscle protein synthesis, a metabolic process that helps your body build muscle mass.

How to safely increase protein intake
If you’re increasing your protein intake, it’s also important to adjust the ratio of other nutrients in your diet to ensure you’re meeting bodily needs.
For example, it’s best to balance high protein foods or supplements with other nutritious ingredients at each meal, including:
fruits
veggies
whole grains
healthy fats
Rather than depending solely on supplements, you might also want to consume protein from a variety of sources, such as:
meat
fish
poultry
eggs
dairy
soy products
legumes
Be sure to  drink plenty of water  and  consume enough fiber , which can help round out your diet and prevent some of the negative side effects associated with high protein intake.
Additionally, while you don’t necessarily need to increase your  carb consumption  while taking protein powder, low carb intake can worsen some side effects of a high protein diet.
While protein is an essential part of a balanced diet, consuming  too much protein  from supplements can cause adverse effects on health.
Some possible signs of excess protein intake  include :
weight gain
kidney problems
intestinal discomfort
headaches
nausea
diarrhea
dehydration
irritation
fatigue
If you experience any of the symptoms above after adding protein powder to your routine, it might be best to reduce your intake.

Research  does support  the use of protein powder, specifically after working out, for building muscle.
Some research  suggests  that an overall increase in calories and protein is important for muscle gain as well. Therefore, protein powders consumed at any time — not just post-workout — can still be beneficial.

As a beginner, you can try any protein powder you’d like, but it’s a good idea to take time to read the label first to check for any allergens or unwanted ingredients. Choosing a third-party tested product is always recommended, regardless of your fitness level.
An easy way to get started is to consume a protein shake immediately after your workout to help stimulate muscle building and recovery.
Because protein powders have been studied mostly in adults, teen athletes looking to increase muscle mass can also talk with a doctor or dietitian to  determine  whether protein powder is suitable for them.

For some people, certain ingredients commonly found in protein powders  can contribute  to acne, including dairy.
If you find that dairy causes acne or breakouts for you, switching to a dairy-free protein powder — such as the Garden of Life SPORT Organic Plant-Based Protein — may be beneficial.
A few of the most popular alternatives available also include protein powders sourced from:
egg whites
bone broth
plant-based sources like peas or brown rice
Some research also  suggests  that consuming a high amount of carbohydrates or foods with a  high glycemic index  — a measure of how much certain foods increase blood sugar levels — can also contribute to acne.
Therefore, selecting protein powders that are low in carbs or added sugar might also be a good choice to help keep skin clear.
If you’re able to tolerate dairy, the whey protein powders from Momentous and Naked are all free of added sugar and contain less than 5 g of carbs per serving.

For instance, Garden of Life’s plant-based protein is derived from a blend of protein sources, including peas, beans, and lentils, making it a great choice if you’re sensitive to dairy.
The egg white and chicken bone broth protein powders from NOW are also dairy-free and rich in essential amino acids to help boost muscle gain.

Protein powder can be added to smoothies and paired with other nutritious ingredients (such as fruits, veggies, and healthy fats) for a simple snack or occasional meal replacement.
However, protein powder shouldn’t be used as a substitute for a well-rounded meal plan. Be sure to enjoy protein powder in moderation alongside a variety of other nutrient-dense foods as part of a balanced diet.

Protein powder is most effective when paired with resistance training. Consuming protein before or after exercise  can stimulate  muscle protein synthesis, a metabolic process that promotes muscle growth.
