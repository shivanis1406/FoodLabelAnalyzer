Title: 14 Foods to Avoid (or Limit) on a Low-Carb Diet

A low carb diet typically has you limit bread, sweets, and starchy vegetables. Certain types of fruit may also be high in carbs.
Carbs are an important source of energy and one of the three main macronutrients in our diets, along with fat and protein.
Not only do carbohydrates fuel your brain and cells throughout your body, but they also regulate digestive health, appetite, cholesterol levels, and more.
Still, many people choose to limit their carb intake. Researchers have  linked  some low carb diets to benefits like increased weight loss and improved blood sugar control.
On a low carb diet, you may need to limit certain foods high in carbs and sugar. You make up for the reduction by increasing  proteins  and  healthy fats .
Your total daily carb target determines whether you need to limit some of these foods or avoid them altogether. Low carb diets typically contain  20–130 grams  of carbs per day, depending on your goals, needs, and preferences.
Keep reading to learn which foods to limit and avoid on a low carb diet.
When counting carbs on a low carb eating plan, nutritionists typically recommend  counting net carbs  rather than total carbs. To find the net carbs, you can subtract the fiber from the total carbohydrates listed under a food’s nutritional information, since fiber is not digested.
Here are 14 foods to limit on a low carb diet.

1. Some bread and grains
Bread  is a staple food in many cultures but is typically high in carbs.
Although exact counts vary by ingredients and portion size, bread  made from whole grains  typically has a lower amount of carbs when compared to those made from refined flour. It also contains more beneficial nutrients, including fiber. Whole grain products  include  the endosperm, germ, and bran of the grain.
The amount of carbs in whole grain products can vary by product and portion size.
To reduce the number of carbs you’re eating, you can manage the amount of bread and grains you eat. You can try making some whole grain swaps, like:
whole wheat bread  instead of white bread:  1 larger slice (32 grams) of whole wheat bread:  13 grams  of carbs (11 grams net carbs) 1 smaller slice (23 grams) of white bread:   13 grams  of carbs (12.7 grams net carbs)
1 larger slice (32 grams) of whole wheat bread:  13 grams  of carbs (11 grams net carbs)
1 smaller slice (23 grams) of white bread:   13 grams  of carbs (12.7 grams net carbs)
brown  or  purple rice  instead of white rice  brown rice, uncooked (100 grams or about 1/2 cup uncooked, 1-1/2 cups cooked):  77 grams  of carbs (74 grams net carbs) purple rice, uncooked (100 grams):   76 grams  of carbs (72 grams net carbs) white rice, uncooked (100 grams):  83 grams  of carbs (83 grams net carbs)
brown rice, uncooked (100 grams or about 1/2 cup uncooked, 1-1/2 cups cooked):  77 grams  of carbs (74 grams net carbs)
purple rice, uncooked (100 grams):   76 grams  of carbs (72 grams net carbs)
white rice, uncooked (100 grams):  83 grams  of carbs (83 grams net carbs)
whole wheat  tortillas, flatbread, or pita instead of varieties made from refined flour  whole wheat tortillas (1 tortilla, 49 grams):   19 grams  of carbs (15 grams net carbs) flour tortillas (1 tortilla, 49 grams):  24 grams  of carbs (23 grams net carbs)
whole wheat tortillas (1 tortilla, 49 grams):   19 grams  of carbs (15 grams net carbs)
flour tortillas (1 tortilla, 49 grams):  24 grams  of carbs (23 grams net carbs)
You can also  make your own low carb bread with these recipes .
You can also include  other whole grains  in your eating plan, such as:
quinoa
freekeh
bulgur
barley
oats
millet
On a low carb diet, you may want to limit your intake of some bread and grains. Try whole-grain varieties instead, as they contain more fiber and fewer net carbs.

2. Some fruit
Eating lots of whole fruits and veggies has consistently been linked to a lower risk of  cancer  and  heart disease . They provide beneficial vitamins and antioxidants.
While fruits can be high in carbs, many are high in fiber as well. This reduces the number of net carbs.
Some low carb swaps may include:
whole  peaches, plums, and nectarines  instead of varieties canned in syrup  1 whole peach (147 grams):   15 grams  of carbs (13 grams net carbs) 1 cup canned peaches in heavy syrup (262 grams):   52 grams  of carbs (49 grams net carbs)
1 whole peach (147 grams):   15 grams  of carbs (13 grams net carbs)
1 cup canned peaches in heavy syrup (262 grams):   52 grams  of carbs (49 grams net carbs)
a half-cup of fresh berries or cut  apples  instead of  dried and sweetened  cranberries  1 cup raspberries (123 grams):   15 grams  of carbs (7 grams net carbs) 1 cup sliced golden delicious apple (109 grams):  15 grams  of carbs (12 grams net carbs) 1/4 cup sweetened cranberries (40 grams):   33 grams  of carbs (31 grams net carbs)
1 cup raspberries (123 grams):   15 grams  of carbs (7 grams net carbs)
1 cup sliced golden delicious apple (109 grams):  15 grams  of carbs (12 grams net carbs)
1/4 cup sweetened cranberries (40 grams):   33 grams  of carbs (31 grams net carbs)
Berries  are lower in sugar and higher in fiber than other fruits. This makes berries suitable for low carb diets. Other low carb fruits can include:
watermelon
strawberries
cantaloupe
You can also try adding fruits that are high in healthy fats to your diet. This may include:
avocado
shredded  coconut
plantains
You may want to limit some fruits, including sweetened, dried fruits, and fruits canned in syrup, on a low carb diet. Berries and  other whole fruits  typically contain fiber and other beneficial nutrients and can be enjoyed on a low carb diet.

3. Starchy vegetables
Most diets allow an unlimited intake of vegetables.
Plus, many veggies are very high in fiber,  which may  aid weight loss and support blood sugar control, in addition to contributing to a lower number of net carbs.
Starchy vegetables  contain more digestible carbs than fiber. On a low carb diet, you may want to enjoy them in moderation. Here are the carb counts for 100 grams of some cooked starchy vegetables:
Sweet corn:   75 grams  (59 grams net)
Potatoes:   22 grams  ( 20 grams net)
Sweet potatoes:   18 grams  (15 grams net)
Peas:  25 grams  (16 grams net)
Butternut squash:  11 grams (8 grams net)
Notably, you can enjoy many  low carb vegetables  on a low carb diet. Here are the carb counts for 100 grams of some low carb vegetables:
Bell peppers:   5 grams  (4 grams net)
Asparagus:   4 grams  (2 grams net)
Mushrooms:   5 grams  (3 grams net)
Baby spinach:  2 grams  (1 gram net)
Although many vegetables are low in carbs, a few are quite high. It’s best to choose mostly non-starchy, high fiber vegetables when limiting your carb intake.

4. Pasta
Though  pasta  is versatile and inexpensive, it’s also high in carbs. Choosing a whole wheat variety is typically lower in carbs.
Just 1 cup (151 grams) of cooked spaghetti packs  46 grams  of carbs (43 grams net carbs). The same amount of whole wheat pasta provides  45 grams  (39 grams net carbs).
You can also look for pasta that isn’t made of wheat. Many versions contain high amounts of fiber and result in a reduced amount of net carbs. These numbers can vary by product.  Low carb pasta alternatives  can include:
spiralized vegetables , such as zucchini
spaghetti squash
chickpea pasta
veggie pasta
lentil pasta
shirataki noodles
You can also substitute rice for pasta in some instances. Opt for  brown  or  purple rice  instead of white rice, as they have more fiber and are less processed. Here are the carb counts for 100 grams of rice (or around 1/2 cup uncooked, which makes between 1-1 1/2 cups cooked):
brown rice:  77 grams  of carbs (74 grams net carbs)
purple rice:   76 grams  of carbs (72 grams net carbs)
white rice:  83 grams  of carbs (83 grams net carbs)
You can reduce your carb counts when eating pasta by opting for whole wheat noodles, spiralized vegetables, and other low carb pasta alternatives.

5. Cereal
It’s well known that  sugary breakfast cereals  contain a lot of carbs. They also contain a lot of added sugar.
But if you choose options that are also high in fiber and control your portion size, some cereals can be included as part of a low carb diet.
Cooked instant oats (1 cup cooked):   27 grams  of carbs (23 grams net carbs)
Steel-cut oats (1/4 cup dry):   28 grams  of carbs (23 grams net carbs)
Granola (1/2 cup) :  41 grams  of carbs (36 grams net carbs)
You can also make your own  granola  or  muesli  and more directly control the amount of carbs and added sugar you’re eating. Some potential low carb ingredients include:
oats
quinoa flakes
nuts
chia seeds
hemp seed
You’ll want to avoid sugary breakfast cereals on a low carb diet. But high fiber breakfast options such as oatmeal and homemade granola may fit within your carb allowance.

6. Beer and mixers
You can enjoy  alcohol  in moderation on a low carb diet. In fact,  dry wine  has very few carbs, and hard liquors like  rum  have none.
But beer is fairly high in carbs. On average, a 12-ounce (360-mL) can of beer packs  13 grams  of carbs, while a light beer contains  6 grams .
Research  also suggests that liquids aren’t as filling as solid foods — so you may consume more calories from them more easily.  Beer  is also lacking in important nutrients found in other high carb foods, such as protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals.
If you’re drinking hard liquors, mixers can be a source of sugar and carbs. This can make the carbs add up quickly.
Dry wine and spirits are better alcohol options on a low carb diet than beer and sweet wine.

7. Sweetened yogurt
Many people tend to eat fruit-flavored, sweetened yogurt varieties, which often contain as many carbs as desserts.
One cup (245 grams) of nonfat sweetened fruit yogurt contains about  47 grams  of carbs. This is higher than a comparable serving of  ice cream .
Instead, it’s best to opt for unsweetened, plain  yogurt  when possible and add your favorite low carb toppings. For instance, 1/2 cup (123 grams) of  plain Greek yogurt  topped with 1/2 cup (50 grams) of  raspberries  keeps the net carbs under 10 grams.
Sweetened low fat or nonfat yogurt often contains as many carbs as ice cream and other desserts. Plain yogurt paired with low carb toppings, such as berries, may be a better choice if you’re on a low carb diet.

8. Juice
Although it contains some valuable vitamins and minerals,  juice  is high in carbs and low in fiber, which can make it challenging to fit into a low carb diet. Many varieties also contain added sugar.
Apple juice (12 ounces, 355 mL):  42 grams  of carbs
Grape juice (12 ounces, 355 mL):   55 grams  of carbs
Vegetable juice (12 ounces, 355 mL):   23 grams  of carbs (19 net carbs)
You may want to watch your juice intake on a low carb diet. Instead of juice and other sugary drinks, you may be able to make your own  low carb smoothies  or opt for water or tea.
Juice is high in carbs and low in fiber, which may make it difficult to include on a low carb diet. You can swap juice for  low carb beverages .

9. Low fat and fat-free salad dressings
You can eat a wide variety of salads on a low carb diet.
But commercial dressings — especially low fat and fat-free varieties — can add more carbs than you might expect.
For example, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of fat-free French dressing contain 10 grams of carbs while an equal portion of fat-free ranch dressing has 7 grams ( 40 ,  41 ). Many people commonly use more than that on a large entrée salad.
To minimize carbs, dress your salad with a creamy,  full-fat dressing . Or, make your own homemade vinaigrette using a splash of vinegar and extra virgin  olive oil , which is  linked to  improved heart health and may support moderate body weight.
Limit your intake of fat-free and low fat salad dressings, which are typically high in carbs, and opt for creamy dressings or make a homemade vinaigrette instead.

10. Beans and legumes
Beans  and legumes provide many health benefits, including  reduced inflammation  and  heart disease risk .
While they’re high in carbs, they also contain a  fair amount of fiber .
Here are the carb counts for 1 cup (160–200 grams) of cooked beans and legumes:
Lentils:   39 grams  (23 grams net)
Peas:   25 grams  (16 grams net)
Black beans:   41 grams  (26 grams net)
Pinto beans:   45 grams  (30 grams net)
Chickpeas:   45 grams  (32 grams net)
Kidney beans:   40 grams  (27 grams net)
Beans and legumes are healthy, high fiber foods. You can eat them on a low carb diet depending on your daily carb limit.

11. Honey or sugar in any form
You’re probably well aware that foods high in  refined white sugar , such as cookies, candy, and cake, should be limited on a low carb diet.
Natural forms of sugar can have as many carbs, if not more.They also typically have very little to no fiber.
Here are the carb counts per 1 tablespoon (13–21 grams) of several types of sugar:
White sugar:   13 grams
Maple syrup:   13 grams
Agave nectar:   16 grams
Honey:   17 grams
Many sweeteners provide little to no nutritional value. When limiting your carb intake, it’s important to choose nutritious, high fiber carb sources.
To sweeten foods or beverages without adding carbs, choose a  low carb sweetener  instead, such as  stevia  or  monk fruit .
If you’re on a low carb diet, you should limit your intake of sugar, honey, maple syrup, and  other forms of sugar , which are high in carbs but low in important nutrients.

12. Chips and crackers
Just 1 ounce (28 grams) of tortilla chips — or 10–15 average-sized chips — contains  19 grams  of carbs (18 grams of net carbs). Crackers vary in carb content depending on processing, but even whole wheat crackers pack about 20 grams of carbs (17 grams net carbs) per ounce (28 grams) ( 57 ,  58 ).
Most people eat  processed snack foods  in large quantities, so you should limit them if you’re on a low carb diet.
You can try making veggie chips at home or shopping for less processed alternatives, which are usually made from ingredients like:
almond flour
wheat bran
flaxseed
You can also swap ultra-processed snack foods for hard-boiled eggs, cottage cheese, or nuts.
Most commercial chips, crackers, and other processed, grain-based snack foods are high in carbs. Try making veggie chips or look for less processed snacks that are low in carbs.

13. Milk and alternatives
Milk  is an excellent source of several nutrients, including calcium, potassium, and several B vitamins.
However, it’s also fairly high in carbs. If you’re only using 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL) in coffee each day, you may be able to include small amounts of milk in your low carb diet. Or, you could opt for creamer.
Whole,  low fat , and  skim  milk (8 ounces, 240 mL):   2–13 grams  of carbs
Cream (1 ounce, 30 mL):   1 gram  of carbs
Half-and-half (1 ounce, 30 mL):   1 gram  of carbs
Unsweetened almond milk   (8 ounces, 240 mL):   3 grams  of carbs
Sweetened vanilla almond milk (8 ounces, 240 mL):   16 grams  of carbs (15 grams net carbs)
Unsweetened coconut milk (8 ounces, 240 mL):   6 grams  of carbs
Sweetened plant-based milk can contain more carbs than dairy milk.
If you enjoy drinking milk by the glass or use it to make lattes or smoothies, consider unsweetened almond or  coconut milk  instead.
You can typically add a small amount of milk to coffee once per day on many low carb diets. A  milk alternative  like unsweetened almond or coconut milk may be better if you drink large amounts.

14. Gluten-free baked goods
Gluten is a group of proteins  found in wheat, barley, and rye.
Some people with  celiac disease  or other gluten-related disorders must avoid gluten to manage digestive symptoms and prevent intestinal damage.
Gluten-free bread, muffins, and other baked goods aren’t typically low in carbs. In fact, they often boast even more carbs than their gluten-containing counterparts.
What’s more, the flour used to make these foods is typically made from starches and grains that tend to raise blood sugar rapidly ( 66 ).
If you’re limiting your carb intake, stick to whole foods or use almond or coconut flour to make your own low carb baked goods rather than eating processed gluten-free foods.
Gluten-free breads and muffins can be as high in carbs as traditional baked goods. They’re also often made with carb sources that raise blood sugar quickly.

Why you may want to reduce carbs
Although a low carb diet isn’t right for everyone, people may choose to reduce their carb intake for many reasons.
For example, research shows that low carb diets may support weight loss  as effectively  as other popular eating patterns, such as low fat diets. All the same, low carb diets may have limited efficacy over the long term ( 67 ,  68 ).
Low carb or carb-controlled diets are also often recommended to treat diabetes. In fact, one review of nine studies reported that a low carb diet helped improve long-term blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes ( 69 ,  70 ).
Very low carb diets like the  ketogenic diet  have also been shown to increase weight loss and improve insulin sensitivity, which may help enhance blood sugar control ( 71 ).
What’s more, one study found that low carb diets may help reduce the effects of  metabolic syndrome  — a group of risk factors that may increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes — in people with obesity ( 72 ).
Low carb diets may help increase weight loss, improve blood sugar control, and help prevent metabolic syndrome.

Is a low carb diet healthy?
Low carb diets can be healthy and can have health benefits, especially for weight management and blood sugar control. A well-planned low carb diet can include a variety of  nutrient-dense ingredients , including:
high fiber fruits
vegetables
nuts
seeds
Some types of low carb diets, like keto and Atkins, may be overly restrictive and unsustainable in the long run.
While the keto diet may aid short-term weight loss, it also limits many nutritious food groups and may  increase your risk  of  several conditions  if followed long-term, including:
constipation
kidney stones
fatty liver disease
vitamin or mineral deficiencies
Very low carb diets  may not be suitable  for everyone, including:
children
pregnant people
people with certain chronic health conditions
Also, the quality of the low carb food matters.
Eating more plant-based fats and proteins while lowering your intake of refined carbs and sugar can reduce your diabetes risk. But low carb diets emphasizing animal protein and minimizing whole grains  can increase  diabetes risk.
That’s why it’s best to talk with a doctor or dietitian before lowering your carb intake drastically.
Low carb diets may have health benefits. But very low carb diets can be overly restrictive and contribute to adverse effects if followed long-term.
