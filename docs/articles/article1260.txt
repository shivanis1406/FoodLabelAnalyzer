Title: 6 Emerging Benefits and Uses of Carom Seeds (Ajwain)

Carom seeds (ajwain) contain fiber, antioxidants, and other beneficial nutrients. It may provide some health benefits, including improving cholesterol levels and indigestion.
Carom seeds are the seeds of the ajwain herb, or  Trachyspermum ammi . They’re common in Indian cuisine.
Although referred to as “seeds,” carom seeds are the fruit of the ajwain herb.
They’re slightly green to brown in color and have a pungent, bitter taste. They look similar to cumin seeds, but their taste and aroma are closer to that of thyme.
They’re often sold as whole seeds but can also be ground into a powder and used as a cooking spice.
Carom seeds are incredibly nutritious, being rich in fiber, antioxidants, and other vitamins and minerals. Because of this, they have been associated with health benefits and long been used in traditional Indian medicine practices.
Here are the top 6 health benefits and uses of carom seeds.

1. Fight bacteria and fungi
Carom seeds have powerful antibacterial and antifungal properties.
This is likely attributed to two of its active compounds, thymol and carvacrol, which have been shown to inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
Test-tube studies indicate that these compounds may combat potentially harmful bacteria like  Escherichia coli  ( E. coli ) and  Salmonella  — culprits of  food poisoning  and other health conditions ( 2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
One test-tube study observed that carom seeds were more effective against multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria and fungi including  Candida albicans, Candida krusei,  and  Streptococcus mutans  compared to other solvents ( 5 ).
However, further research is needed to examine how the seeds may affect the growth of bacteria and fungi in humans.
Test-tube studies show that carom seeds and its compounds may inhibit the growth of certain strains of bacteria and fungi, including  E. coli ,  Salmonella , and  Candida albicans .

2. Improve cholesterol levels
Animal research indicates that carom seeds may  lower cholesterol  and triglyceride levels. High cholesterol and triglyceride levels are risk factors for heart disease.
In one rabbit study, carom seed powder reduced total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels ( 6 ).
Similarly, a study in rats found that carom seed extract was effective in lowering total cholesterol,  triglyceride , and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels while also increasing levels of heart-protective HDL (good) cholesterol ( 7 ).
Still, in both studies, carom seed powder only proved effective at treating high cholesterol levels when used in high doses that you won’t get from eating the seeds through a normal diet.
More studies are needed to evaluate how the seeds may affect cholesterol levels in humans.
Animal studies show that carom seed powder and extract in high doses may reduce elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels — both of which are risk factors for heart disease.

3. May lower blood pressure
High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a common condition that increases your risk of  heart disease  and stroke ( 8 ,  9 ).
Traditional treatment involves the use of medications like calcium-channel blockers. These blockers prevent calcium from entering the cells of your heart and relax and expand blood vessels, resulting in lower blood pressure ( 10 ).
Some research indicates that thymol — a major component of carom seeds — may have calcium-channel-blocking effects and could help lower blood pressure levels.
For instance, studies demonstrate that carom seed extract reduces blood pressure levels in rats ( 11 ,  12 ).
However, research on carom seed’s effectiveness in lowering blood pressure levels is still limited. Further studies are needed to understand how the seeds may affect blood pressure in humans.
Carom seeds may act as a calcium-channel blocker and help lower blood pressure levels, though current research is limited to animal studies.

4. Combats peptic ulcers and relieves indigestion
Carom seeds are commonly used as a household remedy for digestive issues in Ayurvedic medicine ( 13 ).
Some studies show that carom seed extract may  combat peptic ulcers , which are sores of the esophagus, stomach, or small intestine ( 1 ,  13 ).
For example, a two-week rat study observed that treatment with carom seed extract improved stomach ulcers caused by ibuprofen ( 14 ).
The study found that the effect of the extract was comparable to that of a common medication used to treat peptic ulcers ( 14 ).
Carom seed extract may also help prevent and treat gas and chronic indigestion. Indigestion is categorized as persistent pain and discomfort in the upper part of your stomach. Delayed stomach emptying is one of the perceived causes of indigestion ( 15 ).
Interestingly, carom seed spice has shown to accelerate the process of food passing through the stomach in rats, which may help improve indigestion. Still, this has not been proven in human studies ( 16 ).
There is some evidence that carom seeds may help fight peptic ulcers and improve indigestion, but research is limited to animal studies.

5. May prevent coughing and improve airflow
Some evidence suggests that carom seeds may provide relief from  coughing .
Though research is scant, one study in guinea pigs found that carom seeds produced an anticoughing effect greater than that of codeine, a common medication used to treat coughs ( 17 ).
Carom seeds may also improve airflow to the lungs.
In a study in people with asthma, treatment with 0.057–0.113 ml per pound (0.125–0.25 ml per kg) of body weight of carom seed extract increased airflow to the lungs 30–180 minutes after administration ( 18 ).
The effect was comparable to that of  theophylline , a common asthma medication ( 18 ).
Ultimately, more research is needed to better understand the effect of carom seeds on coughing and other respiratory symptoms in humans.
There is limited research suggesting that carom seeds may have anticoughing effects and could help increase airflow to the lungs.

6. Has anti-inflammatory effects
Inflammation can be good or bad. Short-term inflammation is your body’s natural way of protecting against illness or injury.
On the other hand, chronic inflammation can have negative effects on your body and increase your risk of certain diseases ( 19 ).
Carom seeds have been shown to have  anti-inflammatory effects  and may reduce inflammation in your body.
A rat study found that supplementing with carom seed extract had significant anti-inflammatory effects ( 20 ).
Similarly, a recent study found that arthritis-induced rats given carom seed extract for 21 days had improved inflammatory markers, such as lowered elastase levels, which is an enzyme associated with inflammation ( 21 ).
While more research is needed, scientists concluded that carom seed extract may have potential as a treatment for inflammatory disease ( 21 ).
Some evidence suggests that carom seed extract may have anti-inflammatory properties. However, research is limited to animal studies.

Are carom seeds safe?
For most people, carom seeds are safe to consume.
Still, pregnant or  breastfeeding  women should avoid them due to potentially dangerous effects on fetal health, including potential birth defects or even miscarriage ( 1 ).
If you’re pregnant, it’s important to consult with your healthcare provider before taking carom seeds in seed, extract, or powdered form.
Additionally, anecdotal reports of nausea after ingesting high doses of carom seeds have been noted. For this reason, the seeds should be eaten in small amounts.
Carom seeds are safe to consume for the majority of people. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid taking carom seeds, as they have been shown to have toxic effects on fetuses.

The bottom line
Carom seeds have long been used in traditional Indian cuisine and Ayurvedic medicine.
They have been shown to possess antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects and may be effective in treating peptic ulcers and reducing blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
Still, most evidence is from animal and test-tube studies, and further research is needed to better understand the benefits of carom seeds on human health.
Carom seeds are considered safe for most people. However, the seeds are unsafe for  pregnant women  as they have been associated with harmful effects on fetuses.
If you want to add carom seeds to your diet, you can find them in stores and  online .
