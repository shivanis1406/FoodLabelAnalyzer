A low sodium diet plan typically involves limiting processed foods and eating foods naturally low in sodium, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, meat, and dairy products.
While these recommendations may not sound very restrictive, preparing meals that meet them can be difficult.
Fortunately, plenty of meal delivery services support low sodium diets, including several that also provide options for other dietary restrictions. Here are the best we’ve found.

Sunbasket is a popular certified  organic meal delivery company . Unlike many other subscription services, Sunbasket offers both meal kits with fresh ingredients and recipe cards, and heat-and-eat refrigerated meals.
Healthline nutrition editor Kelli McGrane, MS, RD, tried Sunbasket and says: “Out of all of the meal kits I’ve tried, Sunbasket’s ingredients tasted the freshest, especially the seafood and meats. I found most of the dishes to be bursting with flavor and appreciated the wide variety of ingredients used, especially vegetables.”
Sunbasket doesn’t offer a low sodium meal plan, but its meals are much lower in sodium than those of other meal kit delivery services, earning it our pick as the best low sodium meal delivery on the market.
Most Sunbasket meals contain less than 800 milligrams (mg) of sodium per serving, and meals on the diabetes-friendly menu contain less than 700 mg per serving.
Sunbasket also offers a variety of low sodium add-on items, including fresh pasta, snacks, and desserts. You can add extra servings of protein as well.

BistroMD is a physician-created meal delivery plan that offers fully prepared, flash-frozen meals that are ready to heat and eat.
Healthline contributor Steven Rowe comments on the variety of meals available — customers can choose from more than 150 meals per week — saying: “You can really pick what you’re in the mood for, including everything from savory meals to sweet snacks.”
The company offers a full menu, which includes breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as well as a lunch and dinner-only menu. “Each meal had a good variety of flavors, veggies, and proteins,” Rowe says.
“The taste and texture of the meals were also very good, which was surprising considering they were shipped and reheated in the microwave. I was impressed with their bold flavors.”
Customers can choose from the following plan options:
5-day plan
7-day plan
custom plan
Meals on BistroMD’s Heart Healthy program contain less than 600 mg of sodium and are low in  saturated fat , making the program a good choice for those on 2-gram (g) or 3-g sodium-restricted diets.
According to the BistroMD website, the meals on the Heart Healthy program are designed to support lower blood pressure and generate  weight loss .
Still, Rowe adds, “The meal portions were well sized, so I never felt like I ate too much and could share with my wife.”
BistroMD meal plans also come with unlimited support from a team of registered dietitians for all customers. This may be helpful for people who have questions about their dietary needs.
With its doctor-designed, balanced meals, BistroMD can be a good DASH diet meal delivery option as well.
Additionally, BistroMD runs a meal delivery service called  Silver Cuisine , which also offers a low sodium menu of meals with less than 600 mg of sodium per serving.

Trifecta Nutrition is a meal delivery service offering high quality, calorie-controlled meals that are low in sodium.
In fact, most meals plans contain around 300 mg to 500 mg of sodium on average per meal, making this service an excellent choice for people on sodium-restricted diets. Meanwhile, items on the keto plan contain around 800 mg on average.
Despite the lower calories and low sodium, Healthline writer Rachael Ajmera, MS, RD, calls the meals “tasty, filling, and nutritious.”
Trifecta also offers an array of meal plans to suit different macronutrient needs, such as high protein and low carb. Following a calorie-controlled diet that’s high in protein is an  effective way  to lose excess body fat.
Trifecta uses organic produce whenever possible, based on supplier availability and sources of humanely raised animal products. It also uses 100% grass-fed red meat and sustainably caught seafood.
Most plans offer fully prepared meals that are ready to heat and eat, though Ajmera notes that “meals do require a bit more preparation than some other similar services as they recommend reheating using the stovetop or oven rather than the microwave.”
You can also opt for the Meal Prep and Classic meal plans, which come with preportioned ingredients for meals that you cook at home.

Meal type   prepared meals

Shipping   shipping calculated at checkout
Magic Kitchen is a meal delivery service that provides prepared frozen meals and caters to a variety of dietary needs and health conditions, including  diabetes  and  chronic kidney disease (CKD ).
For this reason, it’s one of our top choices as the best low sodium meal delivery for seniors and those with chronic health conditions.
Magic Kitchen’s Low Sodium menu includes meals that provide less than 700 mg of sodium per serving. Most have less than 500 mg sodium per serving, per the company’s website.
Betty Boler, a family member of a Healthline employee, tested Magic Kitchen for a few meals, and she liked the variety and the freshness of the ingredients.
“There was a good variety of meals to choose from with two vegetables included on most of the meals. The meals were low on carbohydrates.”
In addition to lunches and dinners, the service also offers a variety of low sodium breakfasts, soups, snacks, and desserts, all of which can be reheated in the oven or microwave.
Though the meals were easy to prepare, Boler said that “spices needed to be added for flavor, and some of the vegetables were too soft.” But overall, Boler would recommend these products because “the meal prep was easy and it was through home delivery.”
Customers can choose from the Complete Meals — which contain a main course with one or two side dishes — or the a la carte menus, which allow you to select items individually.

Best gluten-free and FODMAP
Meal type   prepared meals
Sodium per serving   500–850 mg on average
Shipping   calculated at checkout (free for orders over $125)

Epicured is a subscription meal delivery service focusing on  low FODMAP  and  gluten-free  prepared foods, which are delivered fully cooked, refrigerated, and ready to heat and eat.

The service offers various diet-specific options, and meals can be filtered to accommodate allergies and nutritional needs, including very low sodium items with less than 140 mg of sodium per serving.

Additionally, many meals contain fewer than 800 mg of sodium, and the full nutritional information for each item is available on the menu.
Epicured boasts a large menu with an assortment of options, including many low sodium salads, entrees, wraps, soups, and sides.
McGrane comments: “I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of cuisine, protein, and vegetable-types offered. I also like that there was a good variety of types of meals, including sandwiches, rice dishes, soups, salads, etc. I prefer to eat mostly vegetarian, with one to two meat dishes per week, and I found it very easy to find options that fit those preferences.
“Overall I was impressed with the meals: All of the ingredients were incredibly fresh and appeared to be good quality,” she says. “I particularly loved how the vegetables retained a good texture, even after being prepared ahead of time and reheated.”
As far as the sign-up process goes, McGrane calls it “a bit clunky.” She adds: “It wasn’t clear whether Epicured automatically sends you the same options each week if you forget to go back in and change your menu.
“But the meal selection process itself was very straightforward, and I appreciated having multiple delivery days to choose from.”

Fresh N Lean is a meal delivery service that delivers a wide range of fresh heat-and-eat foods weekly, with more than 100 dishes available across the service’s various meal plans, which include Keto, Paleo, and  Whole30 . There are also Vegetarian, Standard Vegan, and Low Carb Vegan options.
Most Fresh N Lean meals are low sodium and generally average around 600 mg per serving.
Still, while McGrane suggests that Fresh N Lean might work for people who follow a particular diet, including low sodium or paleo, and want the convenience of having prepared meals delivered to their door, she found the food itself underwhelming.
“The vegetables and tofu were very bland and underseasoned, while the chicken meatloaf was overly spiced and reminded me more of a sausage than meatloaf,” she says. “The Keto meal was my least favorite, as the cauliflower feta mixture had an unpleasant smell, the shrimp were a bit rubbery, and the sausage again was too heavily seasoned.”
While you cannot choose meals from a specific menu, you can select up to three ingredients to exclude from your weekly menu or opt to order a la carte instead.
The company uses local, organic, and sustainably sourced ingredients, and some meals are gluten- and GMO-free.

How to choose a low sodium meal delivery service
When searching for a low sodium meal delivery service, there are a few things to consider.
If you have a health condition that requires a specific  macro-  or  micronutrient intake , it’s best to work with a qualified healthcare professional who can offer dietary advice.
They may suggest that you follow a diet that contains a specific  amount of sodium . For example, someone with heart failure may be required to restrict their sodium intake to 2 g or less per day.
Depending on the severity of the condition,  people with kidney disease  may need to restrict sodium as well as:
potassium
phosphorus
protein
This can become quite complicated, so it can be helpful to get advice from a healthcare professional or registered dietitian. They can help you choose a meal delivery service that meets your specific needs.
Additionally, it’s important to consider whether you’d like to have meals that require no preparation or would rather use a meal kit delivery service that requires some light cooking.
Price is another factor to consider, as pricing varies considerably among meal delivery services.
Finally, always take a look at the menu before signing up for a meal delivery service to ensure that the company offers meals you find appealing.
