Title: The 21 Best Coffee Makers for Every Purpose

If coffee equals necessity in your life, this one’s for you. From drip machines to pour-overs, here’s our take on the best coffee makers.
Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world ( 1 ).
In addition to providing caffeine, it contains more than 1,000 bioactive compounds, some of which have been shown to have beneficial  antioxidant  and  anti-inflammatory  effects ( 1 ,  2 ).
Drinking coffee is a regular part of many people’s  morning routines . And while there’s no shame in a daily stop at your local coffee joint, if you’re someone who has taken to brewing your beans at home, you’ve likely found yourself trying to determine the best coffee maker.
Along with the quality of the beans, the type of coffee maker you use significantly affects the quality of your morning brew. Ask any coffee nerd — the argument can get heated. And that’s exactly what we did. After chatting with passionate coffee drinkers about their go-to coffee makers and why they love them, we weighed the pros and cons and compiled this list.
Whether you prefer to use an automatic drip machine or a manual pour-over method, here are the 21 best coffee makers for every purpose.

Best drip coffee makers
Automatic drip coffee makers brew coffee by dripping hot water over ground coffee beans. The coffee passes through a filter and into a carafe, which is typically situated on a hot plate to keep the coffee warm.
When shopping for a drip coffee maker, you may want to consider the following factors:
brew temperature, since the temperature of the water can greatly affect the coffee’s flavor
brew time
the volume of coffee the machine can make
how long it keeps the coffee hot
If you prefer to wake up to your coffee all ready to go, you’ll want to look for a machine with programmable options.

The Ninja 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker is our overall best pick for a drip coffee maker because it has the standard settings you’d expect from a coffee maker and gets rave reviews for the quality of its coffee.
To ensure the best flavor, this Ninja coffee maker maintains a constant temperature throughout brewing, evenly saturates the beans using its Ninja XL Showerhead, and blooms the  coffee beans  before brewing.
Blooming is a process of wetting the coffee beans to help release their carbon dioxide before adding the rest of the water. This step makes it easier for the water to extract the beans’ flavors, resulting in a more flavorful cup.
In addition to a 24-hour programmable delay for preparing your brew in advance, it has an option to brew coffee in small 1- to 4-cup (237- to 946-milliliter [mL]) batches for when you don’t plan on making a full 12-cup (2.8-liter [L]) pot.
Other features include a mid-brew pause to allow you to pour a cup before all the coffee has been brewed, a 4-hour warming plate, a cleaning cycle, a water tank that doesn’t need to be refilled each time, and a 1-year warranty.

Significantly more expensive than most other coffee makers on this list, the Technivorm Moccamaster is the best option for true coffee connoisseurs. One of our connoisseurs here at Healthline has deemed it “life changing.”
Handmade in the Netherlands, this coffee maker is elegantly designed. It’s also approved by the  Specialty Coffee Association (SCA)  and the European Coffee Brewing Centre for the quality of its coffee.
Especially if you spend extra for high quality beans, the Technivorm gets great reviews for bringing out their flavor by using a copper heating element to bring the water up to the proper temperature quickly and keeping the temperature consistent throughout brewing.
It uses a 9-hole showerhead to fully saturate the coffee beans and extract as much flavor as it can — and it does all this in just 6 minutes.
The Technivorm Moccamaster can make  up to 40 ounces (oz)  (1.2 L) of coffee at a time, is easy to use, and has an automatic shutoff for safety. Plus, it comes with a 5-year warranty.

If you’re looking for a no-frills, budget-friendly coffee maker, the Hamilton Beach Programmable Coffee Maker is your best option.
It has two features that are often missing from inexpensive coffee makers: a programmable clock to schedule your brew time and  brew strength  in advance and a 2-hour automatic shutoff for safety.
While it lacks some of the brewing features of more expensive models, it still produces a smooth cup of coffee. However, some reviewers complain that the coffee could be hotter.

Whether your household goes through a lot of coffee in the morning or you’re buying a coffee maker for a small office, this Salton coffee maker is a good option.
Making up to 14 cups (3.3 L) at a time, the Salton is inexpensive and gets great reviews for being easy to pour and producing a good cup of coffee.
While it is programmable, this machine doesn’t have a lot of additional features, so it’s a good option for those who are looking for a basic, good quality coffee maker.

One way to improve the flavor of your coffee is to grind the beans just before brewing rather than buy them pre-ground.
If you want the benefit of freshly ground beans without buying another appliance, the GEVI 10-Cup Programmable Drip Coffee Machine is one of the best grind-and-brew options.
The GEVI has a built-in coffee grinder, featuring eight settings to control the grind size of your beans. You can also choose from among three coffee strength settings.
To use the GEVI, you simply choose the number of cups of coffee you want to make and the desired strength. The machine will then grind and brew the appropriate ratio of beans to water.
You also have the option to brew pre-ground beans in this machine.

For a coffee maker with greater functionality, opt for the Ninja Hot and Cold Brewed System.
In addition to brewing hot coffee, this system can make hot tea, iced tea, and  cold brew coffee . You can choose from among 6 brew sizes, including a standard single-cup (237-mL) serving, a larger travel mug serving, a half carafe (5 cups or 1.2 L), and a full 10-cup (2.5-L) carafe.
The machine features a fold-away milk frother that allows you to froth hot or cold milk so you can make your own  matcha  tea lattes, flat whites, and lattes.
While the unit gets good reviews for flavor and ease of use, it does not have a warming plate. So, unless you’re brewing into the thermal carafe, you may want to use an insulated mug to help keep your beverage hot.

If you’re looking for an 8-cup coffee maker that won’t take up too much counter space, you may have found it.
According to one of our coffee aficionados, this relatively compact machine is a good fit for anyone who wants a straightforward coffee maker that brews a good cup of coffee. “If you’re looking to convert from pour-over brewing, this may be a good option,” they say.
It brews up to 8 cups in 5–10 minutes and works with just one button.
“ After brewing by pour-over methods for years with little counter space, I wanted something that was less manual. I did all the things; I researched, watched videos, read reviews and customer feedback. The Bonavita brewer that I have has been in almost daily use for a year and a half.”
They also say that the double-walled stainless steel thermal  carafe  keeps coffee warm all day.

Best espresso makers
Unlike coffee machines, espresso makers use high pressure to quickly force very hot water through finely ground beans. The result is a more concentrated shot of coffee that, when properly brewed, still has a smooth, balanced flavor.
When shopping for an espresso machine, one of the main decisions you need to make is whether to buy one that uses pods or finely ground beans.
While pods are more convenient, they’re not environmentally friendly. Additionally, some people prefer the taste of ground beans, especially freshly ground ones.
Other factors to consider include your budget, how many shots of espresso you want to make at a time, and how much counter space you have available.

While it comes with a hefty price tag, this Breville model boasts everything you need to brew the perfect cup of  espresso  — minus the beans.
It includes a tamper to pack the beans evenly into the basket, a built-in coffee grinder, a  frothing wand , a frothing pitcher, and even the tools you need to clean the machine properly.
Another convenient feature is that the Breville automatically adjusts the water temperature to properly extract the beans’ flavor.
You can choose whether to make a single or double shot so that the grinder gives you just the right amount of ground beans.
This machine is easy to use and customizable, and reviewers praise it for producing a cup of espresso that’s perfectly smooth, full-bodied, and well balanced.
The frothing wand also gets great reviews for producing a micro-foam texture that allows you to create your own latte art. This model comes with a 1-year warranty.

Pods are single-serving containers of pre-ground coffee or espresso beans and are typically designed to be brand-specific. While they’re more expensive than whole beans, many people appreciate their convenience factor.
Nespresso produces espresso makers and pods. While the company offers several models, the Breville Nespresso Creatista Uno is one of the best options, as it combines the convenience and flavor of Nespresso’s machines and pods with Breville’s micro-foam milk technology.
Ready to start brewing in as little as 3 seconds, this machine gets great reviews for ease of use, espresso quality, and customizable milk frothing temperatures. It also takes up less space on your counter than many other machines.
Nespresso has an expansive line of capsules, including various strengths of espresso-style beans, single-origin capsules,  decaffeinated  pods, and lungo capsules, which are used for making espresso with double the amount of water.

Best single-cup coffee makers
Some drip coffee makers can make small batches of coffee, but if you typically make only one cup at a time, a single-cup coffee maker can be a more convenient option.
As with espresso machines, when shopping for a single-cup coffee maker, the first decision you’ll need to make is whether you want to use pods or ground coffee. You’ll also want to consider the price and size of the unit.

It’s nice to have options. This machine by OXO brews up to 8 cups but comes with a single-serve accessory, so you can make just one cup of coffee if you prefer.
According to one coffee drinker we spoke with, it’s the perfect machine for both set-and-forget brewing and single-cup pour-overs.
This is another space-saving option that should sit neatly under cabinets and won’t hog your counter. The thermal carafe is made from double-walled stainless steel to prevent heat loss.

One of our editors has been using this single-beverage machine for more than a year and tells us it consistently produces delicious cups of coffee that feel like a treat in the morning.
“Even without any creamer or frothed milk, the top is always frothy,” she says. “I really love that you can purchase either espresso shot pods or full beverage pods (7.7 fluid ounces), giving the option to either make an espresso drink (latte, cappuccino) or a regular coffee beverage at home.”
However, the Nespresso coffee pods (capsules) are a bit expensive, retailing for about $11 for 8 pods.
Another coffee lover we talked to also loves the Nespresso Vertuo: “The double shots have been my tried and true lately, and I love the  recycling program .”

Best French press coffee makers
A French press is a coffee-brewing device in which coarsely ground coffee beans are steeped in hot water for several minutes before a mesh plunger is pressed down to contain the grounds in the bottom of the container.
When shopping for a French press, you’ll choose whether you want a glass, plastic, or stainless steel carafe. While glass carafes are easy to clean and allow you to see how much water you’re pouring in, stainless steel carafes tend to keep the coffee hotter longer.
Other factors to consider include the sturdiness of the handle, the quality of the metal screen on the plunger, the carafe volume, and your budget.

The Frieling French Press Coffee Maker is the best overall choice, as it’s made with a double layer of high quality stainless steel, which the company claims is four times better at keeping your coffee piping hot than glass models.
Inside, it has a two-stage filter system to help prevent the coffee grounds from ending up in your cup.
The Frieling French Press is available in 17-oz (0.5-L), 23-oz (0.7-L), 36-oz (1-L), and 40-oz (1.2-L) capacities. It’s dishwasher-safe and comes with a 5-year warranty.

For a less expensive option, the Veken French Press Coffee Maker is one of the best choices.
Available in three colors, the Veken features a glass carafe with a precise measuring line to make it easier to prepare the exact amount of coffee you need. It also has a double stainless steel filter to reduce the amount of sediment that ends up in your cup.
In addition to the press itself, the Veken comes with a frothing wand, a wooden spoon for stirring, a measuring spoon, a cleaning brush, and four filter screens.

Best pour-over coffee makers
Pour-over is a manual method of making coffee. First, you place coffee beans in a cone-shaped container with a hole in the bottom so the brewed coffee can flow into a mug or serving container below. Then, you slowly pour hot water over the ground beans to extract their flavor.
Because making pour-over coffee requires precision, you’ll also need a coffee grinder, gram scale, and teakettle. Some people use a thermometer to make sure the water temperature is consistent each time.

For making a single cup of pour-over coffee, the Kalita Wave is the best overall choice, as it’s easy to use and consistently results in a full-bodied, flavorful cup.
Unlike many other pour-over makers, the Kalita Wave has a flat bottom that helps maintain a more uniform flavor extraction from the beans.
The flat bottom also makes it an easier pour-over maker to use, since you don’t have to be quite as precise with the timing of your pouring.
The Kalita Wave fits over most mug sizes and comes in glass, stainless steel, and ceramic versions.

The Chemex is probably the most iconic pour-over coffee maker. Its elegant design features a signature hourglass-shaped glass flask and wooden handle. It’s a favorite among boutique coffee shops for producing coffee with full-bodied, clean flavor.
One advocate says the Chemex is distinctly different from other brew methods: “I think the Chemex carafe being glass avoids introducing other flavors from the material (plastic, metal, etc.).”
Unlike the Kalita, the Chemex uses thicker filters, which reduce the amount of natural oils from the coffee beans that ends up in the coffee. While some people prefer the cleaner flavor of coffee made in the Chemex, others may miss the Kalita’s thicker coffee.
Easy to use and clean, the Chemex comes in a variety of sizes, so it’s a good option if you’re making coffee for more than just yourself.
If you’d like to get a bit fancy, the  Chemex Ottomatic  is a lavish upgrade our coffee aficionados love. One of our reviewers says it brings the full body of the beans without a burnt smell or taste: “With the Ottomatic, the showerhead style of water delivery makes it much more flavorful.”
But keep in mind that the price tag is lavish too.

If you’re a pour-over pro, you’ll probably appreciate and feel pretty comfortable using the Hario V60 coffee dripper.
One of our editors uses both the ceramic and glass versions of the V60 and says they are sturdy, long lasting, and reliable: “The V60 produces some amazing coffee if you have the time in your day for a pour-over.”
She says this dripper is best for experienced pour-over makers, those who want an affordable option, and folks with time to make pour-over, noting that while it’s not super involved, it’s still more manual than a drip coffee maker.
“I find the habit of hand-pouring my own coffee to be a great ritual in the mornings, especially on the weekend,” she says. “When I still worked in an office, I stored it there and used it to make single cups for myself, which is nice when you don’t want leftover.”

Best cold brew coffee makers
Cold brew is a method of making coffee in which ground coffee beans are steeped in water for 12–24 hours. The resulting beverage is typically smoother and less bitter than traditional hot or iced coffee.
Most cold brew makers produce a coffee concentrate that you then mix with water or milk. You can adjust the strength of your cold brew by adjusting the ratio of concentrate to water or milk.

The OXO Good Grips 32-Ounce Cold Brew Coffee Maker is the best overall option, as it’s easy to use and consistently produces a flavorful cold brew concentrate.
Unlike many other  cold brew  makers, the OXO stands out in that after the ground coffee beans are added to the coffee bowl, water is poured through a perforated “rainmaker” top that evenly distributes water over the coffee grounds.
As a result, the OXO can extract as much flavor as possible from the ground beans. After letting it steep for 12–24 hours, you simply press a switch to filter the concentrate into a glass beaker, which you can then seal and store in the fridge.
This OXO model can hold up to 32 oz (0.9 L) of concentrate and gets great reviews for the flavor and overall quality of its cold brew. It comes with a lifetime warranty.

While the OXO isn’t overly expensive, the Hario Mizudashi Cold Brew Coffee Pot is generally about half the price and still delivers a full-bodied cold brew concentrate.
The Hario Mizudashi Cold Brew Coffee Pot is easy to use, as you simply place ground coffee beans and water in the provided filter, stir, and allow the grounds to steep for 8–24 hours.
This cold brew maker features a compact glass container that won’t take up much room in your fridge. However, because it’s glass, you’ll want to be careful not to bump it or place it in an area of the fridge where it can easily get knocked over.
The Hario Mizudashi can hold up to 32 oz (0.9 L) of cold brew concentrate, which gets rave reviews for its flavor and lack of bitterness.

Best coffee percolator
A coffee percolator is a type of coffee maker that brews coffee by cycling boiling water through coffee grounds multiple times. As a result, percolated coffee is often very strong and very hot, and it can be quite  bitter .
When buying a percolator, you’ll need to decide between a stovetop unit and an electric unit (we’ve chosen a stovetop unit here). You’ll also want to consider the volume, price, quality of materials, and ease of cleaning.

The Farberware Classic Stainless Steel Coffee Percolator is the best stovetop option, as it’s made with heavy-duty stainless steel to keep your coffee nice and hot. Plus, it’s dishwasher-safe.
It features a permanent percolator filter basket, which eliminates the mess of using disposable paper filters.
Reviewers like its classic design, comfortable handle, and quality coffee.
Available in 8-cup (1.9-L) and 12-cup (2.8-L) sizes, this stovetop coffee maker is also a good option to use when  camping .

While similar to a stovetop percolator, a moka espresso pot has three distinct chambers, extracts the beans once, and uses finely ground beans, resulting in an espresso-like taste and texture.
The Cuisinox Roma Stainless Steel Stovetop Moka Espresso Maker is the best stovetop coffee maker because it’s made with durable, high quality stainless steel. It’s also unique in that it has an induction base that allows it to be used on both gas and electric stovetops.
Reviewers love this stovetop coffee maker for its consistently high quality brew, ease of cleaning, and 25-year warranty. Just note that, to get the best flavor, Cuisinox recommends using  filtered water  rather than tap water to make your coffee.

This one is a multitasker, ideal for outdoor adventures. It’s compatible with the brand’s  canister-style stove , which can boil 1.8 L of water in about 4 minutes, according to the manufacturer.
Adding the Jetboil Grande Silicone Coffee Press to the cooking system will prepare a pot of coffee for your group. It serves 2–4 people and is reasonably simple to use thanks to its push-button igniter.
“I love this thing for backpacking or camping,” one Healthline editor says. “I bought this to make coffee in my  Jetboil  on backpacking trips. The coffee it produces tastes much better than instant (my other backpacking go-to), but it’s still lightweight and easy to store and use.”

Comparison of the best coffee makers

How to choose
When shopping for a coffee machine, it’s important to know what your ideal cup of coffee tastes like, including your ideal temperature. That can help you narrow down the brewing method.
For example, if you enjoy lattes and cappuccinos, you’ll want to purchase a machine that can make a number of different espresso drinks. If you enjoy a plain, strong cup of coffee with no frills, a French press might be your best bet.
From there, you may want to consider the following factors:
the volume of coffee a machine brews
whether the machine has programmable settings
brew time
price
size
additional features, such as a frothing wand

And don’t forget that the coffee maker is just one piece of the equation. For the best cup of coffee possible, you may want to consider investing in a coffee grinder and high quality beans.

Frequently asked questions about coffee makers
There are many ways to make a cup of coffee.
The most common types of coffee makers are:
drip coffee makers
pour-over coffee makers
capsule coffee makers
French press coffee makers
cold brew coffee makers
espresso machines
grind-and-brew coffee makers
stovetop coffee makers
percolator coffee makers
No — espresso machines make espresso and espresso drinks, such as lattes and cappuccinos, while coffee makers produce regular coffee.
Espresso is much darker, richer, and thicker than coffee because it’s more concentrated.
Espresso machines are usually much more expensive than coffee makers and more complicated to use.
The answer here depends on who you ask.
Coffee enthusiasts tend to value high quality machines that come with higher price tags. Buying a high quality machine usually means your device will produce better-tasting coffee and last longer than a basic model.
It’s a good idea to consider your needs when shopping. If you know you don’t need espresso shots or a milk frother, you can skip those features and focus on brands that have a positive reputation and high praise from reviewers.
Many people think of a coffee machine as an investment, whether they consider themselves coffee aficionados or not, since most coffee drinkers use their machines daily. A high quality machine may cost more up front, but it may be worth it so you don’t have to replace your machine every year.
It will depend on the quality of the coffee maker you choose, but the average life of many is about 5 years, and some models can last longer.

The bottom line
When it comes to making  coffee , there are many ways to brew your perfect cup.
With so many options available — such as automatic drip coffee makers, espresso machines, and manual pour-overs — it can be overwhelming to figure out which coffee maker to buy.
