Title: 8 Scrumptious, Nutritious Dishes from Across India

Indian cuisine has offered the world innumerable gastronomic greats — and shaped my kitchen in particular. From butter chicken to rogan josh to biryani, there are plenty of delicious Indian dishes to spice up one’s palate.
The ingredients and styles of cooking in Indian cuisine vary based on region, season, religion, and family tradition.
You can find everything from meat-based curries to vegetarian and vegan dishes, as well as an assortment of spices and ingredients that give each dish its distinct flavor profile.
India’s food culture has evolved through substantial interactions with neighboring Persia, ancient Greece, and the Middle East, responding to centuries of cross-cultural exchange ( 1 ).
The resulting dishes are renowned for their rich, spicy flavors and complex aromas. However, the cuisine isn’t just about taste — dishes across the Indian subcontinent are packed with nutrients, meaning they’re also very healthy options.
Here are 8 delicious and nourishing Indian dishes to try.
It’s important to remember that cultural identity is intertwined with health, and  culture cannot be ignored  when considering which foods or dishes are healthy. When it comes to food choices, the concept of “healthy” is subjective and personal.
Many Eurocentric ideas of healthy eating exclude other cultures, which is problematic and perpetuates unhealthy ways of thinking about food.
As a registered dietitian, I believe that healthy dishes use wholesome, minimally processed ingredients, are  based primarily around plant foods , and bring you joy.
Indian cuisine — like other South Asian styles of eating — consists of much more than just curry.
A multitude of Indian dishes are cooked from scratch, use ingredients that are close to their original forms, and feature masterful use of spices and cooking techniques. All this gives each dish unique flavors and textures.
Trying to condense the vast cuisine of India into what Westerners call “curry” or “masala” — which really refer to nothing other than spice mixtures in Western culture — is like trying to condense the cuisine of Italy into spaghetti Bolognese.

1–2. Breakfast
Chillas are a savory Indian dish closely resembling pancakes. They are infused with spices and served with Indian pickles, sour cream, or plain yogurt. Chillas can also be adorned with chopped cucumber and tomatoes, but they’re just as good on their own.
Chillas are usually prepared with  chickpea flour  (besan) but can also be made out of sprouted mung beans.
Mung beans are a legume that’s eaten worldwide but especially in Asian countries.
Besides being a rich source of plant-based protein,  mung beans  contain a variety of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that have been shown to combat diseases such as diabetes .  Test-tube studies suggest that they may provide anticancer benefits as well ( 2 ,  3 ).
All the same, more human studies are needed.
A  popular Indian breakfast dish, poha is made of flattened, flaked  rice  that’s soaked in water and then tempered in onions and a medley of spices.
When topped with peanuts and peas, it has a delightful texture.
These add-ins boost the nutritional value of the dish, providing calcium and iron alongside fiber and protein, which may help you  feel full longer  ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ).

3–6. Lunch and dinner
Chole masala is an Indian dish primarily made of chickpeas simmered in spiced tomato sauce.
It pairs beautifully with roti (Indian flatbread), bhatura (deep-fried puffed bread), or naan (Indian flatbread typically cooked in a clay oven).
The word “masala” means “spice mix.” Spices such as  cumin , garlic powder, chili flakes, turmeric, coriander seeds, and black peppercorns typically make an appearance in chole masala.
Like other types of legumes, chickpeas are high in protein. They provide substantial amounts of eight of the nine essential amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein. This means they’re a solid pick for  vegetarian diets  ( 7 ).
Along with numerous vitamins and minerals, chickpeas offer a significant portion of heart-healthy fiber. Studies have found that people with or without diabetes who eat more chickpeas are less likely to develop heart disease ( 7 ,  8 ).
Perhaps the heartiest of Indian dishes, daal is a fragrant lentil curry flavored with cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, garam masala, and other spices.
Daal can be made with a variety of  lentils , such as toor daal (split pigeon peas), masoor daal (red lentils), and chana daal (chickpeas). Traditionally, it’s eaten with rice, naan, or roti. It can be served with Indian vegetables and enjoyed as a soup.
For vegetarians, daal can form the basis of a high protein meal.
Compared with other legumes, lentils have the highest insoluble fiber content, as well as high quantities of prebiotic carbohydrates.
Insoluble fiber passes through your gut undigested to help promote bowel regularity. And prebiotic carbs support the growth of gut-friendly  probiotics , which may be beneficial for mental health ( 9 ,  10 ).
That’s because the gut and brain communicate closely, forming the “gut-brain axis.” Notably, gut bacteria may increase the production of mood-enhancing brain chemicals such as dopamine and serotonin ( 11 ).
Prepared with tender fish, zesty spices, and creamy coconut milk, Alleppey fish curry is a popular Indian dish that brims with sweet and sour flavors.
It comes from the Alleppey District of the Indian state of Kerala, which is known for its delightfully fragrant fish curries. The type of fish is most often Indian mackerel or kingfish, and it’s typically enriched with  tamarind  or green mangoes.
Numerous studies link  fish intake  to heart health ( 12 ).
According to one review, people who eat fish multiple times per week have a reduced risk of death from heart disease. Similarly, a review of 24 studies in 714,526 people associated eating non-fried fish with a reduced risk of heart disease ( 13 ,  14 ).
The fragrant spices and flavors of India are encapsulated in jalfrezi, a currylike stir-fry known for its many variations. Indeed, cooks from across the world have their own versions of this dish.
Jalfrezi incorporates protein such as chicken or shrimp alongside bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes. Ginger gives it an aromatic flavor, and cloves, cumin, and chiles add a kick that leaves your mouth watering with each bite.
Bell peppers  are one of the richest sources of vitamin C, which is essential for several bodily processes, including collagen synthesis and iron absorption ( 15 ,  16 ).
This vitamin is also a powerful antioxidant that helps protect your cells from unstable molecules called free radicals and helps maintain immune health ( 17 ).

7–8. Sides
Masala bhindi is a mouthwatering Indian side dish. The star ingredient is  okra , which is called “bhindi” in Hindi.
It’s prepared in a spicy tomato-based sauce and served with roti or naan.
Okra is high in dietary fiber, which is associated with better blood sugar control. In particular, eating  high fiber foods  is an important strategy for people who are managing diabetes ( 18 ).
While further research in humans is needed, one review suggests that okra has various antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which may be helpful in managing symptoms of metabolic syndrome ( 19 ,  20 ).
Metabolic syndrome is a group of interrelated conditions such as increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and high cholesterol levels — all of which can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.
Baingan bharta is a thrill for the taste buds. It’s made from peeled, mashed  eggplants  that are oven-roasted or cooked on the stove and then added to a marvelously thick tomato sauce infused with spices such as turmeric and chile.
Turmeric is rich in curcumin, a compound known for its anti-inflammatory properties. In fact, curcumin has been shown to benefit people with inflammatory conditions such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and arthritis — though the exact mechanism is unclear ( 21 ,  22 ).
Thus, further research in humans is needed.
