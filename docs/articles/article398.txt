Title: What Is Imitation Crab and Should You Eat It?

Imitation crab is made from surimi, which is fish flesh that has been deboned, then minced into a paste, and mixed with other ingredients. It’s an affordable alternative to real crab, but it’s highly processed and lower in certain nutrients.
Chances are, you’ve eaten imitation crab — even if you didn’t realize it.
This crab stand-in has become popular over the past few decades and is commonly found in seafood salad, crab cakes, California sushi rolls, and crab rangoons.
In short, imitation crab is processed fish meat — in fact, it’s sometimes called “the hot dog of the sea.” However, you may still wonder what it’s made from and whether it’s healthy.
This article explains everything you need to know about imitation crab.

What Is imitation crab?
Imitation crab is made from surimi, which is fish flesh that has been deboned, washed to remove fat and unwanted bits, then minced into a paste. This paste is blended with other ingredients before being heated and pressed into shapes that mimic crab meat ( 1 ).
While imitation crab is made from seafood, it generally contains no crab, other than a tiny amount of crab extract that is sometimes added for flavoring.
Pollock, which has a mild color and odor, is commonly used to make surimi. This  fish  is also used to make fish sticks and other breaded fish products ( 1 ).
Packages of crab-like products may be  labeled  “imitation crab” or “fish protein blending with crab,” but must follow government labeling rules. In Japan, surimi-based seafood is often called kamaboko.
On restaurant menus, imitation crab may be spelled “krab” to indicate that it’s fake.
Imitation crab is made from surimi, which is minced fish flesh — often pollock — that has been deboned and washed, then combined with other ingredients, heated, and formed into crab-like cuts.

Nutritionally inferior to real crab
Real crab is significantly higher in several nutrients compared to imitation crab.
Here’s how 3 ounces, or 85 grams (g), of imitation and cooked Alaska king crab compare ( 2 ,  3 ):
Though both have a similar number of calories, 63% of imitation crab calories come from carbs, whereas 80% of Alaska king crab calories come from protein — with none from carbs ( 2 ,  3 ).
If you’re trying to increase your protein intake and reduce your carb intake — for instance, if you’re on a low carb or  ketogenic diet  — real crab may better fit your goals.
Compared to imitation crab, real crab is also significantly higher in several vitamins and minerals — including vitamin B12, zinc, and  selenium .
This is partly because pollock, the main fish used to make imitation crab is lower in these nutrients. Additionally, imitation crab contains a blend of ingredients that don’t contain these vitamins or minerals, including added starch and sugar ( 4 ).
On the other hand, real crab tends to be  higher in sodium  than imitation crab, though both make a big contribution toward the daily limit of 2,300 mg. Salt is often added to both real and imitation crab, though the amount varies by brand ( 5 ).
Lastly, real crab is generally higher in  omega-3 fatty acids  than imitation crab. Though omega-3-rich oil could be added to imitation crab, this isn’t common ( 6 ,  7 ).
Despite a similar calorie count, imitation crab is higher in carbs and lower in protein, omega-3 fats, and several vitamins and minerals than real crab.

Made from many ingredients
The main ingredient in imitation crab is surimi, which generally comprises 35%–50% of the product by weight ( 8 ).
The other major ingredients in imitation crab are ( 1 ):
Water:  Generally the second most abundant ingredient in imitation crab, water is needed to get the right texture and control product costs.
Starch:  Potato, wheat, corn, or tapioca starch are often used to firm up the surimi and make it freezable. However, if excess starch is used in order to cut costs, the product can become sticky and soft.
Protein:  Egg white  protein is most common, but other proteins, such as soy, may be used. These boost the protein content of imitation crab and improve its texture, color, and glossiness.
Sugar and sorbitol:  These help the product hold up to freezing and thawing. They also contribute a little sweetness.
Vegetable oil:  Sunflower, soybean, or other  vegetable oils  are sometimes used to improve the texture, white color, and shelf life. Some brands may also use fish oil instead.
Salt (sodium chloride):  Aside from adding flavor, salt helps the minced fish form a sturdy gel. Potassium chloride, which performs the same functions, may be substituted for some of the salt.
After combining these ingredients with preservatives and other additives, the crab mixture is cooked and pressed into the desired shapes, as well as vacuum sealed and pasteurized to kill potentially harmful bacteria ( 9 ).
The main ingredient in imitation crab is surimi, which is typically mixed with water, starch, sugar, egg whites, vegetable oil, salt, and additives.

Contains colorings, preservatives, and other additives
Several  additives  — including some you may prefer to avoid — are generally added to imitation crab to achieve the desired color, flavor, and stability.
Common additives in imitation crab include ( 10 ):
Gums:  These help the ingredients stick together and stabilize the product. Examples include carrageenan and  xanthan gum .
Red colorants:  Carmine — which is extracted from tiny bugs called cochineals — is widely used to color imitation crab red. Paprika, beet juice extract, and lycopene from tomatoes may also be used.
Glutamates:  Monosodium glutamate (MSG) and a similar compound, disodium inosinate, may serve as flavor enhancers.
Other flavorings:  These may include real crab extract, artificial crab flavorings, and mirin (fermented rice wine).
Preservatives:  Sodium benzoate  and several phosphate-based additives are regularly used to improve shelf life.
Though generally recognized as safe by the FDA, some of these additives are associated with health concerns and may need further study ( 11 ).
For example, MSG may cause headaches in some people, though the evidence for any harmful effects of its use is very weak ( 12 ).
Meanwhile,  carrageenan  is linked to intestinal damage and inflammation in animal and test-tube studies ( 13 ,  14 ).
Furthermore, people with kidney disease are typically advised to avoid foods with added phosphates ( 15 ).
Several additives are used in imitation crab to achieve the desired color, flavor, and stability. Some of these are linked to potential health concerns.

Potential upsides
There are several reasons imitation crab is popular. One is its affordable price, as imitation crab is typically significantly cheaper than real crab.
Imitation crab is also convenient, as it can be added to dishes without further preparation. Additionally, some imitation crab sticks are packaged in grab-and-go, snack-sized portions with dipping sauce.
In addition, some imitation crab products are  gluten-free  and made without genetically modified (GMO) ingredients. What’s more, some mock crab may be certified to indicate that the seafood was sustainably sourced.
However, these more natural products cost more and aren’t as widely available.
Imitation crab is affordable and convenient. A few brands are gluten-free or made without GMOs, but you’ll pay extra for them.

Potential downsides
Aside from the fact that imitation crab is a highly processed and less nutritious version of real crab, it also carries environmental, mislabeling, and allergenic concerns.
Certain species of pollock that are used to make surimi have been overfished — endangering animals such as Steller sea lions that eat pollock — or are caught in ways that damage habitats of other sea life ( 16 ,  17 ).
That said, other varieties of pollock are considered sustainable and surimi manufacturers are increasingly using other types of white-fleshed seafood, such as cod, Pacific whiting, and squid ( 10 ,  18 ,  19 ).
It’s also possible to use non-fish meats, such as deboned chicken, beef, or  pork  to make surimi — though this is uncommon ( 20 ,  21 ,  22 ).
Another environmental problem is that the minced fish meat used to make surimi is washed several times to improve color, texture, and smell. This uses a lot of water and generates wastewater, which must be treated so that it doesn’t contaminate oceans and harm fish ( 20 ).
Some imitation crab products don’t list seafood ingredients accurately, which increases food safety and allergy risks.
It’s impossible to know the actual ingredients without special testing.
When 16 surimi-based products purchased in Spain and Italy were tested, 25% listed a fish species different from that identified by DNA analysis.
Most of the mislabeled products were imported from Asian countries. Some labels failed to even note that the surimi was made from fish — a  top food allergen . Food allergy labeling is required in European countries and in the United States, including for imported foods ( 10 ,  23 ).
Inaccurate and inadequate product labels increase your risk of an allergic reaction to an ingredient that isn’t properly disclosed.
Mislabeling also conceals potentially toxic fish. In fact, two of the mislabeled Asian surimi products contained a species of fish linked with ciguatera poisoning, the most frequently reported toxin-based seafood illness ( 10 ,  24 ).
If you have food allergies, it may be best to avoid unlabeled imitation crab — such as in appetizers at a party — as it may harbor common allergens including fish, crab extract, eggs, and  wheat .
Pollock used in surimi is sometimes harvested in ways that can harm other sea life, and imitation crab production uses excessive amounts of water. Seafood used in imitation crab is sometimes mislabeled, which can increase food safety and allergy risks.

Simple to use
You can find imitation crab either in the refrigerated or frozen section of stores. They sell several types, including flake-style, chunks, sticks, and shreds.
Since imitation crab is precooked, you can use it straight from the package for cold dishes, such as dips and salad, or add it to dishes you heat.
Here are multiple ways to use imitation crab, categorized by type:
dips
spreads
cold crab salad
crab cakes
sautées
stir-fries
pasta  dishes
casseroles
quiches
chowders
quesadillas
pizza topping
appetizers with cocktail sauce
California-style sushi rolls
sandwich wraps
leafy green  salad topping
crab cakes
lettuce wraps
enchilada meat
fish tacos
Recipes for imitation crab dishes can often be found on manufacturers’ websites.
Imitation crab is quite versatile. However, given its nutrition and health considerations, it should be enjoyed in moderation alongside a variety of other  protein sources  in your diet.
Because it’s precooked and available in several different cuts, imitation crab is easy to use in appetizers, salads, and main dishes.

The bottom line
Imitation crab is a  highly processed food  made by combining minced fish with starch, egg whites, sugar, salt, and additives to mimic the flavor, color, and texture of real crab meat.
While it’s significantly less expensive than real crab, it’s also less nutritious.
If you’re making a dish for a special occasion and don’t have the budget for real crab, imitation crab is a good alternative that’s simple to use.
However, for day-to-day meals, opt for affordable, minimally processed and nutritious proteins, such as cod, chicken, and lean beef.
