Title: How Long Does Pasta Last in the Fridge?

Pasta is traditionally made from wheat, but there are other types made from things like peas, lentils, beans, and other gluten-free ingredients. The expected fridge life of pasta depends on what it’s made of.
While dried pasta can last in your pantry for years, you may wonder exactly how long it keeps in the fridge once it has been cooked.
This article reviews how long different types of pasta last in the fridge, as well as the best storage practices to keep them fresh as long as possible.

How long different types of pasta last in the fridge
Just like other precooked foods and leftovers, cooked pasta should be stored in the fridge.
This is because cooked pasta contains moisture that will eventually lead to  mold growth , and cooler temperatures slow the expiration process ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
It’s helpful to know how long you can expect different types and preparations of pasta to last in the fridge before they should be discarded.
Here’s how long some of the most popular types of pasta will last in the fridge ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ):
Fresh homemade wheat pasta:  4–5 days
Fresh store-bought wheat pasta:  1–3 days
Cooked wheat pasta:  3–5 days
Lentil-, bean-, or pea-based pasta:  3–5 days
Gluten-free pasta:  3–5 days
Tortellini or other stuffed pasta:  3–5 days
Lasagna or other cooked pasta with sauce:  5 days
Note that these are general expectations, and individual dishes may vary, but you can assume that most cooked pasta lasts for less than 1 week.
It’s still important to examine your pasta and make sure there are no signs of spoilage before you eat it.
Cooked and fresh homemade pasta should be stored in the refrigerator to slow mold growth and preserve its freshness as long as possible. Most pastas last in the fridge for 3–5 days.

Signs that pasta has gone bad
You can usually tell whether your pasta has gone bad by looking at it and feeling it.
One of the most telling signs of expired pasta is that it has become slimy or gooey, which usually occurs right before visible mold begins to grow.
You may also notice that it has a dullness or discoloration, such as a grayish or whitish hue.
Sometimes you may even be able to smell that your pasta has started to go bad and should be thrown out.
Eating old pasta could make you sick if harmful germs are growing on it, and doing so may affect people differently.
You may experience  symptoms of food poisoning  that range from mild to severe, depending on what’s growing on the pasta you ate.
The most frequent symptoms of foodborne illness are gastrointestinal in nature, causing upset stomach, diarrhea, and vomiting ( 7 ).
One of the most common foodborne pathogens that can grow on old pasta is  B. cereus , which can cause cramps, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. In severe cases, this bacteria has even been known to cause death ( 8 ,  9 ).
If you eat old pasta that has other ingredients in it, such as meat,  eggs , or dairy products, it’s more likely to be exposed to other common germs like  Salmonella, Campylobacter, Clostridium,  or  Listeria  as well ( 7 ).
To minimize your risk of foodborne illness from eating leftover pasta, it’s best to follow the general shelf-life expectations above, examine your pasta before eating it, and practice proper storage techniques.
Eating expired pasta comes with the risk of an array of foodborne illnesses, which can cause upset stomach, diarrhea, and vomiting. Look for signs of spoilage before eating leftover cooked pasta.

The best way to store pasta
Once you have cooked pasta, let any leftovers cool thoroughly and then store it in the fridge within 2 hours of being cooked.
Moisture trapped when warm pasta is sealed up and placed in the fridge can create the perfect environment for bacteria or mold to grow ( 2 ,  3 ).
Pasta in the fridge should be stored in shallow, airtight containers or resealable bags.
It can be helpful to toss the leftover cooked noodles in a bit of  olive oil  to prevent them from sticking together too much in the fridge.
Lastly, be sure to keep your refrigerator at 40°F (4°C) or lower to preserve cold foods ( 3 ).
When you’re ready to enjoy leftover pasta, you can either enjoy it straight from the fridge cold or  reheat  it using a few recommended methods.
If you’re eating plain pasta without sauce, you can reheat it by placing it in a strainer and submerging it into boiling water for approximately 30–60 seconds.
Leftover pasta with sauce can be placed in a heat-safe dish and baked in the oven for approximately 20 minutes at 350°F (176°C).
It can also be placed in a skillet on the stovetop and warmed over medium heat, stirring gently to heat it thoroughly.
A covered microwave-safe dish can also work well for leftover pasta, using your microwave’s reheat settings and gently stirring until there are no cold spots.
As long as your pasta has been properly refrigerated at 40°F (4°C) and you’re enjoying leftovers in a timely manner, there’s a low risk of bacterial contamination if you want to eat it cold.
If reheating, be sure to heat it thoroughly to at least 165°F (74°C) and eat it within 2 hours to prevent bacterial growth ( 10 ).
To optimize its shelf life, cooked pasta should be stored in the refrigerator at 40°F (4°C) or lower in an airtight container or resealable bag. Leftovers can be enjoyed cold or reheated using boiling water, the stovetop, microwave, or oven.

The bottom line
Pasta is a popular food around the world, and it’s made from a number of bases, such as wheat, legumes, and  gluten-free grains .
While dried pasta has a long shelf life in the pantry, cooked and fresh homemade pasta should be eaten somewhat quickly. Most cooked pasta only lasts in the fridge for between 3–5 days before it starts to show signs of expiration.
Eating expired pasta comes with risks similar to those associated with eating other expired foods, such as foodborne illness.
This makes it important to follow proper handling, preparation, and fridge storage techniques, as well as eat your cooked  pasta  in a reasonable time frame.
