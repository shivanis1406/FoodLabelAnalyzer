Having nutritious snacks to eat during the workday can help you stay energized and productive. Some snacks include nuts, roasted chickpeas, guacamole, and baked veggie chips, among others.
Here are 33 simple and healthy snacks for work.

1. Nuts and dried fruit
Nuts  and dried fruit make for a healthy, non-perishable snack mix.
This combo has a good balance of all three macronutrients, with healthy fats and protein from nuts and carbs from dried fruit. They’re also loaded with fiber, which can help you  feel full  between meals.

2. Bell peppers and guacamole
Guacamole is a delicious dip typically made from  avocados ,  lime ,  onion , and  cilantro . It goes great with bell pepper slices or other raw veggies.
Avocados also contain various nutrients like  monounsaturated fats  and fiber, which have been associated with  increased heart health .

3. Brown rice cakes and avocado
Brown  rice cakes  are an excellent, shelf-stable snack for the office. One brown rice cake (9 grams (g)) provides  7 g  of carbs and 1.35% of the Daily Value (DV) for fiber for only 35 calories.
The authors of a large  2022 study  found that those who ate more than two avocados per week had a 16% and 21% lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease, respectively.
Be sure to look for rice cakes that are made with only rice and don’t have unnecessary ingredients.

4. Roasted chickpeas
Roasted  chickpeas  are a non-perishable snack that’s high in protein, fiber, and several vitamins and minerals.
A 1/2 cup (76 g) of chickpeas has  5 g  of fiber and 5 g of protein. What’s more, due to their nutrient-dense profiles, they have been  associated with  aiding weight management, improving insulin response, and lowering your risk of certain diseases.
To make roasted chickpeas, drain a can of chickpeas and pat dry. Toss them in olive oil, sea salt, and seasonings of your choice. Bake on a lined baking sheet at 350℉ (180℃) for 40 minutes.

5. Tuna pouches
Vacuum-sealed tuna pouches are convenient snacks that don’t need to be drained and can be stored and eaten at work. Tuna is loaded with filling protein and  omega-3 fatty acids . These are known to  fight inflammation  and may decrease your risk of  heart disease .

6. Apples and peanut butter
Apple slices with natural  peanut butter  make for a delicious, satisfying snack.
Peanut butter contributes protein and healthy fats.  Apples  are high in fiber and water, making them particularly filling. In fact, 1 medium gala apple (100 g) is  86%  water and has more than 3.5 g of fiber.

7. Jerky
Jerky is a shelf-stable,  high protein snack .
One ounce (28 g) of beef jerky has  8 g  of protein for 116 calories. It’s also rich in iron, an important mineral for  maintaining blood health  and energy levels.
Look for jerky that is uncured, low in sodium, and made from few ingredients. You can also find turkey, chicken, and salmon jerky if you don’t eat red meat.

8. Homemade granola
Granola  keeps well in your desk drawer for a quick snack.
It’s best to make your own. Most store-bought varieties are high in  added sugars  and contain unhealthy vegetable oils that may  increase inflammation  in your body if consumed in excess.
Combine rolled oats,  sunflower seeds , dried  cranberries , and cashews in a mixture of melted  coconut oil  and honey. Then, spread the mix out on a lined baking sheet and bake for 40 minutes at low heat.

A 158 g container of plain, low fat Greek yogurt has  16 g  of protein for only 95 calories. Plus, it’s loaded with  calcium , a mineral that’s important for  strong bones  and teeth.
To make this treat even more tasty and filling, add healthy fruits and nuts.

You can bring pre-portioned servings of cottage cheese to work and top it with fruit, such as sliced berries.

13. Baked veggie chips
Baked or dehydrated veggie chips are a wholesome, shelf-stable snack. However, some store-bought varieties are made with highly refined  vegetable oils , such as  canola  or  soybean  oil, and contain unnecessary additives.
Making your own veggie chips allows you to control the ingredients you use.
Thinly slice sweet potatoes, beets, carrots, zucchini, or radishes and brush them with a small amount of olive oil. Bake on a lined baking sheet at 225℉ (110℃) for approximately 2 hours.

Roll spoonfuls of the mix into bite-sized balls and enjoy them as a treat throughout your workday.

16. Oatmeal packets
Keeping plain, unsweetened  oatmeal  packets at work is a great way to stay prepared with healthy snacks.
Plain oatmeal is high in beta-glucan. This is a  component of fiber  that’s been shown to help  lower cholesterol levels  and improve heart health.

17. Carrots and hummus

20. Clementines and almonds

21. String cheese
String cheese is a convenient snack full of nutrients.
