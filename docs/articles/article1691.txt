Title: 11 Healthy Foods That Help You Burn Fat

Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and certain antioxidants may help promote fat loss. Certain beverages, including coffee, also have metabolism-boosting properties.
Boosting your  metabolic rate  can help you lose  body fat .
However, most “fat-burning” supplements on the market are either unsafe, ineffective, or both.
Fortunately, several natural foods and beverages have been shown to  increase your metabolism  and promote fat loss.
Here are 11 healthy foods that may help you burn fat.

1. Fatty fish
Salmon , herring,  sardines , mackerel, and other fatty fish contain  omega-3 fatty acids , which  may help  you lose body fat.
Fish is also an excellent source of high quality protein, which may lead to  greater feelings of fullness  and  can help increase  your metabolic rate.
Most organizations recommend consuming  two servings (3 ounces (oz) each)  of fatty fish per week to see the health benefits.

2. MCT oil
Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) oil  is made by extracting MCTs from  palm oil . It’s a  type of fat  that’s metabolized differently than the long-chain fatty acids found in most foods.
Research suggests that MCTs  may help  increase metabolic rate,  reduce hunger , and promote better retention of muscle mass during weight loss.
Studies suggest that replacing fat in your diet with  1.5 – 2  tablespoons (tbsp) of MCT oil per day can boost fat burning. Try to start with 1 teaspoon (tsp) and gradually increase to avoid digestive side effects.

3. Coffee
Coffee  is one of the most popular beverages worldwide.
Coffee  a great source of  caffeine , which  may help  you burn fat. To get the fat-burning benefits of caffeine without the potential  side effects , such as anxiousness or insomnia, aim for no more than  400 mg per day.
This is the amount found in about 4–5 cups of coffee, depending on its strength. Some people are  more sensitive  to caffeine’s effects and may need to limit their intake.

4. Eggs
Although egg yolks have traditionally been avoided due to their high cholesterol content, whole  eggs  may help with  weight loss .
For one, they are very nutrient-dense and  contain  a lot of protein, which can help ward off hunger and overeating. For example, a 2017 study found that eating a high-protein diet reduced the subject’s hunger by  16%  while increasing daily fullness by 25%.
One of the reasons eggs are so filling may also be due to the boost in calorie burning that  occurs  during protein digestion.
Eating up to three eggs a week can help you burn fat while keeping you full and satisfied. More than this amount has been associated with a  higher chance of heart disease.

5. Green tea
In addition to providing a moderate amount of caffeine,  green tea  is an excellent source of  epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) , an antioxidant that  promotes  fat burning and the loss of belly fat.
Though  research  suggests that drinking green tea may help improve your metabolism and lower your body fat, more research is  necessary  to support these claims.
That said, drinking about  2-3 cups  of green tea daily may be optimal for providing the variety of health benefits.

6. Whey protein
Consuming  whey protein  may help you suppress appetite, especially because it  stimulates  the release of “ fullness hormones ,” such as PYY and GLP-1.
Moreover, whey  appears  to boost fat burning and promote weight loss. For this reason, a whey protein shake is a quick meal or snack option that promotes fat loss and may help improve your body composition.

7. Apple cider vinegar
Apple cider vinegar  is an ancient folk remedy with evidence-based health benefits.
Animal research  suggests that vinegar’s main component, acetic acid,  may help  increase fat burning and reduce belly fat storage in several animal studies. However, more human studies are needed to verify this.
Start with 1 tsp per day diluted in water and gradually work up to  1 tbsp  per day to minimize potential digestive discomfort.

8. Chili peppers
Chili peppers  contain  powerful antioxidants.  One of these is called  capsaicin , and cosuming it may help you achieve and maintain a healthy weight by promoting fullness and preventing overeating.
Consider eating chili peppers or using powdered  cayenne pepper  to spice up your meals several times a week.

9. Oolong tea
Oolong tea  is contains  polyphenols , which are compounds associated with helping reduce things like  blood sugar  and and  body weight.
Like other teas, it also contains caffeine, which  helps promote  weight and body fat loss.
Drinking a few cups of green tea, oolong tea, or a combination of the two on a regular basis may promote fat loss and provide other beneficial health effects.
That said, most  research  on oolong tea and weight loss is based on animals, so more human studies are needed.

10. Full-fat Greek yogurt
Full-fat  Greek yogurt  is extremely nutritious. First, it’s an  excellent source  of protein,  potassium , and  calcium .
Research  also suggests that eating high protein dairy products can boost weight and fat loss.
Eating  2 servings of dairy  such as Greek yogurt daily may provide a number of health benefits. But make sure to choose plain, full-fat Greek yogurt.

11. Olive oil
Olive oil  is one of the healthiest fats on earth.
Most of olive oil is composed of oleic acid, which  has been shown  to have a positive effect on fat and body mass.
To incorporate olive oil into your daily diet, drizzle a couple of tablespoons on your salad or add it to cooked food.

Frequently asked questions
Drinks that may help you lose fat  include tea, coffee, certain protein shakes, and vegetable juices.
Foods that may help losing belly fat  include high-fiber foods like fruit and vegetables, high-protein foods like eggs or beans, and fatty fish. Probiotics may also help.
To lose weight, you need to create a calorie deficit. This means eating fewer calories, increasing exercise, or a combination of both.
That said, while it’s possible to  lose 20 lb in a month , this isn’t sustainable and should only be attempted under the guidance of a doctor. It’s far healthier to gradually lose small amounts of weight over time.

The bottom line
Despite what certain supplement manufacturers may suggest, there isn’t a safe “magic pill” that can help you burn hundreds of extra calories per day.
However, a number of foods and beverages may modestly increase your metabolic rate in addition to providing other health benefits.
Including several of them in your daily diet may have effects that ultimately lead to fat loss and better overall health.
