Title: Possible Health Benefits of Yarrow Tea

Yarrow tea may have some health benefits, including reduced inflammation, improved digestive health, and wound healing.
Yarrow tea is brewed from a popular medicinal herb .
Yarrow (Achillea millefolium) has been used for thousands of years for its potential health benefits. Its genus name, Achillea, refers to the warrior Achilles in Greek mythology, as he used yarrow to treat his soldiers’ wounds.
There are 140 different species of Achillea, which are characterized by their clustered flowers and hairy, aromatic leaves.
Some research indicates this plant may have various benefits, including  helping with  inflammation, wound healing, and digestive health.

Wound healing
Since the times of Ancient Greece, yarrow has been used in poultices and ointments to treat wounds.
This  2019 research  noted that yarrow leaf extracts showed anti-inflammatory and  antioxidant  properties, which  might help  with wound healing.
Meanwhile, this  small 2017 study  also found that an ointment made from this herb and St. John’s wort helped heal episiotomy sites, which are surgical incisions on the vaginal wall made during childbirth.
More research in human resources in larger clinical studies would be needed to confirm these findings.
You can consult a healthcare professional about any wound healing concerns you may have, to find an appropriate treatment that might work best for you.

Digestive issues
Yarrow has long been used to  treat digestive issues  like ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), symptoms of which include stomach pain, diarrhea, bloating, and constipation.
This  research  found that the aerial parts of these plants (the parts above the soil) may contain a bitter digestive tonic, which might help support bile flow and work as a diuretic. The alkaloids in the plant’s levels may also have antioxidant and gastroprotective properties, to help with your overall digestive health.

Symptoms of depression and anxiety
The flavonoids and alkaloids in yarrow tea  may help reduce  symptoms of depression and anxiety.
In this  2016 literature review , researchers noted that their analysis of studies in the past decade suggested that alkaloids in yarrow tea could play a big role as a natural antidepressant. However, they also pointed out that most of the research involved animal studies and that any conclusive human research was limited.
“In conclusion, enough scientific evidence gathered in our review supported that the plant-based alkaloids can serve as leads for antidepressant drug discovery,” they concluded. “It is key to subject these alkaloids to further clinical studies for efficacy, potency, and safety to ensure their clinical status.”

Brain health
2017 research  suggests that yarrow may help with certain brain disorders, including  multiple sclerosis ,  Alzheimer’s ,  Parkinson’s , and inflammation of the brain and spinal cord caused by a viral infection.
A  2018 research review  also made similar findings, noting that the alkaloids present in yarrow may offer possible help for several neurodegenerative diseases, as well as possibly for stroke.
Importantly, that research is based on many earlier studies that are listed and not focused on humans. More clinical trials in people would be needed to validate any findings in order to confirm any possible health benefits that yarrow may have.
You can consult your doctor and healthcare team about any depressive symptoms or anxiety you may experience, and if you have any concerns about brain-related conditions that you might be at risk for.

Inflammation
While inflammation is a natural bodily response, chronic inflammation can lead to cell, tissue, and organ damage.
Research indicates  that yarrow has  anti-inflammatory effects. Some have used yarrow and yarrow tea to help with symptoms related to inflammation. This may also include  possibly  reducing skin and liver inflammation  and treating skin infections, aging skin, and  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease .
Following the COVID-19 pandemic, this  2023 research  also noted that the anti-inflammatory effects of yarrow could also help with the virus causing COVID-19.
Although these results show promise, human research is needed.

Insulin resistance
2020 research  notes that yarrow may impact how well the body uses insulin, including for those who live with obesity and insulin resistance.
While only a mouse study, this one examined 3 months of mice fed yarrow extract and found improved insulin responses.
It’s important to note that this animal study is preliminary and isn’t conclusive of how yarrow or yarrow tea extracts would help in human health.

The bottom line
Yarrow has been used medicinally since ancient times, including as an herbal tea.
Research shows that its plant compounds may benefit wound healing, digestive issues, brain conditions, and other possible medical concerns. But it’s important to note that human research on the health implications of yarrow is limited and conclusions are largely based on small or animal-focused studies.
You should always consult a healthcare professional before adding any supplements or natural, alternative treatments to your life for any medical concerns or overall health benefits.
