Title: 18 Snacks and Drinks for a Healthy Heart

Heart-healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, can significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Incorporating omega-3 fatty acids from fish and nuts also promotes overall heart health and well-being.
Your heart keeps you alive and well, and protecting its health should be a top priority. Fortunately, following a diet high in heart-healthy nutrients can drastically reduce heart disease risk and promote optimal cardiovascular functioning.
Here are 18 heart-healthy snacks and drinks.

1. Matcha tea
Matcha  is a type of green tea that contains high levels of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). EGCG is a polyphenol compound in green tea that has potent antioxidant and  anti-inflammatory  properties.
Consuming EGCG-rich matcha tea may help improve heart health. Studies show that EGCG helps prevent atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty substances on artery walls, and may help  reduce inflammation  and cellular damage.
This is why green tea intake has been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke in  many studies .

2. Sardines packed in olive oil
Snacking on  sardines  packed in olive oil gives your heart a mega dose of healthy fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Sardines are small, fatty fish that happen to be one of the richest sources of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fats you can eat.
The heart health benefits of omega-3 fats are well documented, and studies show that omega-3-rich dietary patterns may  reduce your risk of heart disease  and its risk factors, such as high triglyceride levels.
Olive oil  intake is also strongly linked to improved heart health. A  2022 meta-analysis  concluded that 20 grams of olive oil a day is beneficial for heart health.

3. Walnut and tart cherry trail mix
Nuts and seeds are known to be heart healthy.  Walnuts  in particular have been shown to improve blood vessel function and  reduce heart disease risk factors  like inflammation, high blood pressure, and elevated cholesterol levels.

Try mixing walnuts and tart cherries for a nutritious, portable snack.
