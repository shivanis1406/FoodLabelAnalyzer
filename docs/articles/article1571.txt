Title: 9 High-Fat Foods That Offer Great Health Benefits

Certain high fat foods, including dairy products, eggs, and plants like avocados, pack important nutrients that can benefit your health. Many contain protein, fiber, and key vitamins.
Although dietary fat was once avoided and considered a major contributor to heart disease, researchers have found that it can offer some benefits.
However, the  American Heart Association  recommends that saturated fat should be limited to less than 10% of total calorie intake. Though some  saturated fats  —  like those found in dairy  — may not have the same negative effect as saturated fats that are found in red meat.
Still, full-fat foods may offer benefits over their reduced-fat or fat-free counterparts. They are usually less processed and lower in sugar and carbs.
Here are 9 high-fat foods that are incredibly nutritious.

Avocados
Avocados  are unique in the world of fruits. Whereas most fruits primarily contain  carbs ,  avocados  are loaded with fats.
In fact,  avocados  are about 80% fat, by calories, making them even higher in fat than most animal foods.
Avocados are also among the best sources of potassium in the diet, providing 15% of the Daily Value (DV) per 5-ounce (150-gram) serving. In addition, they’re packed with antioxidant compounds.
Additionally,  one study  involving 45 men and women found that consuming one avocado daily for 5 weeks had favorable effects on participants’ cholesterol profiles.
They’re also a  great source of fiber , which offers numerous digestive, heart health, and weight management benefits.

Cheese
Cheese  is surprisingly nutritious, despite its iffy reputation.
It is a great  source of calcium , vitamin B12,  phosphorus , and  selenium  and contains many other nutrients.
It is also  rich in protein , with a  single ounce  (28 grams) of cheese containing 6 grams of protein, nearly as much as a glass of  milk .
Cheese, like other high-fat dairy products, also  doesn’t appear to  increase  heart disease risk  compared with reduced-fat dairy — as it was previously thought to.

Dark chocolate
Dark chocolate  is a nutritious food disguised as a  tasty treat . It is very high in fat, with fat accounting for around 65% of calories.
It’s important to choose  dark chocolate  with at least 70% cocoa, as other varieties are higher in  added sugar  and lower in the nutrients and antioxidants that dark chocolate provides.
In addition, dark chocolate contains fiber and several notable nutrients, including  iron  and magnesium, which some people may have difficulty getting enough of.
It is also loaded with  antioxidants  like  resveratrol , the same antioxidant that gives  red wine  its health benefits, and  epicatechin , which may possess anti-aging and performance-enhancing properties.

Whole eggs
Whole  eggs  used to be considered unhealthy because the  yolks  are  high in cholesterol  and fat.
However,  new studies  have shown that  cholesterol in eggs  does not negatively affect the cholesterol in the blood, at least not in the majority of people.
In addition, eggs are  nutrient-dense , containing a variety of vitamins and minerals. One example is  choline , a nutrient that is essential for brain and nerve health. One egg ( 50 grams ) provides 27% of the DV of  choline .
Eggs are also a  weight-loss–friendly food . They are high in protein, which can help you to stay fuller between meals and cut down on excess calories.
Yolks and all, eggs can be a healthy addition to any diet.

Fatty fish
Fatty fish is widely regarded as one of the  most nutritious  animal protein sources available. This includes fish like  salmon , trout, anchovies, mackerel,  sardines , and herring.
These fish are loaded with heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids,  high quality proteins , and a variety of vitamins and minerals.
Research shows that regular fatty fish consumption may  enhance cognitive function , help regulate  blood sugar levels , and decrease  heart disease risk .
If you can’t (or don’t) eat fish, taking a  fish oil supplement  may be useful. Cod fish liver oil is best. It contains  all the omega-3s  that you need, as well as plenty of  vitamin D .

Nuts
Nuts  are incredibly healthy. They are  high in healthy fats  and  fiber  and are a good plant-based source of protein.
Nuts also contain vitamin E and are  loaded with magnesium , a mineral that most people don’t get enough of.
Studies show  that people who eat nuts tend to have a lower rate of obesity and  a lower risk  of heart disease.
Healthy nuts include  almonds , walnuts, macadamia nuts, and numerous others.

Chia seeds
Chia seeds  are generally not thought of as a “fatty” food, but an ounce (28 grams) of  chia seeds  actually contains 11 grams of fat.
Additionally, almost all the carbs in chia seeds are fiber — so the vast majority of calories in them actually come from fat.
These aren’t just any fats either. The majority of the fats in chia seeds consist of the heart-healthy, essential omega-3 fatty acid called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).
Chia seeds may also have numerous health benefits, such as  lowering blood pressure  and having anti-inflammatory effects.
They are also incredibly  nutritious . In addition to being loaded with fiber and omega-3s, chia seeds are also packed with nutrients.

Extra virgin olive oil
Another fatty food that almost everyone agrees is healthy is  extra virgin olive oil . It’s high in  oleic acid , a fatty acid with powerful anti-inflammatory properties.
This fat is an essential component of the  Mediterranean diet , which has been shown to have numerous  health benefits  regarding heart health,  blood sugar management , and weight management.
It’s extremely versatile in cooking but really shines on roasted vegetables and in homemade salad dressings.

Full-fat yogurt
Full-fat  yogurt  can be nutrient rich. It has all the same important nutrients as other high-fat dairy products.
However, it’s also loaded with healthy  probiotics  that can have powerful effects on your health.
Studies show that yogurt may improve  digestive health  and may even help with  weight management  and  reducing heart disease risk .
Additionally,  research suggests  that full-fat dairy has no negative health effects compared with fat-free or reduced-fat dairy.
It’s important to choose full-fat or whole-milk yogurt and select a version with minimal added sugar.

The bottom line
Although high-fat foods were once thought to be low in nutrients, research now shows that some fats do not pose the negative concerns for heart health that it once thought to.
Additionally, naturally, high-fat foods may offer similar health benefits to their low fat counterparts while being less processed.
Although they are higher in calories, the high fat foods on this list can easily be part of a nutrient-dense, whole–food–based diet.
