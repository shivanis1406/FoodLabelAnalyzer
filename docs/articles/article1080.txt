Title: Can Gluten Cause Anxiety?

The term gluten refers to a group of proteins found in a variety of cereal grains, including wheat, rye, and barley.
While most people are able to tolerate gluten, it can trigger a number of adverse side effects in those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.
In addition to causing digestive distress, headaches, and skin problems, some report that gluten may contribute to psychological symptoms like anxiety ( 1 ).
This article takes a closer look at the research to determine whether gluten can cause anxiety.

Celiac disease
For those with  celiac disease , eating gluten triggers inflammation in the intestines, causing symptoms like bloating, gas, diarrhea, and fatigue ( 2 ).
Some studies show that celiac disease may also be associated with a higher risk of certain psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, depression,  bipolar disorder , and schizophrenia ( 3 ).
Following a gluten-free diet can not only help alleviate symptoms for those with celiac disease but also reduce anxiety.
In fact, one 2001 study found that following a gluten-free diet for 1 year decreased anxiety in 35 people with celiac disease ( 4 ).
Another small study in 20 people with celiac disease reported that participants had higher levels of anxiety prior to starting a gluten-free diet than after adhering to it for 1 year ( 5 ).
However, other studies have observed conflicting findings.
For instance, one study found that women with celiac disease were more likely to have anxiety, compared with the general population, even after complying with a gluten-free diet ( 6 ).
Notably, living with family was also associated with a higher risk of anxiety disorders in the study, which may be attributed to the stress caused by buying and preparing meals for family members with and without celiac disease ( 6 ).
What’s more, a 2020 study in 283 people with celiac disease reported a high incidence of anxiety in those with celiac disease and found that adherence to a gluten-free diet did not significantly improve anxiety symptoms.
Therefore, while following a gluten-free diet could decrease anxiety for some with celiac disease, it may make no difference in anxiety levels or even contribute to stress and anxiety in others.
More research is needed to evaluate the effects of a gluten-free diet on anxiety for those with celiac disease.
Celiac disease is associated with a higher risk of anxiety disorders. While research has found mixed results, some studies show that following a gluten-free diet can decrease anxiety in those with celiac disease.

Gluten sensitivity
Those with non-celiac  gluten sensitivity  may also experience adverse side effects when gluten is consumed, including symptoms like fatigue, headaches, and muscle pain ( 7 ).
In some cases, those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity may also experience psychological symptoms, such as depression or anxiety ( 7 ).
While more high quality studies are needed, some research suggests that eliminating gluten from the diet may be beneficial for these conditions.
According to one study in 23 people, 13% of participants reported that following a gluten-free diet led to reductions in subjective feelings of anxiety ( 8 ).
Another study in 22 people with non-celiac gluten sensitivity found that consuming gluten for 3 days led to increased feelings of  depression , compared with a control group ( 9 ).
Though the cause of these symptoms remains unclear, some research suggests that the effect could be due to alterations in the gut microbiome, a community of beneficial bacteria in your digestive tract that’s involved in several aspects of health ( 10 ,  11 ).
Unlike celiac disease or  wheat allergy , there’s no specific test used to diagnose gluten sensitivity.
However, if you experience anxiety, depression, or any other negative symptoms after consuming gluten, consult a healthcare professional to determine whether a gluten-free diet may be right for you.
Following a gluten-free diet may decrease subjective feelings of anxiety and depression in those who are sensitive to gluten.

The bottom line
Anxiety  is often associated with celiac disease and gluten sensitivity.
Though research has observed mixed results, several studies show that following a gluten-free diet may help reduce symptoms of anxiety in those with celiac disease or a sensitivity to gluten.
If you find that gluten causes anxiety or other adverse symptoms for you, consider consulting a healthcare provider to determine whether a gluten-free diet may be beneficial.
