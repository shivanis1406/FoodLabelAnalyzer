When it comes to exercising at home, there’s no shortage of cardio workout equipment to choose from.
Elliptical machines  are a popular choice because ellipticals can be easier on your joints than treadmills but still offer a challenging workout.
However, because elliptical machines vary significantly in size, features, and price, it can be a challenge to find the best elliptical for your needs. Here’s our roundup of the 7 best ellipticals available.
General price ranges with dollar signs ($ to $$$) are indicated below. One dollar sign means the product is rather affordable, whereas three dollar signs indicate a higher cost.
Generally, list prices range from $129 to $3,299, but your actual price will depend on available discounts and where you shop.
Pricing guide
$  = under $750
$$  = $750 to $2,000
$$$  = over $2,000

If you’re willing to splurge, the NordicTrack FreeStride Trainer is one of the best ellipticals overall, as this elliptical is packed with special features.
This elliptical machine boasts a whopping 26 levels of resistance, features −10% decline to 10% incline control, and even auto-adjusts to your stride length for a truly customized experience. Out of our picks for the best ellipticals, this NordicTrack elliptical machine has the highest weight capacity — 375 pounds (lb) or 170 kilograms (kg).
What’s more, its  treadmill  and stair-climbing settings mean you’re essentially getting three machines in one.
Other notable features include:
a cooling fan
soft-grip handles
oversized cushion pedals
a 14-inch (in), or 35.5-centimeter (cm), touch screen
Bluetooth speakers
As a bonus, this elliptical comes with a 30-day membership to iFit, a subscription service with thousands of on-demand workout options.
The membership also includes an option to have your incline and resistance levels adjusted by a personal trainer during your workout.
After your free trial, you can renew your subscription for $180 or $396 per year, depending on whether you choose an individual or family plan.
While this elliptical is one of the most expensive options, it comes with extensive warranties, including 10 years on the frame and 2 years on parts.

Easiest on the knees
Item dimensions   55.25 x 38 x 52.5 in (140.3 x 96.5 x 133.4 cm)
Price   $$

Teeter’s FreeStep Recumbent Cross Trainer and Elliptical is designed especially for a workout that’s easy on the knees and back.

Like a  recumbent exercise bike , this elliptical machine offers back support to reduce discomfort. Plus, the seat has a larger surface area and is thicker than that of most other ellipticals.

This elliptical machine uses magnetic resistance. This means that it’s less noisy than most ellipticals. The digital display tracks:
time
distance
speed
calorie burn


The media rack allows you to use your phone or tablet while working out.

An added bonus is that you can access instructor-led classes via the free Teeter Move app. Most of the elliptical machines on this list are compatible with costly workout apps, which can be expensive over time. The Teeter Move app, however, is free. Additionally, shipping is free if you order from the Teeter website.

Looking to take your elliptical workout outside? The ElliptiGO 3C Outdoor Stand-Up Bike is a fun and unique way to work up a sweat.
Unlike a classic elliptical machine, the ElliptiGO doesn’t have a seat. Instead, you propel the bike forward by standing and moving the pedals in a gliding motion.
Just keep in mind that this elliptical is meant for outdoor use and can be bulky to store. If you do want to ride indoors, ElliptiGO offers an accessory called the Fluid 365 Stationary Trainer for $599 that will hold the elliptical machine in place.

Looking for the best elliptical you can tuck away when you’re not working out? The Air Walk Trainer can fold up to half its length for easy storage between workouts.
While this elliptical doesn’t offer incline or resistance levels, it does have a 30-in (76.2-cm) stride capacity that stands out from the other best ellipticals on our list.
This elliptical also has an adjustable abdominal cushion so people of different heights can feel comfortable working out on the same elliptical machine. That said, the max weight capacity is 220 lbs, which may not suit all users.
While this elliptical trainer is probably not the best choice for serious athletes, the low price and easy assembly (users rave about how easy it is to put together) make this one of the best budget ellipticals for a tight space.

What if you could take your elliptical machine to work with you? The Cubii is small enough to fit:
under desks
next to couches
in your car on road trips
This elliptical is meant for use while sitting, which also makes it a good option for doing  physical therapy  or  exercising with an upper body injury .
Although it lacks handlebars, this elliptical offers eight resistance levels and has an LCD screen to help you track calories burned and distance traveled.
It won’t engage your upper body like some elliptical machines do, which means it’s not the best elliptical for a back-and-shoulder workout. But since you can use this elliptical while you’re sitting at work, you might find that you use it more throughout the day.
The Cubii uses magnetic resistance, which means a muted workout, so you won’t have to worry about disturbing your co-workers.
If you enjoy the convenience of working out on your own but miss the community feel of a group class, you can subscribe to Cubii Studio+ to access over 300 free on-demand workout classes.

If you want a full-body workout, the BowFlex Max Trainer M9 is a great elliptical machine. This elliptical is similar to the M6 but includes an HD touch screen you can use to access streaming services and the JRNY app for guided workouts.
With 20 resistance levels, you can adjust this elliptical to suit your specific needs and fitness level. What’s more, it integrates with smart devices and heart rate monitors and includes a heart rate armband so you can make sure that you’re getting the most out of your workout.
While a 1-year JRNY membership is included with your purchase, you’ll need to renew your membership after a year to continue to get the most out of the equipment. It typically costs $19.99 per month or $149 per year plus taxes.

How we chose our best ellipticals
We researched the best ellipticals on the market and evaluated them based on the following criteria:
Workout modes and resistance levels:  For the best elliptical workout possible, we looked for elliptical machines with customized workout options.
Special features:  We know it’s the little things that really set an elliptical machine apart, so we factored in features like cupholders, fans, touch screens, and instructor-led classes.
Price:  Because budgets can vary, we included elliptical machines at a variety of price points, from high end machines to budget ellipticals under $750.
Warranties:  The best ellipticals aren’t cheap, which is why we researched the warranty policy for each product.
Customer reviews:  Some things you just can’t know until you try a product. We’ve combed customer reviews to find the top-rated elliptical machines according to those who’ve used them first-hand.
Our list is not in rank order because we recognize that the best elliptical machine for you will depend on your specific needs and desires. To help you with this, we’ve tried to select the best options for a variety of features.
Note that the prices above reflect the current market list price and may vary by retailer.

Tips for choosing your own elliptical
Ready to buy an elliptical? Here are some factors to consider:
Space:  How much room do you have for an elliptical machine? Do you have space for additional equipment, or do you need a multipurpose machine?
Your exercise needs and desired features:  How many resistance and incline levels do you want? Are you fine working out on your own, or do you prefer instructor-led classes?
Warranties:  The best ellipticals are pricey investments, so you’ll want to check what’s covered under the warranty and for how long.
Customer reviews:  Especially if you’re ordering online and can’t try it out for yourself, look for an elliptical machine that’s rated highly by consumers.

Frequently asked questions
If you use a home elliptical frequently enough, it’s worth the investment. For many people, buying an elliptical machine for home use is worth it, since it can be easier to get a quick workout at home than it is to go to the gym.
Consider creating a  regular exercise routine  to ensure you get your money’s worth.
If you’re not sure whether you’ll enjoy using an elliptical, consider trying one out in a gym or at a sports equipment store before making a purchase. If you prefer to use a variety of gym equipment, a gym membership might be more worthwhile.

Personal preference plays a large role in choosing between the two elliptical styles.
Front-drive ellipticals tend to be cheaper and  more compact , but having the flywheel in the front can also limit stride length a bit. This can affect taller people whose legs need extra stride room.
Rear-drive ellipticals tend to flatten exercise movements and have a more natural feel. They also tend to be quieter and have fewer moving parts, which can mean less maintenance. These ellipticals may not offer the same range of incline options as a front-drive elliptical, though.

Elliptical machines can offer a full-body aerobic workout. An elliptical workout can strengthen your:
glutes
hamstrings
quads
chest
back
biceps
triceps
core muscles
Have a specific area you’d like to focus on? By changing the incline and resistance, you can focus on specific lower body muscle groups such as your quads or calves. Moving the pedals in reverse  allows you  to focus on your hamstrings and glutes.
If you stand up straight and release the handlebars, you can even work on  core strength  and balance.

When used appropriately, ellipticals can be a safe way to get a low impact workout. In fact, using an elliptical can put less stress on your knees, hips, and back than running or using a treadmill.
Before beginning any new exercise routine, it’s important to check with a healthcare professional. They can advise you on any specific personal health concerns that would make working out on an elliptical unsafe.

Both walking and using the elliptical are  cardiovascular exercises , and they both burn calories. While walking is a free and relatively accessible workout, elliptical workouts offer some distinct advantages over a long stroll.
If you’re looking for a  low impact workout  to reduce strain on your joints, using an elliptical may be better than walking.
A  2022 study  showed that an elliptical workout is less weight-bearing than walking and other cardio exercises.
A  study from 2020  found that elliptical workouts put less pressure on the plantar fascia than walking, which may make ellipticals better for people who tend to get  plantar fasciitis .
To reap all the  benefits of elliptical exercise , it’s a good idea to speak with a physiotherapist or personal trainer. This is an especially good idea if you have an injury or specific health concern.

A treadmill has some benefits over an elliptical: It can be more effective for burning calories and improving strength. However, the elliptical is easier on your joints, especially your knee joints, offering lower impact workouts.
If you’re looking to get something specific out of your workouts, it might be best to discuss it with a physiotherapist or personal trainer, as they can give you personalized advice on which machines to use.

No specific workout can help you  lose belly fat  faster than another. However, if you want to burn calories, elliptical machines can offer a high intensity workout without affecting your joints as much as, say, a treadmill.
Working out on an elliptical machine can improve your core muscles, which won’t necessarily help you lose belly fat but can help you strengthen your abdominal muscles.

physical space
