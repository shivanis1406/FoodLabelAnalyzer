Title: What Is Ballerina Tea? Weight Loss, Benefits, and Downsides


Ballerina tea, also known as 3 Ballerina tea, is an infusion that has recently gained popularity due to its association with weight loss and other health benefits.
Its name originates from the idea that it helps you achieve a slim and agile figure, much like that of a ballerina.
However, research only supports some of its health claims.
This article explains everything you need to know about Ballerina tea, including its health benefits and downsides.

What is Ballerina tea?
Though some blends of Ballerina tea include a variety of ingredients to improve flavor, such as  cinnamon  or lemon, its main components are two herbs — senna ( Senna alexandrina  or  Cassia angustifolia ) and Chinese mallow ( Malva verticillata ).
Both have traditionally been used for their laxative effects, which are exerted via two mechanisms ( 1 ):
Speeding digestion.  This is achieved by promoting contractions that help move the contents of your intestine onward.
Creating an osmotic effect.  When electrolytes are released into your colon and increase the flow of water, your stools become softer.
The active elements in senna and Chinese mallow are water-soluble, which is why users consume them in the form of tea.
Ballerina tea is marketed as a way to promote  fast weight loss .
Its ingredients have laxative effects and cause your body to excrete a lot of fluid, ridding it of water weight. Some people drink Ballerina tea for this particular purpose.
However, senna and Chinese mallow don’t act upon the metabolism of fats. Thus, the lost weight consists mainly of water and is quickly regained once you rehydrate.
The main ingredients in Ballerina tea are senna and Chinese mallow. Both have laxative effects, which translates into lost weight in the form of water — not fat.

Rich in antioxidants
Antioxidants  are substances that help prevent or reduce cell damage.
Flavonoids are a type of antioxidant commonly found in plants that helps protect against cellular damage and may reduce disease risk ( 2 ).
For example, a review of 22 studies that included 575,174 people observed that a higher intake of flavonoids significantly reduced the risk of death from heart disease ( 3 ).
Ballerina tea contains high amounts of flavonoids — both from senna and Chinese mallow — which may provide antioxidant protection ( 4 ,  5 ,  6 ).
Due to the flavonoids in its two main ingredients, Ballerina tea offers antioxidant properties.

May help fight constipation
The laxative properties of Ballerina tea, which are mainly due to its senna content, make it a natural and affordable remedy for  constipation .
Chronic constipation impairs quality of life and can cause complications in severe cases. Therefore, treatment is essential.
In a 4-week study in 40 people with chronic constipation, those taking a laxative containing senna every other day experienced a 37.5% increase in defecation frequency, as well as fewer defecation difficulties, compared with the placebo group ( 7 ).
However, research also shows that long-term use of senna as a laxative may cause side effects, such as diarrhea and  electrolyte imbalances  ( 8 ).
Also, Ballerina tea contains less senna than concentrated supplements, so it’s unclear whether the tea would have the same effect on constipation.
Though studies have confirmed that the ingredients in Ballerina tea ease constipation, it’s unclear whether the tea is as effective as concentrated supplements containing these same ingredients.

Caffeine-free alternative to coffee and other types of tea
Some people can’t start the day without their caffeine fix, while others may try to avoid it for personal or health reasons.
For less-tolerant consumers, caffeine intake may cause insomnia, sensory disturbances, restlessness, irregular heartbeat, and other  adverse effects  ( 9 ).
Unlike many other teas — especially weight loss teas — Ballerina tea is caffeine-free.
Yet, consumers still report that Ballerina tea provides an  energy boost , which they attribute to the loss of water weight it causes. However, no evidence seems to support this claim.
Ballerina tea is caffeine-free, which is an advantage for those who want or have to avoid this substance.

May lower blood sugar levels
Ballerina tea may  reduce blood sugar levels  due to its Chinese mallow content.
In a 4-week study in mice with type 2 diabetes, those given Chinese mallow extract experienced 17% and 23% reductions in non-fasting and fasting blood sugar levels, respectively ( 10 ).
These effects were attributed to plant and herbal extracts activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which plays a central role in blood sugar control ( 10 ,  11 ).
What’s more, test-tube and animal studies indicate that the antioxidant properties of the flavonoids in Chinese mallow may also have antidiabetic potential by promoting insulin secretion ( 12 ,  13 ).
Still, research on Ballerina tea specifically is lacking, so it’s unclear whether this beverage aids blood sugar control.
Though evidence suggests that Chinese mallow extracts may aid blood sugar control, it’s unclear whether Chinese-mallow-containing Ballerina tea offers the same effect.

Concerns and side effects
Drinking Ballerina tea may cause unwanted side effects, such as abdominal cramps, dehydration, and mild to severe diarrhea ( 14 ).
Moreover, one study determined that prolonged use of senna products caused diarrhea in rats and increased toxicity in kidney and liver tissues. Therefore, scientists advised that people with kidney and liver diseases should not use these products ( 15 ).
Research also shows that the laxative effects of the senna in Ballerina tea are dose-dependent. In terms of safety, the correct dose would be the lowest amount required to produce the desired results ( 1 ).
Though you may experience weight loss when drinking Ballerina tea, this is likely attributed to  water loss  — not fat loss.
If you’re trying to lose weight, developing healthier eating habits and  increasing your activity levels  are much safer, evidence-based ways to promote  sustainable weight loss .
Ballerina tea is likely safe in moderation. Still, high doses may cause abdominal cramps, dehydration, diarrhea, and other adverse effects. Plus, it’s not an effective way to lose excess body fat.

The bottom line
The primary ingredients in Ballerina tea are senna and Chinese mallow.
This caffeine-free tea is rich in antioxidants and may ease constipation and lower blood sugar levels.
However, it’s not a good option for weight loss, as its  laxative effects  translate into lost weight in the form of water and stools — not fat.
If you want to try Ballerina tea, you can find it  online , but be sure to consult your healthcare provider first to avoid any potentially harmful side effects.
