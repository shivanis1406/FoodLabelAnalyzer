Title: Can Probiotics Help Manage the Symptoms of Menopause?

Probiotics may help ease menopausal symptoms and regulate body weight, but their effectiveness remains controversial.
Menopause can be a challenging time for some people. Many people experience hot flashes, night sweats, and other symptoms alongside physical changes such as weight gain.
The symptoms that occur during this transition period can vary from person to person. Some people may not have symptoms, some may have mild symptoms, and some may have severe symptoms.
Symptoms of menopause can last for a few years, and you may feel like you’ve reached the end of menopause when they subside. However, entering the postmenopausal stage can bring additional health risks such as osteoporosis and heart disease.
Some research suggests that probiotics can help relieve these symptoms or reduce their severity. Here’s what you should know.

Hot flashes and night sweats
The  hypothalamus  in your brain regulates your hormonal system and body temperature.
The reduction in estrogen production during menopause may influence your hypothalamus to work differently, leading to vasomotor symptoms.
Vasomotor symptoms occur when your blood vessels abruptly change in size, resulting in a warmer body temperature. The effects of this are commonly known as  hot flashes  and  night sweats .
A small  2017 study  involving 62 women suggests that consuming probiotics alongside supplements such as red clover may help reduce vasomotor symptoms.
Red clover  is a type of legume that contains isoflavone, a substance that acts similarly to  estrogen .
While red clover is marketed as an extract to reduce menopausal symptoms, its effectiveness in treating them  remains unclear .

Sleep quality and mood improvement
It’s  thought  that your gut and your brain communicate with each other through your  nervous ,  immune , and  endocrine  systems. The types of  beneficial bacteria  present in your gut may even affect your mood.
Mood changes, hot flashes, and night sweats are all symptoms of menopause that can interfere  with your sleep .
A  2020 review of studies  found a correlation between probiotic bacteria and sleep quality and mood improvement in people who experienced  anxiety  and  depression .

Vaginal infections
The  vagina  acts as a barrier to prevent harmful bacteria from causing infection.
Before menopause, estrogen promotes the colonization of  Lactobacilli , a type of beneficial bacteria in the vagina.  Lactobacilli  help maintain a lower  vaginal pH level  to  reduce  the risk of  vaginal infections .
The lack of estrogen production during the menopausal and postmenopausal periods can increase your vaginal pH level, allowing the growth of harmful bacteria such as  Enterobacter ,  Escherichia coli ,  Candida , and  Gardnerella .
These bacteria may  increase  your risk for vaginal infections.
It’s thought that using probiotics alone or in combination with antimicrobial medications may help prevent vaginal infections and symptoms related to them, such as  vaginal discharge changes  and  unusual odor .

Osteoporosis
Estrogen plays a vital role in maintaining bone strength, and a decline in estrogen production can increase your risk of developing  osteoporosis .
Your age, sex assigned at birth, race, ethnicity, and overall health also play a role.
Globally,  1 in 3  women over 50 are at risk of osteoporosis-induced  fractures .
Limiting or stopping use of tobacco products and taking calcium and vitamin D supplements may help slow down bone loss.
A  2021 review of studies  found that incorporating probiotics may help increase  bone mineral density  at the lumbar spine in postmenopausal people.

Weight gain and weight loss
Weight gain is  common  among those who experience  perimenopause and menopause  because of the progressive decline in estrogen production and  ovarian function .
During this time, it’s typical to experience a loss of lean body mass and a  redistribution of body fat , with more fat accumulating in your abdomen.
Having more fat in your waist area can  increase  your risk of  insulin resistance  and  dyslipidemia .
A lack of exercise and a diet high in fat, salt, and sugar can  also contribute  to weight gain, fat accumulation in the abdomen, and the risk of  cardiovascular and metabolic diseases .
Additionally, menopause-induced  stress  may trigger  emotional eating , which could contribute to weight gain.
Research suggests that the bacterial  composition in the colon  could contribute to metabolic diseases. People with overweight or obesity  may be more prone  to inflammation, insulin resistance, and fat accumulation.
Certain strains of probiotics are thought to  improve  the health of the gut lining by reducing inflammation and reducing the risk of obesity and other chronic conditions.
Specifically, probiotics  may promote  weight loss by increasing short-chain fatty acids, increasing the number of beneficial bacteria, reducing inflammation and fat deposition, and improving  insulin sensitivity .
A 2017  review of studies  suggests that short-term probiotic supplementation — lasting less than 12 weeks — may contribute to slight reductions in body weight,  body mass index , and body fat percentage.
However,  most research  on probiotics and weight loss has involved small groups of participants and looked only at participants  who had  overweight or obesity.
More research is needed to better understand the potential role of  probiotics in weight loss .

Probiotic side effects to consider
You can consume probiotics by eating  fermented  foods such as yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, and kombucha, or you can take probiotic supplements.
Foods with naturally occurring probiotics  are generally well tolerated when consumed in moderation.
Although probiotic supplements may be somewhat more likely to cause side effects, the effects are usually mild and tend to resolve within a few days to weeks.
Starting slowly with a low dose and gradually increasing your dose over time may help reduce your risk of side effects.
Temporary side effects may include:
gas
bloating
constipation
increased thirst
headache
If your symptoms persist or worsen over time, stop using probiotics and consult a healthcare professional.

Probiotic product recommendations
Consuming probiotics may help reduce menopause symptoms by balancing your body’s unique microbiome of harmful and healthful bacteria.
Bifidobacterium animalis  is a  type of bacteria  naturally found in your colon. Supplementing your diet with this type of bacteria  may reduce  abdominal fat, which is one of the key factors associated with metabolic disorders.
Lactobacillus gasseri  is a type of bacteria naturally found in the vagina.  Studies  involving rodents showed effects on weight loss with the use of  Lactobacillus gasseri .
Synbiotics , a mixture of prebiotics and probiotics,  may also support  weight loss and anti-inflammatory functions.
Learn more about the best probiotic supplements recommended by dietitians.
If you choose foods with probiotics, such as  yogurt  and  kefir , be sure to look for those that include live bacteria by reading the food packaging.
Under  current  Food and Drug Administration food labeling regulations, it’s optional for yogurt producers to list the amount and state of the bacteria present in their product. However, this regulation is changing as of  January 1, 2024 .

The bottom line
Probiotics may help ease menopause symptoms and regulate body weight, but their effectiveness remains controversial.
More research is needed to explore and support the health benefits associated with probiotic use during the various stages of menopause.
For example, consuming probiotics alone will not lead to weight loss during perimenopause, menopause, or postmenopause.
