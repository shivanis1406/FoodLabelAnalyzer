Title: What Is Extra Virgin Olive Oil, and Why Is It Healthy?

Extra virgin olive oil is a great source of antioxidant compounds, like vitamin E, oleacein, and oleocanthal. It may help prevent heart disease, promote brain function, and protect against certain types of cancer.
Known for its rich flavor, versatility, and health benefits, extra virgin olive oil is an excellent ingredient to keep in your kitchen cupboard.
Not only is it easy to use for roasting, frying, baking, or sautéing, but it’s also jam-packed with antioxidants and heart-healthy fats.
Plus, it’s been studied extensively for its many health benefits, with some research suggesting that it could protect against heart disease, combat cancer, and alleviate inflammation.
This article takes a closer look at the potential benefits, downsides, and uses of extra virgin olive oil, along with how it stacks up against other common cooking oils.

What is olive oil and how is it made?
Olive oil is a type of oil that has been extracted from  olives , the fruits of the olive tree.
The production process is simple. Olives can be pressed to extract their oil, but modern methods involve crushing the olives, mixing them, and then separating the oil from the pulp in a centrifuge ( 1 ).
After centrifugation, small amounts of oil remain. The leftover oil can be extracted using chemical solvents and is known as olive pomace oil ( 2 ).
There are several grades of olive oil, which vary in terms of their nutritional content and the amount of processing that they undergo.
The three main grades of olive oil include:
refined olive oil
virgin olive oil
extra virgin olive oil
Extra virgin olive oil is the  least processed  variety and is often considered to be the healthiest type of olive oil. It’s extracted using natural methods and standardized for purity and certain sensory qualities, such as taste and smell ( 3 ).
In addition to its unique flavor and aroma, extra virgin olive oil is rich in disease-fighting antioxidants and has been associated with a wide range of potential health benefits ( 4 ).
Modern olive oil is made by crushing olives and separating the oil from the pulp in a centrifuge. Extra virgin olive oil is the least processed variety and is rich in antioxidants.

Nutrient composition of extra virgin olive oil
Extra virgin olive oil is rich in heart-healthy fats, along with vitamins E and K.
A tablespoon (about 14 grams) of olive oil contains the following nutrients ( 5 ):
Calories:  119
Saturated fat:  14% of total calories
Monounsaturated fat:  73% of total calories (mostly oleic acid)
Polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) : 11% of total calories
Vitamin E:  13% of the Daily Value (DV)
Vitamin K:  7% of the DV
Extra virgin olive oil is a  great source of antioxidants , which are compounds that help fight inflammation and chronic disease ( 6 ,  7 ).
The oil’s main antioxidants include the anti-inflammatory oleocanthal, as well as oleuropein, a substance that protects LDL (bad) cholesterol from oxidation ( 8 ).
Some people have criticized olive oil for having a high  omega-6 to omega-3 ratio . However, its total amount of polyunsaturated fats is still relatively low, so you probably don’t need to worry ( 5 ).
In addition to its impressive antioxidant content, extra virgin olive oil is loaded with monounsaturated fatty acids, a type of healthy fat that has been linked to several benefits.
In particular, research suggests that monounsaturated fatty acids could benefit heart health and may even help  protect against heart disease  ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ).
Extra virgin olive oil also contains a good amount of vitamins E and K in each serving.  Vitamin E  is an essential nutrient that doubles as an antioxidant, while vitamin K plays a key role in bone health, blood clotting, heart health, and more ( 12 ,  13 ).
Olive oil is very high in monounsaturated fats and contains a modest amount of vitamins E and K. Extra virgin olive oil is also loaded with antioxidants, some of which have powerful health benefits.

Extra virgin olive oil contains anti-inflammatory substances
Chronic inflammation is believed to be among the leading drivers of many diseases, including heart disease, cancer, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and arthritis.
Some speculate that olive oil’s ability to  fight inflammation  is behind many of its health benefits.
Oleic acid, the most prominent fatty acid in olive oil, has been shown to reduce inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP) ( 14 ).
However, the oil’s main anti-inflammatory effects seem to stem from its content of antioxidants like oleacein and oleocanthal, which appear to significantly reduce inflammation in test-tube and animal studies ( 15 ,  16 ).
Interestingly, several studies have found that regular consumption of olive oil may be linked to lower levels of certain markers of inflammation, including CRP and interleukin-6 ( 17 ,  18 ).
However, keep in mind that chronic, low-level inflammation is usually mild, and it takes years or decades for it to do damage. More human studies are needed before we can draw conclusions about olive oil’s ability to counter it.
Still, making extra virgin olive oil a regular part of your diet could help protect against damage in the long run, leading to a reduced risk of various inflammatory diseases, including heart disease.
Olive oil contains oleic acid and antioxidants, which can help fight inflammation. This may be the main reason for olive oil’s health benefits.

Extra virgin olive oil and heart disease
Cardiovascular diseases, such as heart disease and stroke, are among the most common causes of death in the world ( 19 ).
But many observational studies show that death from these diseases is low in certain areas of the world, especially in Mediterranean countries, where olive oil is a major part of people’s diets ( 20 ).
This observation spurred interest in  the Mediterranean diet , which is supposed to mimic the way the people in that region eat. ( 21 ).
Studies on the Mediterranean diet consistently show that it’s associated with improved heart health and may help prevent heart disease and stroke ( 22 ).
Extra virgin olive oil protects against heart disease via numerous mechanisms:
Reduces inflammation.  Olive oil can decrease inflammation, a key driver of heart disease ( 23 ,  24 ).
Reduces oxidation of LDL (bad) cholesterol.  Olive oil may prevent LDL particles from oxidative damage, an important factor in the development of heart disease ( 25 ).
Improves blood vessel health.  Olive oil may improve the function of the endothelium, which is the lining of the blood vessels ( 18 ,  26 ).
Helps manage blood clotting.  Some studies suggest that olive oil can help prevent unwanted blood clotting, which could contribute to heart attack and stroke ( 27 ).
Lowers blood pressure.  Research suggests that increased intake of olive oil could be tied to  lower blood pressure , which may aid in the prevention of heart disease ( 28 ,  29 ).
Given the multitude of health-promoting properties associated with olive oil, it’s not surprising that many studies show that increased consumption may even be linked to a lower risk of heart disease and stroke ( 30 ,  31 ,  32 ).
Olive oil can improve several aspects of heart health. In fact, studies show that it may reduce blood pressure and inflammation, protect LDL particles from oxidation, improve blood vessel health, and help prevent unwanted blood clotting.

Other health benefits of extra virgin olive oil
Although olive oil has mostly been studied for its effects on heart health, its consumption has been associated with a number of other health benefits as well.
Studies have shown that people living in Mediterranean countries have a fairly low risk of cancer, which may be partly due to their consumption of anti-inflammatory ingredients, including olive oil ( 33 ).
One potential contributor to cancer is oxidative damage due to harmful molecules called free radicals. However, extra virgin olive oil is  high in antioxidants  that reduce oxidative damage ( 6 ).
Oleic acid, in particular, is also highly resistant to oxidation and has been shown to slow the growth and spread of cancer cells in some test-tube studies ( 34 ,  35 ).
According to a 2011 review, regular consumption of olive oil may also be associated with a lower risk of developing breast cancer or cancer of the digestive system ( 36 ).
Still, more recent, high quality research is needed to understand the effects of olive oil on cancer when enjoyed as part of a healthy, well-rounded diet.
Alzheimer’s disease is the world’s most common neurodegenerative disease and a leading cause of dementia ( 37 ).
One feature of Alzheimer’s disease is a buildup of proteins known as beta-amyloid plaques in certain neurons in the brain ( 38 ).
Animal studies have found that extra virgin olive oil and some of the compounds it contains could  help preserve brain function  by preventing the buildup of these proteins ( 39 ,  40 ).
Additionally, some studies show that following the Mediterranean diet, which is typically rich in olive oil, may also be associated with a reduced the risk of dementia and cognitive impairment ( 41 ,  42 ).
Preliminary evidence suggests that olive oil can help fight cancer and Alzheimer’s disease, although more human studies need to confirm this.

Extra virgin olive oil vs. other oils
In addition to extra virgin olive oil, there are many other popular cooking oils available, including regular olive oil, canola oil, vegetable oil,  avocado oil , and coconut oil.
Here is a closer look at how extra virgin olive oil compares to these other types of oils ( 5 ,  43 ,  44 ,  45 ,  46 ,  47 ,  48 ):
There are several different types of cooking oils available, each of which varies in terms of taste, nutritional value, uses, and smoke point.

Can you cook with it?
During cooking, fatty acids can oxidize, meaning they react with oxygen and become damaged.
The double bonds in fatty acid molecules are mostly responsible for this.
For this reason, saturated fats — which have no double bonds — are resistant to high heat. Meanwhile, polyunsaturated fats — which have many double bonds — are more sensitive and can become damaged ( 49 ).
Olive oil contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids, which have only one double bond. Therefore, olive oil is fairly resistant to moderate heat ( 49 ).
In one 2007 study, researchers heated extra virgin olive oil to 356°F (180°C) for 36 hours and found that the oil was highly resistant to damage ( 50 ).
A 2017 review noted that olive oil is  comparable or better than other vegetable oils  for frying foods at temperatures ranging from 356–374°F (180–190°C) ( 51 ).
Overall, olive oil seems to be very safe, even for cooking at moderate temperatures.
Olive oil is fairly resistant to moderate heat and can be used safely for cooking.

Risks of extra virgin olive oil
Like other  types of fat , extra virgin olive oil is high in calories, with around 119 calories in each tablespoon (14 g) ( 5 ).
Eating more calories than you burn each day contributes to weight gain over time ( 52 ).
Therefore, if you’re not making other adjustments to your diet, consuming high amounts of olive oil could make it more challenging to  maintain a moderate weight .
Additionally, although uncommon, some people may also be allergic to olives and olive oil. If you experience symptoms of an allergic reaction after consuming olive oil, stop using it and speak with a healthcare professional ( 53 ).
Olive oil is high in calories and could contribute to weight gain if consumed in high amounts. Some people may also be allergic to olives and olive oil.
