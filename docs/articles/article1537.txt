Title: A High-Protein Diet Plan to Lose Weight and Improve Health

Protein is an important macronutrient for good health.
According to the  Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020–2025 , adult males should get at least 56 grams (g) of protein and adult females at least 46 g daily.
However, some  research  suggests that eating more than this amount may help you lose body weight and fat while retaining or even building muscle mass.
Keep reading to learn more about protein’s role in weight loss and how to eat a high protein diet.

Why is protein important?
Protein  is one of the three macronutrients, along with carbs and fat. It plays a  key role  in the formation, maintenance, and structure of your organs and tissues.
Protein has many  important bodily functions , such as:
muscle, bone, and skin repair and maintenance
antibody  and  enzyme  production
molecule transportation and storage
hormone regulation
Protein is made up of a chain that contains 20 smaller units called amino acids. Of these, nine are considered  essential amino acids . They must be consumed in food because your body can’t make them.

Protein’s effects on weight loss
Increasing your protein intake may help promote weight loss in  many different ways .
Protein  increases  the production of hormones like PYY and GLP-1, both of which help you feel full and satisfied. A  2020 review  also found that protein reduces levels of  ghrelin , known as the “hunger hormone.”
These effects of a high protein intake could lead to a natural reduction in food intake.
A  2018 review  found that higher protein intake may boost your  basal (BMR)  and  resting (RMM)  metabolic rates. This can help you burn more calories for several hours after eating, as well as during your sleep.
Protein may also  increase  how much energy your body uses to absorb, metabolize, and store food. This is called the thermic effect of food (TEF). The TEF for protein is  20–30% , meaning that 20–30% of the calories found in protein are used simply to digest it. Meanwhile, the TEF for carbs and fat is 5–10% and 0–3%, respectively.
Protein’s ability to suppress appetite, promote fullness, and increase your metabolism can help you lose weight.
A  2020 review  found that increasing protein intake promotes weight and fat loss while retaining muscle mass. The authors also note that high protein intake has long-term weight loss benefits and could help prevent weight regain.
Typically, when you reduce your calorie intake, your metabolism slows down. This is partly due to muscle loss. However, a higher protein intake can help protect against muscle loss and keep your metabolic rate up.
In addition to its effects on weight management, protein may also help:
increase muscle mass
reduce muscle loss during aging
reduce bone loss
improve wound healing

How much protein should you eat every day?
The  amount of protein you need every day  depends on several factors, such as your age and sex. The exact amount is also somewhat controversial.
The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of protein is 0.8 g per kilogram of body weight (g/kg/bw), or 0.36 g per pound of body weight (g/lbs/bw).
However, the authors of a  2019 review  suggest that this number is often misinterpreted as the ideal number. It’s only the minimum amount of protein required to prevent nutrient deficiencies and muscle loss in most healthy individuals.
Research suggests that eating more protein than the RDA may promote weight loss and overall health. For example:
A  2017 study  found that participants who ate a high protein diet of 1.34 g/kg/bw (0.6 g/lbs/bw) for more than 75% of the 6-month duration experienced significantly more weight loss than the group who followed the RDA requirements.
A  2016 review  found that eating up to 2 g/kg/bw (0.9 g/lbs/bw) may help promote strength and prevent muscle degeneration.
A  2015 study  found that females ages 65 years and older require 1.3 g/kg/bw (0.6 g/lbs/bw) of protein to help prevent age-related muscle loss.
A  2015 review  found that eating up to 1.6 g/kg/bw (0.7 g/lbs/bw) per day can help promote weight loss, reduce body fat, and maintain muscle mass.
Consuming protein beyond 2 g/kg/bw (0.9 g/lbs/bw) may not provide additional benefits. A  2013 study  found that participants who consumed 1.6 g/kg/bw (0.7 g/lbs/bw) lost slightly more fat and had similar gains in muscle compared to the group that consumed 2.4 g/kg/bw (1.1 g/lbs/bw).
A  high protein diet  for weight loss and overall health should provide about  1.2–2 g/kg/bw , or 0.6–0.9 g/lbs/bw.
So, if you weigh 68 kg (150 lbs), this provides 82–136 g of protein daily.
Speak with a healthcare professional or registered dietician if you want to lose weight and are unsure about how many calories and grams of protein you should be eating. They can develop a nutrition plan that’s right for you.

Sample high protein meal plan

How to follow a high protein diet
A high protein diet can be customized according to your food preferences and health-related goals. For instance, you can follow a:
low carb, high protein diet  to help manage your blood sugar levels
dairy-free, high protein diet  if you’re lactose intolerant
plant-based, high protein  diet if you’re vegetarian or vegan
Here are a  few basic guidelines  to help you follow a high protein diet:
use a  food diary app  or website to help you establish, track, and maintain your protein values and goals
eat protein at breakfast
include a combination of  animal and plant proteins  in your diet
choose  high-quality protein sources , rather than  processed meats
consume  well-balanced meals

What are the risks of eating a high protein diet?
High protein diets are generally safe and healthy for most people.
For example, a  2019 review  found that contrary to popular belief, high protein intake above the RDA doesn’t cause kidney problems in people with normal kidney function.
That said, you may need to  eat a low protein diet  to preserve kidney function if you’ve received a diagnosis of moderate to advanced kidney disease.
A  2022 review  also found that nondairy animal protein, total meat and meat products, and processed meat were linked with a higher risk of  kidney stones . However, dairy protein was associated with a lower risk of kidney stones.
Speak with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian about how much protein you should consume each day if you have  kidney disease .
