Title: Natural Ways to Get Rid of Nausea, Plus Tips

Anti-nausea medications can help with nausea symptoms. However, they often have side effects, such as drowsiness. Some people may prefer to explore natural remedies for nausea.
Nausea is unpleasant and can happen due to many causes, including pregnancy and travel.
Here are 11 home remedies that help you eliminate nausea without using medications.

1. Eat ginger
Ginger  is a popular natural remedy for nausea.
It is not clear how ginger specifically treats nausea. However, experts believe ginger compounds may work similarly to anti-nausea medications. Several studies agree that ginger may help reduce nausea in various situations.
For instance, consuming ginger may effectively  decrease nausea  during pregnancy or  after chemotherapy  treatment.
There is no consensus regarding the most effective dosage, but some studies suggest that taking  1,500 milligrams  (mg) of ginger daily may be beneficial for easing nausea.
Ginger use is safe for most people. But it may cause side effects,  including  heartburn when consumed in high amounts. While there are only a small number of studies on ginger, those involving healthy pregnant people  report  a low risk of side effects. Thus, most experts consider ginger a safe, effective remedy for  morning sickness  during pregnancy.
A daily dose of ginger may be an effective alternative to anti-nausea medications in a variety of situations, including during pregnancy and after chemotherapy.

2. Peppermint aromatherapy
Peppermint  aromatherapy  may also help reduce nausea.
One study of 100 people found that peppermint essential oil  significantly improved  nausea when used alone or alongside medications.
In another study, peppermint oil  reduced  the frequency of nausea, vomiting, and retching in people undergoing chemotherapy.
In a  third study , using an inhaler containing peppermint oil at the onset of nausea reduced symptoms — within 2 minutes of treatment — in 79% of cases.
Sipping  peppermint tea  may have similar anti-nausea effects. Yet while you have little to lose by giving peppermint tea a try, no studies currently confirm its effectiveness.
Still, remember that there is little information on the safety of ingesting peppermint oil. For this reason, more studies on peppermint pills or peppermint tea are necessary to fully explore peppermint’s efficacy.
Smelling peppermint oil at the onset of nausea may help reduce your symptoms.

3. Acupuncture or acupressure
Acupuncture and acupressure are traditional Chinese remedies for nausea and vomiting.
During  acupuncture , a therapist inserts thin needles into specific points on the body. In contrast, acupressure aims to stimulate the same points of the body but uses pressure instead of needles.
Both techniques stimulate nerve fibers, which transmit signals to the brain and spinal cord. Some believe these signals can decrease nausea.
One review found that acupuncture  could reduce  the severity of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. Another review of 12 studies  suggested  acupuncture may be more effective than a placebo or usual care at relieving nausea and vomiting after an operation.
Some evidence  suggests acupuncture may reduce  nausea  during pregnancy. However, other  research  in this area is inconclusive.
Most studies that  report  a benefit stimulated the Neiguan acupuncture point, also known as the P6 or inner frontier gate point.
You can stimulate this nerve on your own simply by placing your thumb 2–3 finger widths down from your inner wrist, between the two prominent tendons.
Here is an illustration showing how you can find this point yourself.
Once you’ve located it, press down with your thumb for about one minute before repeating the same procedure on your other arm. Repeat if needed.
Acupuncture and acupressure are two scientifically proven techniques to reduce nausea.

4. Lemon
Citrusy smells, such as those from freshly sliced  lemon , may help reduce pregnancy-related nausea.
In one older study from 2014, 100 pregnant people inhaled either lemon essential oil or almond oil as soon as they felt nausea.
At the end of the 4-day study, those in the lemon group rated their nausea  9% lower  than those given the almond oil placebo.
Slicing a lemon or scratching its peel may work because it helps release its essential oils into the air. A vial of  lemon essential oil  may be a practical alternative when you’re away from home.
Citrusy smells, whether from a freshly cut lemon or from store-bought essential oils, may help reduce pregnancy-related nausea.

5. Control your breathing
Taking slow, deep breaths can also help reduce nausea.
In one  2020 study , practicing breathing exercises for 6 days significantly improved nausea, vomiting, and retching caused by chemotherapy.
Another study had similar findings, reporting that people who performed deep breathing exercises after surgery  experienced  a reduction in the severity of nausea immediately after the procedure and 12 hours and 24 hours later.
A common  breathing exercise  that may be beneficial involves inhaling through your nose to a count of three, holding your breath to a count of three, then exhaling to a count of three.
Specific controlled breathing techniques are a free and effective home remedy for nausea.

6. Use certain spices
Some people recommend certain  spices  as home remedies to relieve nausea.
Most of them are supported solely by anecdotal evidence. But some older research suggests that some spices may have nausea-fighting abilities. These can include:
Fennel powder , which  may reduce  menstrual symptoms, including nausea, and help people experience shorter periods.
Cinnamon , which  may decrease  the severity of nausea that some people experience during menstruation
Cumin extract , which may  help improve symptoms  such as abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, and diarrhea in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome
Although these three spices may help relieve nausea in certain people, very few studies examine their direct impact.
It’s also worth noting that the studies above used doses ranging from 180–420 mg per day. These mega-doses are difficult to achieve through the everyday use of these spices.
Certain spices may successfully reduce the frequency or severity of nausea. However, large doses may be required and more studies are needed to confirm these effects.

7. Muscle relaxation
Relaxing your muscles may help relieve nausea.
Progressive muscle relaxation  (PMR), a relaxation technique, requires individuals to tense and relax their muscles continuously to achieve physical and mental relaxation. A recent review found that PMR effectively reduces the severity of nausea resulting from chemotherapy.
Another way to relieve muscle tension is through massage. According to a 2020 study, foot massages may effectively reduce nausea and vomiting in people undergoing chemotherapy.
Relaxing your muscles, whether through massage or PMR techniques, may help relieve nausea.

8. Vitamin B6 supplements
Vitamin B6  is an alternative treatment for pregnant people who prefer to avoid anti-nausea medications.
A recent review of research  reports  that supplements of vitamin B6, also known as pyridoxine, successfully reduce nausea during pregnancy. For this reason,  experts recommend  taking vitamin B6 supplements during pregnancy as a first-line treatment against mild nausea.
Taking vitamin B6 doses of up to  10–25 mg  three or four times daily is generally considered safe during pregnancy and produces virtually no side effects.
Nevertheless, there haven’t been many studies on this topic, and more research is still needed.
For pregnant people who are experiencing nausea, vitamin B6 is a safe and potentially effective alternative to anti-nausea medications.

9. Make changes to your diet
Making small changes to your meal plan may help relieve nausea.
For example, eating a  bland diet  made up of foods that are easy to digest — such as bananas, rice, applesauce, crackers, or baked potatoes —  may relieve  nausea and decrease the likelihood of an upset stomach.
Opting for smaller, more frequent meals when feeling nauseated  may also help  reduce your symptoms.
Some research also  suggests  that eating protein-rich meals could improve symptoms of nausea more effectively than meals high in fat or carbohydrates.
After each meal, be sure to stay upright for 30–60 minutes, which  could help prevent  nausea caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
Eating small frequent meals and opting for foods that are rich in protein or easy to digest may help ease nausea. Staying upright after eating could also be beneficial.

10. Stay active
Getting regular physical activity may help keep nausea at bay.
A smaller study in 42 pregnant people  linked  increased physical activity with decreased severity of nausea.
Another study found that a single session of resistance or endurance training in women with breast cancer  improved  chemotherapy-related side effects, including nausea and fatigue.
Certain types of physical activity, such as  yoga , might be especially beneficial for nausea. One study in people undergoing chemotherapy found that pairing yoga with medications for vomiting  reduced  vomiting and severe nausea more effectively than medications alone.
Physical activity may help decrease nausea and vomiting. Certain types, such as yoga, might be especially beneficial.

11. Drink plenty of water
Dehydration , when your body loses more water than it consumes, can cause many symptoms, including headache and fatigue. For some people, it may also worsen nausea. So staying hydrated is essential, especially if you’re feeling nauseous.
If you experience nausea with vomiting, try replacing lost fluids with electrolyte-rich ones. These can include:
flat mineral water
vegetable broth
sports drinks
Dehydration may worsen nausea for some people. Drinking plenty of fluids can be beneficial, particularly if you experience nausea with vomiting.
