Title: 6 Benefits of Cordyceps, All Backed by Science

Cordyceps is a genus of parasitic fungi that grows on insect larvae. It contains various components that may be beneficial to your health in different ways. However, more research on humans is needed to confirm this.
When these fungi attack their host, they replace its tissue and sprout long, slender stems that grow outside the host’s body.
For centuries, traditional Chinese medicine has used the remains of insects and fungi to treat fatigue, sickness, kidney disease, and low sex drive.
Supplements and products containing Cordyceps extract have become increasingly popular due to their many purported health benefits.
Of the approximately  700  species of Cordyceps discovered, two have become the focus of health research: Cordyceps sinensis and Cordyceps militaris.
However, much of this research is limited to animal or lab studies, so health experts currently can’t draw conclusions about their effects on people. However, their potential health benefits are promising.
This article highlights six potential benefits of Cordyceps based on science.

Exercise
Cordyceps  may help increase  the body’s production of the molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is essential for delivering energy to the muscles. This may improve the way your body uses oxygen, especially during exercise.
For example, in a  2024 study , 14 young adults were given either a placebo or 1 gram (g) of Cordyceps before a high intensity interval exercise session. The researchers found that those who took Cordyceps had less muscle damage and faster cell repair, allowing for quicker recovery.
That said, this was a very small human study. Other recent studies involved animals. For instance, in a  2020 study , researchers found that Cordyceps extract slightly increased grip strength in mice, which could be attributed to an increase in ATP production.
But older  research  about Cordyceps and exercise is  contradictory . For this reason, more human research is needed to replicate this effect and to determine the exact mechanism involved with greater certainty.

Aging and skin
Cordyceps contains  polyphenols , which can act as antioxidants or help boost antioxidant activity.  Antioxidants  are molecules that  fight cell damage  by neutralizing free radicals, which can otherwise contribute to disease and aging.
A  2024 study  that analyzed Cordyceps extract in a test tube and then tested it in a clinical trial with 40 human participants found that the fungus may have adaptogenic properties, meaning it may help the body cope better with stress. The extract also appeared to have antioxidant properties and increased the production of collagen in the skin.
While this suggests that the fungus may be helpful both for healthy skin and longevity, previous  studies  have only been conducted on  animals . More research is needed to verify this conclusion.

Cancer
Cordyceps’ potential to slow  tumor growth has generated significant interest in recent years. In test-tube studies, Cordyceps has  been shown to inhibit the growth of many types of human cancer cells, including  lung ,  colon ,  skin , and  liver  cancers.
Studies in mice have also shown that Cordyceps may have anti-tumor effects on  leukemia ,  breast cancer , and  lung cancer .
However, these studies were also performed in animals and test tubes, not humans, so health experts can’t currently draw conclusions.

Diabetes and cholesterol
Research from 2018  on mice with diabetes suggests that Cordyceps  may help decrease  blood sugar and lipid levels.
This suggests that Cordyceps  may be helpful  in treating conditions like  diabetes  or atherosclerosis, which is the buildup of fat and cholesterol in the arteries.
However, as with other potential therapeutic uses of Cordyceps, these studies do not provide conclusive evidence about its effects on humans.

Heart health
Cordyceps may have a beneficial effect on heart health.
For example, a  2019 mouse study  tested the effect of Cordyceps on the heart in mice compared with a placebo, finding that it helped prevent heart enlargement by helping reduce oxidative stress.
This matters because the buildup of harmful oxidative stress in the heart can lead to  cardiac hypertrophy . Some researchers attribute this to Cordyceps containing adenosine, which is a naturally occurring compound that may have heart-protective effects.
In addition, the effect of Cordyceps on blood fats like triglycerides may be indirectly linked to a lower risk of heart disease because a higher level in the blood is a  risk factor for heart problems.
That said, more human-based research evidence is needed for the fungus’s effect on heart health. A  2022 review  of 19 trials of 1,805 human subjects with  arrhythmia  did find some improvements in the markers of  bradycardia  and  tachycardia  in some of the studies, but more study is necessary.

Inflammation
Although short-term inflammation is important in the healing process, long-term inflammation can lead to diseases.
Research from 2020  has shown that when human cells are exposed to Cordyceps, special proteins that increase inflammation in the body become suppressed.
Because of these potential effects, researchers believe Cordyceps may serve as a useful anti-inflammatory supplement or drug.
For example, in a  2022 animal study , researchers found that the fungus helped reduce inflammation related to arthritis, while other  research  had similar findings in terms of asthma and allergic rhinitis.
That said, the potential inflammation-fighting properties of Cordyceps have yet to be observed in humans.

Dosage and safety
Cordyceps  sinensis is difficult to harvest and can cost  up to  $20,000  per kilogram (kg) or about $8,000 per pound. For this reason, the majority of Cordyceps supplements contain a synthetically grown version called Cordyceps CS-4.
Due to limited human research, there is no consensus on dosages. A 2018 study used a dosage of  1,000 to 4,000 milligrams per day , which wasn’t associated with side effects.
The fungus’s ongoing history of use in traditional Chinese medicine suggests it’s nontoxic. In fact, the Chinese government approved Cordyceps CS-4 for use in hospitals and  recognizes  it as a safe, natural drug.
Research also seems to confirm this. In a  2021 study  on mice, researchers found that giving up to 20 g per kg of Cordyceps orally for 14 days didn’t result in any deaths or abnormalities in organs or tissues.
Similarly, in a  2019 review , researchers didn’t find any major side effects other than rare, minor effects like dry mouth, bloating, rashes, or loss of appetite.
That said, it’s not possible to completely exclude the possibility of serious adverse effects such as an allergic reaction. More safety testing in humans is needed.

The bottom line
Cordyceps are used in traditional Chinese medicine for various health issues, but there is limited research on their effects on humans.
Animal and lab studies show potential for improving heart health and fighting inflammation, cancer, diabetes, and aging. Studies have also shown a potential benefit during exercise.
However, more human research is needed to determine whether these benefits are legitimate and to determine the proper dosage and safety of Cordyceps supplements.
