Title: How to Stock Your Pantry for Quick & Easy Meals in Minutes

If you’ve ever enjoyed the glorious combination that is pasta and cheese, you know that quick, delicious meals don’t always take fancy ingredients to create.
When a busy schedule has you on the run, wouldn’t it be nice if  every  meal was so easy?
The key may be in having the right ingredients constantly on-hand. By stocking your kitchen with a few strategic basics, quick, easy meals don’t have to be a magical unicorn.
Like a well-curated wardrobe, a well-dressed pantry features foods that mix and match beautifully for all sorts of mealtime combos.
The goal: Get dinner on the table with as little effort as possible. The materials: these 15 staples.

1. Black beans
You can think of black beans as the little black dress of dinnertime. They slip comfortably into almost anything.
Try them in:
tacos
soup
bean burgers
salads
veggie medleys
Try whipping up  these black bean burgers  for your next Meatless Monday.
A half-can of leftover black beans might not seem super inspiring, but it can be the start of a unique second meal.
Mash the beans and spread them on flatbread for a creative Southwestern pizza topped with tomatoes, melted cheddar, and cilantro, or toss a few atop baked sweet potatoes sprinkled with chili powder, oregano, salt, and pepper.
If there were an award for all-around highly nutritious foods,  black beans  would be a top contender. They’re high in both protein and fiber, two nutrients known for helping maintain a healthy weight. They’re also rich in antioxidants and may  promote blood sugar control .

2. Rotisserie chicken
For a quick and easy meal, you can’t go wrong with the pre-cooked convenience of rotisserie chicken. Just strip the meat off the bones and you’re ready to rock.
Add a little chicken to one of the dishes below for a bit of added protein.
pasta
casserole
stew
salads
sandwiches
One possibility: Simmer up a 15-minute white chicken chili with rotisserie chicken, white beans, green chilies, chicken broth, and a dash of cumin.
If you have time, consider removing the meat from a rotisserie chicken as soon as you bring it home, then store it in the fridge. That way, dinner prep will happen even faster.
Or keep a sealed container of the meat in your freezer for up to 6 months.
Rotisserie chicken does tend to contain more sodium than straight-up chicken breasts or thighs, but its protein content is the same as any other chicken.
A 3-ounce serving of the meat contains  24 grams of protein  for building strong muscles and supporting your immune system.

3. Frozen meatballs
Come dinnertime, frozen meatballs can totally save your bacon — or get wrapped in it!
These meaty mealtime starters can add heft to  Italian subs  with the addition of marinara and mozzarella. Want to add some green? Add a handful of spinach or arugula.
Or microwave them for a shortcut to Swedish meatballs over egg noodles.
Once you’ve cooked frozen meatballs, it’s best not to re-freeze them. Stash them in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. Pull them out for later use in wraps, spaghetti, or albondigas.
Frozen meatballs aren’t necessarily brimming with antioxidants or healthy fats—but they  are  an  excellent source  of:
protein
vitamin B12
iron
zinc
Just read labels to be sure you know what you’re getting. Typically, a shorter ingredient list indicates a less processed product.

4. Canned tuna
Another easy protein to the rescue: canned tuna! Unlike fresh fish, which requires cooking, canned tuna is a quick route to oodles of lunches and dinners.
For example, enjoy Mediterranean-style pasta featuring your favorite noodles.
Add:
tuna packed in olive oil
Parmesan shavings
fresh basil
a squeeze of lemon juice
Or hollow out a large fresh heirloom tomato and serve tuna salad inside.
A wee bit of extra tuna can hang out in your fridge for 1 or 2 days. Try mixing it with mayo and using it to top sliced cucumbers for a mini appetizer.
Besides its noteworthy protein content, canned tuna shines for its  omega-3 fatty acids . These healthy fats have been linked to health benefits galore, from  reduced risk of cardiovascular disease  to  better sleep .

5. Couscous
When even pasta takes too long, turn to  couscous . It can hit the table after just a 3-minute spin in the microwave.
An all-in-one couscous grain bowl makes a dinner that’s not just quick, but portable too.
Mix the grains with cooked chicken (the rotisserie kind, perhaps?).
Add fresh veggies like tomatoes and cucumbers.
Sprinkle in a dash of feta cheese.
Drizzle with olive oil and boom—dinner is served!
Cooked couscous lasts in the refrigerator for about 3 days. When you’ve staggered through the door after a crazy day, a container in the fridge is an instant side dish for meats or a perfect foundation for a casserole.
If you don’t mind splurging, opt for whole wheat couscous. It provides more fiber than the refined variety, helping optimize digestion, keeping you full, and  feeding the healthy bacteria in your gut .

6. Sourdough bread
Sourdough is a king among bread.
It’s equally at home as the crust of an egg bake, the underpinnings of an impromptu pizza, or the heart and soul of French toast.
And of course, there’s always sourdough avocado toast.
Crunch, crunch, crunch… so many dishes can get a textural update from crispy bread crumbs.
Try sprinkling them on mac and cheese, stuffed squash, or green beans. To do it, toast extra sourdough bread and process it in the food processor until it turns to a crumbl-like consistency.
You can also freeze sourdough for about 3 months.
Who said bread isn’t healthy? Sourdough contains live and active cultures that promote gut health and may be  easier to digest  than regular bread because of the fermentation process.

7. Tortillas
Tortillas can go far beyond the realm of Mexican food—though they certainly don’t have to!
Besides the usual tortas, tostadas, and enchiladas, try a flour tortilla as a vehicle for a lunchtime veggie wrap.
Or, for a kid-pleasing lunchbox centerpiece, try this:
Spread cream cheese on a tortilla.
Add deli meat and a colorful sliced or shredded veggie.
Then roll and slice into pinwheels.
It’s not hard to find a use for an extra tortilla or two. Finish off the package by wrapping up a leftover green salad, roasted veggies, or scrambled eggs.
Or go for a classic microwave quesadilla!
Each type of tortilla—flour, corn, spinach, etc.—comes with its own nutrient profile, so they’re somewhat difficult to compare.
Tortillas alone are a good source of a few nutrients like B vitamins. Plus, their hand-held convenience can help you pack in more nutrients from veggies, beans, and lean proteins. Choose a whole-grain or corn tortilla to add even more fiber to your plate.

8. Marinara sauce
You  could  simmer your own homemade marinara sauce from garden-fresh tomatoes and herbs, but for meals in a flash, jarred marinara is your friend.
Not only is it an obvious choice for spaghetti or other pasta, but it can also add tomato-y oomph to DIY  pizzas , sliders, and subs.
Elevate pizza night (quickly) with purchased  garlic  naan bread, a schmear of marinara, mozzarella, diced roasted red peppers, and olives.
Close the lid tightly on jarred marinara and pop it in the fridge. If you won’t use it within a week or two, stick it in the freezer instead: it will last 6 months.
If you’ve got just a smidge to use up, slip it into chili or meatloaf. Everyone will wonder about the  je nais se quoi  ingredient that added such savory flavor.
With tomatoes as its first ingredient, marinara sauce features some of their health benefits, like ample amounts of the antioxidant lycopene. Lycopene helps quell inflammation—which may be why it’s been linked to reduced risk of  certain cancers  and  improved vascular health .
However, be sure to check the ingredients and choose a jar with minimal added sugar.

9. Marinated artichokes
Vegetables like potatoes and squash take ages to soften in the oven. For a quicker route to veggie goodness, opt for jarred artichokes (choose a marinated variety for pre-infused flavor).
They’re a zero-cook addition to pasta and salad, plus an elegant topper for quick-bite appetizers like crostini.
An opened jar of marinated artichokes should live in the fridge for the remainder of its days. These veggies can stay good for up to 3 weeks.
Artichokes are high in inflammation-fighting  polyphenols , high in fiber, and low in fat.

10. Jarred garlic
Why hassle with mincing cloves? Snagging jarred garlic means meals are a snap.
Try it in:
soups
gnocchi
garlic bread
pesto
You can also try jarred garlic as the first step for a  sautéed greens side dish  or a surprisingly zesty  pot roast .
Jarred garlic can make its home in your fridge as far as its expiration date, which may be as long as 3 months from purchase.
Including garlic in your diet could come with a host of health benefits.
A  2020 study  correlated garlic with the potential prevention of cancer, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases like diabetes. It makes the garlic breath seem a little more worth it.

11. Frozen mixed vegetables
Frozen mixed vegetables  are a cook’s best friend for loading up meals on the fly.
Add them to:
soups
shepherd’s pie
fried rice
steamed greens
Having them on hand in the freezer means veggies can color up your diet with just the shake of a bag.
There’s literally no easier food to store in the freezer than frozen mixed veggies. After cooking, you can preserve leftovers in the refrigerator for 5-7 days.
Depending on your blend, you’ll find a mix of nutrients like:
vitamin C
fiber
potassium
folic acid
vitamin A
All these nutrients have a major impact! Some  research  has shown that vegetable consumption is inversely related to death from any cause.

12. Hummus
Hummus can become your go-to spread for far more than veggie dipping.
Its creamy texture can serve as a mayo replacement in sandwiches and wraps or the base of sturdy salad dressings. It’s also a near-essential part of a charcuterie board, which just so happens to be a super easy meal.
Refrigerated hummus can stay good in the fridge for 1-2 weeks. Haul it out whenever you need a quick side dish, like crackers or crudites — or spread some on toast and sprinkle with pomegranate seeds for a healthy breakfast.
This gift from the Mediterranean has become the centerpiece of healthy entertaining for good reason. Tahini (sesame paste) provides healthy fats while the chickpea base comes packed with fiber and protein.
People who eat more plant-based protein may have a longer life expectancy, according to  2019 research .

13. Frozen mashed potatoes
Raw potatoes aren’t exactly helpful for dinner in a flash—but pre-mashed spuds in the freezer make quick work.
Any time you need a speedy side dish, grab the bag from your freezer. It’ll start you off on the right foot as an accompaniment to a  mustard-baked chicken , meatballs, or a quick  lemon-and-capers salmon dinner .
Purchased mashed potatoes can chill out in the freezer for up to 6 months. Once cooked, store them in the fridge. You can get creative with leftovers by stuffing them into samosas or enchiladas or frying them up as potato latkes.
Potatoes get a bad rap for their high carb count, but they  aren’t as bad for you as you might think .
They have plenty of potassium, the mineral that helps your muscles and nerves contract properly, and their resistant starch might improve blood sugar control, according to a  2021 study .

14. Shredded cheddar
For an all-purpose shredded cheese that goes on just about anything, choose cheddar.
Rich and easily meltable, it tames spice and tops off household favorites, like:
chili
quesadillas
baked potatoes
mac and cheese
You’ll get the best results from your shredded cheddar if you keep it tightly sealed in the fridge. Cheese  can be frozen  too. Leave a bag in the freezer for six to nine months.
Cheddar is known for its  calcium . A quarter-cup serving contains  15 percent of the Daily Value .
This mineral supports:
healthy bones
blood clotting
heart rhythm
muscle movement
hormone balance
The cheese also contains a moderate amount of protein.

15. Greek yogurt
Greek yogurt, how do we love you? Let us count the ways.
Try it in:
parfaits
smoothies
in dips and dressings
as an alternative to sour cream
in a pudding or pie filling
Even more ideas: Use Greek yogurt to coat chicken or pork before breading or to make tzatziki sauce for falafel.
Greek yogurt will keep in the fridge for about 2 weeks. Technically, you can freeze it for up to 2 months, but this may change its consistency.
Nutritionally, Greek yogurt has so many good things going for it. It offers ample protein, calcium, and gut-friendly probiotics to name a few.

Takeaway
Good things may take time, but when it comes to making healthy meals, there’s no shame in a few shortcuts.
Stock your kitchen with these combinable essentials and you won’t have to bat an eye next time you need dinner in minutes.
