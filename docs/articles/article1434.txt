Title: 10 Natural Ways to Balance Your Hormones

Certain lifestyle practices, including exercising regularly, and eating a nutritious diet rich is protein and fiber can help naturally balance your hormones.
Hormones are chemical messengers that have profound effects on your mental, physical, and emotional health. For instance, they play a major role in controlling your appetite, weight, and mood.
Your body typically produces the precise amount of each hormone needed for various processes to keep you healthy.
However, sedentary lifestyles and Western dietary patterns may affect your hormonal environment. In addition, levels of certain hormones decline with age, and some people experience a more dramatic decrease than others.
A nutritious diet and other healthy lifestyle habits may help improve your hormonal health and allow you to feel and perform your best.

Eat enough protein at every meal
Consuming adequate amounts of protein is extremely important.
Not only does protein  provide  essential amino acids that your body can’t make on its own, but your body also needs it to produce protein-derived hormones — also known as peptide hormones.
Your endocrine glands make these hormones from amino acids. Peptide hormones play a crucial role in regulating many physiological processes, such as growth, energy metabolism, appetite, stress, and reproduction.
For example, protein intake  influences  hormones that control appetite and food intake, communicating information about energy status to your brain.
Research has shown that eating protein  decreases  the hunger hormone  ghrelin  and  stimulates  the production of hormones that help you feel full, including peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).
One  3-month study  in 156 teenagers with obesity correlated a high protein breakfast with increased PYY and GLP-1 levels, which resulted in weight loss due to increased feelings of fullness.
Experts recommend eating a minimum of 15–30 grams of protein per meal. You can do this by including  high protein foods  such as eggs, chicken breast, lentils, or fish at each meal.

Engage in regular exercise
Physical activity strongly influences hormonal health. Aside from improving blood flow to your muscles, exercise increases hormone receptor sensitivity, meaning that it enhances the delivery of nutrients and hormone signals.
A major  benefit of exercise  is its  ability  to reduce insulin levels and increase insulin sensitivity.
Insulin is a hormone that allows cells to take up sugar from your bloodstream to use for energy. However, if you have a condition called  insulin resistance , your cells may not effectively react to insulin. This condition is a risk factor for diabetes, obesity, and heart disease.
However, while some researchers still debate whether the improvements come from exercise itself or from losing weight or fat,  evidence shows  that regular exercise may improve insulin resistance independently of body weight or fat mass reduction.
Many types of physical activity have been found to help prevent insulin resistance, including  high intensity interval training ,  strength training , and  cardio .
Being physically active  may also  help boost levels of muscle-maintaining hormones that decline with age,  such as  testosterone, IGF-1, DHEA, and growth hormone (HGH).
For people who cannot perform vigorous exercise, even regular walking  may increase  key hormone levels, potentially improving strength and quality of life.

Maintain a moderate weight
Weight gain is directly associated with hormonal imbalances that may lead to complications in insulin sensitivity and reproductive health.
Obesity is  strongly related  to the development of insulin resistance, while losing excess weight  is linked  to  improvements  in insulin resistance and  reduced  risk of diabetes and heart disease.
Obesity is also  associated  with  hypogonadism , a reduction or absence of hormone secretion from the testes or ovaries. In fact, this condition is one of the  most relevant  hormonal complications of obesity in people assigned male at birth.
This means obesity is strongly related to lower levels of the reproductive hormone  testosterone  in people assigned male at birth and  contributes  to a lack of ovulation in people assigned female at birth, both of which are common causes of infertility.
Nonetheless, studies indicate that weight loss may reverse this condition. Eating  within  your own personal calorie range  can help  you maintain hormonal balance and a moderate weight.

Take care of your gut health
Your gut contains  more than  100 trillion friendly bacteria, which produce numerous metabolites that may affect hormone health both positively and negatively.
Your  gut microbiome  regulates hormones by modulating  insulin resistance  and  feelings of fullness .
For example, when your  gut microbiome  ferments fiber, it produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate.
Acetate and butyrate  may aid  weight management by increasing calorie burning and thus help prevent insulin resistance.
Acetate and butyrate  may also  regulate feelings of fullness by increasing the fullness hormones GLP-1 and PYY.
Interestingly,  studies in rodents show  that obesity may change the composition of the gut microbiome to promote insulin resistance and inflammation.
In addition, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) — components of certain bacteria in your gut microbiome — may increase your risk of insulin resistance. People with obesity  seem to have  higher levels of circulating LPS.
Here are some tips to  maintain healthy gut bacteria  which may also help you maintain a healthy hormone balance.

Lower your sugar intake
Minimizing added sugar intake may be instrumental in optimizing hormone function and avoiding obesity, diabetes, and other diseases.
The simple sugar fructose is present in many types of sugar, comprising up to  43% of honey ,  50% of refined table sugar , 55% of high fructose corn syrup, and 90% of agave.
In addition, sugar-sweetened beverages are the primary source of added sugars in the Western diet, and fructose is commonly used commercially in  soft drinks , fruit juice, and sport and energy drinks.
Fructose intake has increased exponentially in the United States since around 1980, and  studies consistently show  that eating added sugar  promotes  insulin resistance — at least  some of which  are independent of total calorie intake or weight gain .
Long-term fructose intake has been  linked to  disruptions of the gut microbiome, which may lead to other hormonal imbalances.
What’s more, fructose may fail to stimulate the production of the fullness hormone leptin, leading to decreased calorie burning and increased weight gain.
Therefore, reducing your intake of sugary drinks — and other sources of  added sugar  — may improve hormone health.

Try stress reduction techniques
Stress harms your hormones in several ways.
The hormone  cortisol  is known as the stress hormone because it helps your body cope with long-term stress.
Your body’s response to stress activates a cascade of events that leads to cortisol production. Once the stressor has passed, the response typically ends.
However, chronic stress  impairs  the feedback mechanisms that help return your hormonal systems to normal.
Therefore, chronic stress causes cortisol levels to  remain elevated , which stimulates appetite and increases your intake of sugary and high fat foods. In turn, this may lead to excessive calorie intake and obesity.
In addition, high cortisol levels stimulate gluconeogenesis — the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources — which may cause insulin resistance.
Notably, research shows that you can lower your cortisol levels by engaging in  stress reduction techniques  such as  meditation ,  yoga , and listening to  relaxing music .
Try to devote at least 5 minutes per day to these activities.

Consume healthy fats
Including high quality natural fats in your diet may help reduce insulin resistance and appetite.
Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs)  are unique fats that are less likely to be stored in fat tissue and more likely to be taken up directly by your liver for immediate use as energy, promoting increased calorie burning.
MCTs are also  less likely  to promote insulin resistance.
Furthermore, healthy fats such as  omega-3s  help increase insulin sensitivity by  reducing  inflammation and pro-inflammatory  markers .
Additionally, studies note that omega-3s  may prevent  cortisol levels  from increasing  during  stress .
These healthy fats are found in pure MCT oil, avocados, almonds, peanuts, macadamia nuts, hazelnuts, fatty fish, and olive and coconut oils.

Get consistent, high quality sleep
No matter how nutritious your diet or how consistent your exercise routine, getting enough restorative sleep is crucial for optimal health.
Poor sleep is  linked to  imbalances in many hormones, including insulin, cortisol,  leptin , ghrelin, and HGH.
For instance, not only does  sleep deprivation  impair insulin sensitivity, but poor sleep is associated with a 24-hour  increase  in cortisol levels, which may lead to insulin resistance.
In fact, one  small study  in 14 healthy adults found that 5 nights of sleep restriction decreased insulin sensitivity by 25%.
Moreover, studies  consistently show  that sleep deprivation results in increased ghrelin and decreased leptin levels.
In a  review of  21 studies in 2,250 people, those assigned to a short sleep group showed higher ghrelin levels than those who got the recommended amount of sleep.
Plus, your brain needs uninterrupted sleep to go through all five stages of each sleep cycle. This is especially important for the  release of  growth hormone, which occurs mainly at night during deep sleep.
To maintain optimal hormonal balance, aim for at least 7 hours of high quality  sleep per night .

Follow a high fiber diet
Fiber  is essential to a healthy diet.
Studies  have found that it  increases  insulin sensitivity and stimulates the production of hormones that make you feel full.
Although soluble fiber  tends to  produce the strongest effects on appetite by increasing fullness hormones, insoluble fiber may also play a role.
Your gut microbiome ferments soluble fiber in your colon, producing SCFAs that stimulate the release of the fullness hormones PYY and GLP-1.
As such, try to eat several  high fiber foods  each day.

Consider following the Mediterranean diet
Estrogen is a hormone  involved in  both female and male reproductive health, as well as blood sugar balance, bone and heart health, and immune and brain function.
Like other homrones, estrogen levels that are either too low or too high have been linked to acute and chronic health conditions, including obesity, metabolic disorders, and various cancers.
However, dietary choices may contribute to changes in your estrogen levels.
Research shows  that the Western diet — primarily composed of refined sugars and animal products — is linked to higher estrogen levels, which are a  risk factor  for breast and ovarian cancers.
On the contrary, following a Mediterranean-style diet rich in whole grains, seeds, fish, legumes, and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower may help  reduce estrogen levels  and, thus, cancer risk.
Similarly, long-term adherence to the  Mediterranean diet  may reduce breast cancer risk  before and after  menopause — stages that are  characterized by  low estrogen levels.
Researchers believe that this diet increases your intake of protective plant compounds such as polyphenols and lignans.

The bottom line
Your hormones are involved in every aspect of your health. You need them in very specific amounts for your body to function optimally.
Hormone imbalances may increase your risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and other health conditions.
Although aging and other factors that affect hormones are beyond your control, you can take several steps to help manage your hormone levels.
Consuming nutritious foods, exercising regularly, and engaging in other health-promoting behaviors such as meditating and getting enough sleep may go a long way toward improving your hormonal health.
