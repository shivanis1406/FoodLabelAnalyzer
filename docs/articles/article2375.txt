Title: Are Apples Weight-Loss-Friendly or Fattening?

Apples have several properties that increase feelings of fullness, which may aid weight loss by reducing overall calorie intake.
Research suggests that including apples in a balanced diet may promote weight loss and improve overall health.
Apples have several properties, for example, that may boost blood sugar control, heart health, and brain function.
Regarding weight loss, it’s worth noting that apples are high in water, low in calorie density, and low in overall calories.
They’re also fiber-rich, which may promote fullness and appetite reduction — and, therefore, weight control.

Low calorie density
A medium-sized apple consists of  about 86% water . Water-rich foods are  quite filling , which often leads to reduced calorie intake.
Water also lowers the  calorie density  of foods. For example, a medium-sized apple has about 95 calories.
Several  studies show  that foods with low calorie densities promote fullness, reduced calorie intake, and  weight loss .
In an  older 2008 study , apples caused reduced calorie intake and weight loss, while oat cookies — which had a higher calorie density but similar calorie and fiber contents — did not.

High in weight-loss-friendly fiber
A medium-sized apple contains  about 4 grams  of fiber, which is considered high given its low calorie content. This makes apples an excellent food to help you reach your  recommended fiber intake .
Many studies demonstrate that high fiber intake is  linked to  lower body weight and a reduced risk of  obesity .
Eating fiber may  slow the digestion of food  and make you feel more full with fewer calories.
Fiber  may also  improve your digestive health and feed the  friendly bacteria in your gut , aiding  metabolic health  and weight control.

Very filling
The combination of water and fiber in apples makes them  incredibly filling .
In one  2020 study , whole apples were found to be significantly more filling than  applesauce  or  apple juice .
Furthermore, apples take significantly longer to eat compared with foods that don’t contain fiber.  Eating duration  likewise contributes to fullness.
The filling effects of apples may reduce appetite and lead to weight reduction.

Benefits for weight loss
Researchers have proposed that including apples in a  balanced diet  may encourage  weight loss .
In studies of women with excess weight who follow a  low calorie  or  weight-reduction  diet, apple intake is associated with weight loss.
In  one 2008 study , women regularly ate apples, pears, or oat cookies — foods with similar fiber and calorie contents. After 12 weeks, the fruit groups lost 2.7 pounds (1.2 kg), but the oat group showed no significant weight loss.
Researchers also gave 50 people 3 apples, 3 pears, or 3 oat cookies per day. After 10 weeks, the oat group saw no weight change, but those who ate apples lost 2 pounds (0.9 kg).
Additionally, the apple group reduced overall calorie intake by 25 calories per day, while the oat group ate slightly more calories.
In a  24-year study  of 124,086 adults, increased intake of fiber and antioxidant-rich fruits, such as apples, was associated with weight loss. Those who ate apples lost an average of  1.24 pounds  (0.56 kg).
Not only do apples appear to be weight-loss-friendly for adults, but they  may also  improve overall diet quality and reduce the risk of  obesity  in children.

Other health benefits associated with apples
In addition to promoting weight loss, apples have several other benefits.
Apples  contain  small amounts of many vitamins and minerals and are well known for their  vitamin C  and  potassium  contents. This fruit also boasts  vitamin K ,  vitamin B6 ,  manganese , and  copper .
The peels are particularly high in plant compounds  that may  lower your disease risk and provide many other health benefits.
Apples have a low  glycemic index (GI) , which measures how much blood sugar levels rise after eating.
Low-GI foods may aid  blood sugar control  and weight management since they  help keep  your blood sugar levels balanced rather than spiking them.
Some evidence  also suggests that a  low-GI diet  may help prevent diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.
The combination of nutrients in apples  may reduce  your risk of heart disease.
Apples have been shown to reduce your body’s cholesterol and inflammation levels, which are key factors for  heart health .
Other studies have found that foods rich in antioxidants, such as apples,  may lower  your risk of death from heart disease.
The antioxidant activity of apples may help prevent certain types of  cancer .
Research from 2016  links apple intake and lung cancer prevention in adults.
Furthermore, eating at least one  apple a day  has  been shown  to significantly reduce your risk of mouth, throat, breast, ovarian, and colon cancer.
According to animal studies, apple juice may help prevent  mental decline  and Alzheimer’s disease.
In  one 2004 study  of mice,  apple juice  reduced mental decline by decreasing the amount of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) in brain tissue.
Apple juice  may also  preserve neurotransmitters that are important for  optimal brain function  and Alzheimer’s prevention.

The bottom line
Apples are a good source of antioxidants, fiber, water, and several nutrients. The many healthy components of apples may contribute to fullness and reduced calorie intake.
Including this fruit in a healthy and well-balanced diet may be useful for weight loss.
