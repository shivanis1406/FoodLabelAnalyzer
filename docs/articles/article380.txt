Title: SCD: Can the Specific Carbohydrate Diet Improve Your Digestion?

SCD is often promoted for people with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but very few studies support its effectiveness.
Over the last decade, the incidence of IBD  has increased  worldwide. Symptoms are often painful and include diarrhea, bleeding ulcers, and anemia.
Elimination diets, such as SCD, have gained traction as potential treatments for IBD and other inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.
While SCD was introduced in the 1920s by gastroenterologist Sidney Haas, it was expanded and popularized in the 1980s with Elaine Gottschall’s book “Breaking the Vicious Cycle.”

What is the Specific Carbohydrate Diet?
SCD is an elimination diet that emphasizes removing certain types of carbohydrate-containing foods based on their chemical structure.
The governing theory behind SCD is that  complex carbs  encourage an overgrowth of  unhealthy bacteria  in your small intestine if you have IBD.
As these bacteria grow, they produce byproducts that  promote inflammation  and eventually lead to reduced absorption of nutrients in your  digestive tract .
SCD proponents claim that it inhibits the growth of such bacteria and restores digestive function by eliminating all carbohydrate food sources with two or more linked sugar molecules.
Though many carbs are prohibited, the SCD does permit carb sources that have single, unbound sugar molecules — or  monosaccharides  — as your digestive tract absorbs them more easily.

What foods do you avoid with the Specific Carbohydrate Diet?
The diet labels any food or  additive  containing two or more chemically linked sugar molecules “illegal.” The SCD guidebook, “Breaking the Vicious Cycle,” collectively refers to these foods as  complex carbs .
In scientific terms, any food with disaccharides,  oligosaccharides , or polysaccharides will appear on the list of illegal foods.
As you can imagine, the list of banned foods is extensive. Common examples include:
Potatoes
Grains  and pseudo-grains, including rice, wheat, corn, quinoa, and millet
Processed meats  and  meats with additives
Most  dairy
Most  legumes
Most processed sugar,  artificial sweeteners , and  sugar alcohols
The general structure of SCD is very rigid and intended to be followed exactly as outlined in the guidebook — with little to no room for flexibility.
While some people may reintroduce certain banned foods after symptoms subside, this will vary depending on your response to the diet.

What foods do you eat with the Specific Carbohydrate Diet?
SCD-approved foods are collectively called “legal.” Most of the foods on this list are  unprocessed, whole foods  that don’t offer many complex carbs.
The main sources of approved or “legal” carbs in the SCD come from the monosaccharides  glucose ,  fructose , and galactose.
Common examples include:
Fruits:  Most  fresh or frozen  fruits and juices.  Canned  fruits may be allowed if they don’t have added sugar or starch.
Vegetables:  Most vegetables, except for potatoes, yams, plantains, and some other  high-starch vegetables
Meat:  Most fresh meats, as long as they don’t contain any fillers or additives
Eggs
Some dairy:  Homemade yogurt  fermented  for at least 24 hours and some  natural cheeses
Certain legumes:  Some dried legumes, as long as they’re  soaked and prepared  according to the directions outlined in the guidebook
Nuts and nut butter:  Most nuts, as long as they’re free from added starch or sugar
Herbs and spices:  Most  dried or fresh  herbs and spices. Prepackaged blends may contain additives and are typically discouraged
The SCD guidebook recommends eating only the explicitly legal foods to avoid inadvertently ingesting something banned.

Can the Specific Carbohydrate Diet be used to treat digestive disorders?
SCD was originally designed as a therapy for people with  celiac disease  and IBD, an umbrella term that includes  ulcerative colitis  and  Crohn’s disease .
These diseases can hamper your ability to  digest and absorb nutrients  from food. Thus, SCD aims to heal intestinal tissue in order to restore its functions.
SCD’s promoters claim that some people are less adept at digesting foods — such as grains, legumes,  refined sugar , and high-starch food additives — that result from settled agricultural practices and the modern food industry.
Supporters assert that continued ingestion of these carbs leads to an overgrowth of unhealthy bacteria in your gut, which promotes inflammation and eventually diminishes your ability to digest.
Strict adherence to SCD will purportedly starve these bacteria by depriving them of food, allowing your gut tissue to heal. To this day, SCD is primarily used to treat intestinal disorders — but with varied success.
One of the major criticisms of this diet is its lack of concrete scientific evidence.
Most available data is  weak and limited  to very small studies or anecdotal evidence, which isn’t enough to state whether or not the SCD works definitively.
Ultimately, more research is needed to determine whether SCD is truly an effective treatment for IBD.

Can the Specific Carbohydrate Diet be used for other medical conditions?
SCD is also marketed for people with other medical conditions, including  autism spectrum disorder (ASD)  and  cystic fibrosis (CF) .
Early research suggests that gut bacteria may be crucial in treating some  behavioral  and  inflammatory  conditions, such as CF and ASD.
SCD is believed to balance your digestive tract, leading its proponents to theorize that it may be an effective therapy for these conditions, too.
However, the scientific understanding of these disorders is limited. Beyond anecdotal reports, there is no research to suggest that SCD treats diseases outside of IBD — if that.
In fact, it’s still unclear whether the SCD impacts  gut bacteria  at all. More research is needed to understand if SCD affects ASD or CF.

What are the potential risks of the Specific Carbohydrate Diet?
When well planned, the SCD can be  balanced , complete, and healthy. However, SCD eliminates large groups of nutrient-dense foods that are beneficial for most people, including  whole grains , some legumes, and most dairy.
Eliminating these foods without replacing their key nutrients could result in poor diet quality and subsequent nutritional deficiencies.
Maintaining good nutrition may already  prove difficult  if you have IBD. Adopting an extremely restrictive diet like SCD  could increase  your risk of  malnutrition  and associated complications.
If you’re considering this diet, consult with a  registered dietitian  or qualified healthcare professional to make sure you’re meeting your nutritional needs.

Should you try the Specific Carbohydrate Diet?
While anecdotal evidence indicates that SCD may improve IBD symptoms in some people, there’s no guarantee that it will work for everyone.
Medical conditions like IBD are complex, and specific interventions may pan out differently for different people.
With current evidence, it remains unclear if the diet plays any role in IBD treatment.
That said, a well-planned  elimination diet  may be worthwhile, especially if you want to avoid the more serious risks associated with certain long-term medications and surgeries.
While dieting is a personal decision, you should discuss SCD with a qualified healthcare professional before making any major lifestyle changes.

The bottom line
SCD is an elimination diet designed to treat symptoms of IBD and restore digestive function by purging many carb-containing foods.
While some people may notice improvements in their IBD symptoms, very little research supports its effectiveness beyond a placebo effect.
Due to the restrictive nature of the diet, it could increase your risk of malnutrition.
If you’re considering SCD, discuss it with a healthcare professional or dietitian first to reduce possible risks and ensure a balanced diet.
