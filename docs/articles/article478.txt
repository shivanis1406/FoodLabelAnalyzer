Title: Is It Safe to Eat Cookie Dough?

When you’re whipping up a batch of cookies, it’s tempting to taste some of that delicious dough raw.
Still, you may wonder whether eating raw cookie dough is safe, or whether the risks of bacterial contamination and food poisoning outweigh the joy of the simple treat.
This article reviews the safety of eating raw cookie dough and provides a recipe for a safe-to-eat variety.

Cookie dough contains raw eggs
Most cookie dough contains  raw eggs . Although eggs are typically heat-sterilized, some bacteria can remain on the outer shell.
When the egg is cracked, the bacteria from the shell can contaminate the food the eggs are added to. Eggs are commonly contaminated with  Salmonella  bacteria ( 1 ).
Salmonella  infection is characterized by fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping beginning about 12 hours after consuming the  contaminated food , and typically lasts up to 7 days ( 1 ).
However, severe cases may require hospitalization and can even develop into sepsis — a widespread bacterial infection ( 2 ).
Luckily, the odds of contracting a  Salmonella  infection are relatively small. Still, in the United States, there are about 79,000 reports of illness and 30 deaths per year from  Salmonella  infections related to eating raw or under-cooked eggs ( 1 ).
Pregnant women, older adults, children, and those with compromised immune systems should not consume raw cookie dough or uncooked eggs. For these people,  Salmonella  infections can be more severe and life threatening ( 1 ).
Most cookie dough contains raw eggs, which may be contaminated with  Salmonella  bacteria. These bacteria cause fever, diarrhea, and vomiting, which can last for up to 1 week.

Contains raw flour
Raw cookie dough also contains uncooked flour, which can present a health risk of its own.
Unlike eggs, which are heat-sterilized to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination,  flour  is not treated to kill pathogens. Any bacteria present in flour are typically killed during cooking ( 3 ).
Therefore, eating raw flour may cause you to get sick if it’s contaminated with harmful bacteria like  E. coli  ( 3 ,  4 ).
E. coli  can cause severe stomach cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea that persist for 5–7 days ( 3 ).
For raw flour to be safe without cooking it, you need to heat-sterilize it at home.
You can do this by spreading the flour on a cookie sheet and baking it at 350 ° F (175 ° C) for 5 minutes, or until the flour reaches 160 ° F (70 ° C).
Raw cookie dough also contains uncooked flour, which can be contaminated with  E. coli  — a bacteria that causes cramping, vomiting, and diarrhea.
