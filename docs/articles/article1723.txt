Title: What Are Liquid Aminos, and Can They Benefit Your Health?



Liquid aminos, like Bragg liquid aminos, are a healthy gluten-free substitute for soy sauce and other seasonings. They have several health benefits, like decreasing hunger, but can pose risks to some people.
Liquid aminos are culinary seasonings that look and taste similar to soy sauce.
They can be made by fermenting coconut sap with salt and water or treating soybeans with an acidic solution to break them down into free amino acids.
They add a savory, salty flavor to meals and are naturally vegan and gluten-free.
Here are 6 benefits of liquid aminos.

1. Contain amino acids
Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.
They are very important for building muscle, regulating gene expression, cell signaling, and immunity ( 1 ,  2 ).
There are two types of amino acids — essential and non-essential.
Your body can produce non-essential amino acids, but  essential amino acids  can only be obtained from your diet ( 3 ).
Manufacturers claim that soy-based liquid aminos contain 16 amino acids, while coconut-based ones offer 17, including both essential and non-essential. However, no independent research supports these claims.
Summary  Liquid aminos contain  essential and non-essential amino acids, both of which play many critical roles  in your body.

2. Naturally gluten-free
Soy sauce is made by fermenting cooked soybeans and roasted wheat with salt, water, and yeast or mold until a rich, salty sauce is produced ( 4 ).
In contrast, liquid aminos are made by mixing hydrolyzed soybeans or fermented coconut sap with water, resulting in a naturally gluten-free product.
Thus, those following a  gluten-free diet  commonly use them in place of soy sauce.
Since roughly 5% of the world cannot eat gluten due to gluten-related disorders, liquid aminos are a useful product for many people ( 5 ,  6 ).
Additionally, coconut aminos are particularly popular among people following the paleo diet, as they cannot eat legumes like soybeans.
Summary  Liquid aminos do not  contain wheat, making them popular soy sauce substitutes for those following a  gluten-free diet.

3. Milder taste than soy sauce
Liquid aminos are often described as tasting like a mild soy sauce.  Soy sauce  has a rich taste, while liquid aminos are milder and slightly sweet.
Both soy sauce and soy-based liquid aminos are high in sodium, containing around 300 mg per teaspoon (5 ml). Meanwhile, coconut aminos contain about 60% less ( 7 ,  8 ,  9 ).
In soy-based liquid aminos,  sodium  is formed during processing, while coconut-based liquid aminos have sea salt added to them.
Since the color, texture, and flavor of liquid aminos and soy sauce are similar, they can be used interchangeably in most recipes.
Nonetheless, for recipes that involve reducing a sauce, coconut aminos are a good choice, as they won’t become overwhelmingly salty.
Summary  Liquid aminos taste like  a mild soy sauce with a salty, savory flavor and a hint of sweetness. In fact,  the two can be used interchangeably in most recipes.

4. Don’t contain chemical preservatives
Commercially prepared soy sauces often contain sodium benzoate.
Sodium benzoate  is a preservative that’s added to foods to increase their shelf life and prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi ( 10 ,  11 ).
While it’s generally recognized as safe when consumed in small quantities, some people are allergic to it, finding that it may trigger hives, itching, swelling, or runny nose ( 12 ,  13 ,  14 ).
Liquid aminos do not contain any  chemical preservatives , so they’re a good choice for people who cannot consume benzoates.
Summary  Liquid aminos do not  contain sodium benzoate, so they’re a good option for people who must avoid  this preservative.

5. May reduce hunger
Umami is one of the five major taste sensations, alongside salty, sweet, sour, and bitter.
Its flavor is described as savory or meaty and triggered by the presence of free glutamate. Free glutamate is formed in foods when glutamic acid, an amino acid naturally found in protein, is broken down ( 4 ,  15 ).
Liquid aminos contain natural glutamate due to the breakdown of proteins in soybeans or coconut sap, so they stimulate an umami flavor sensation and make food taste more enjoyable ( 16 ).
Research has found that consuming umami-flavored broths and soups before meals can reduce feelings of hunger and decrease the desire to snack ( 17 ,  18 ,  19 ).
One study examined the brain activity of women who tended to overeat at meals.
When the women drank chicken broth containing  monosodium glutamate  (MSG), a food additive rich in glutamate and umami flavor, they showed greater brain activity in regions responsible for self-control while viewing images of food and making dietary decisions ( 18 ).
However, it’s unclear whether  umami foods  lead to weight loss or reduced calorie intake throughout the day, so more studies in this area are needed ( 17 ).
Summary  Eating umami-rich foods  like liquid aminos before meals may increase satisfaction during a meal and  reduce hunger afterward, but they have not been linked to weight loss.

6. Easy to add to your diet
Liquid aminos are very easy to add to your diet.
Some creative ways to use them include:
as a soy sauce replacement in  stir-fries and sauces
in salad dressings and dips for a  salty, savory kick
stirred into soups and stews for  extra umami flavor
drizzled onto oven-roasted vegetables  or mashed potatoes
roasted with  nuts  for a savory snack
stirred into rice and beans
added to marinades for  tofu , tempeh, or meat
drizzled over fresh-popped popcorn
as a dipping sauce for sushi
as a seasoning  for cauliflower fried rice
Liquid aminos store well in a cool, dark pantry for three to six months after opening.
Summary  Liquid aminos can be used  in a wide variety of dishes to add a savory, salty, umami flavor.

Potential downsides and precautions
While liquid aminos are a great option for people looking for a gluten-free soy sauce substitute, there are some downsides to consider.
Soy-based liquid aminos are not appropriate for those with a soy allergy.
However,  coconut aminos  make a great substitute.
Liquid aminos cost about three times more than traditional soy sauce and may be difficult to find in grocery stores, although they can be purchased  online .
Because of this, many people without special dietary needs choose to stick with soy sauce.
Soy-based liquid aminos have slightly more sodium than soy sauce, containing 320 mg per 1-teaspoon (5-ml) serving, compared to 293 mg of sodium in soy sauce ( 7 ,  9 ).
Some studies have linked high intakes of sodium to adverse health outcomes, such as an increased risk of stomach cancer and high blood pressure ( 20 ,  21 ).
It’s generally recommended to keep  your sodium intake  below 2,300 mg per day to reduce these risks ( 22 ).
Some people, such as those with salt-sensitive high blood pressure or  kidney disease , may need to consume less ( 23 ,  24 ).
Just 3 servings of soy-based liquid aminos can account for 41% of this daily allowance, making it difficult to stay within these guidelines if you consume high amounts.
Coconut aminos are a good lower-sodium alternative, with just 130 mg per teaspoon (5 ml), but they should still be consumed in moderation ( 8 ).
Summary  Liquid aminos may not be  appropriate for people who are allergic to soy or coconut. Soy liquid aminos  are high in sodium, and both soy and coconut liquid aminos are more expensive  than traditional soy sauce.

The bottom line
Liquid aminos are cooking seasonings that look and taste very similar to soy sauce.
They can be made from either soybeans or coconut sap and are naturally gluten-free, so they work for a wide variety of diets.
Liquid aminos contain both essential and non-essential amino acids, but since they’re used in such small quantities, they’re not a significant source of dietary protein.
Their free glutamate content gives them a savory umami flavor that reduces hunger after meals and makes food more palatable and filling.
Liquid aminos can be used as a substitute for soy sauce in most dishes or anywhere you’d like to add a salty, savory taste.
