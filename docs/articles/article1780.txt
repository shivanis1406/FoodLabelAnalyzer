Title: The 10 Best Selenium Supplements, According to a Dietitian

Selenium is a mineral that’s essential to health in numerous ways. Your body incorporates selenium into special types of proteins called selenoproteins.
Selenoproteins are necessary for important functions such as the production of thyroid hormones. Plus, they have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects ( 1 ).
Low selenium levels have been associated with a number of negative health outcomes, including suppressed immune function and an increased risk of anxiety, infertility, heart disease, and even death ( 2 ).
You need to get selenium from your diet. It is found in both animal- and plant-derived foods, including meat, grains, Brazil nuts, fish, and eggs. However, selenium concentrations in both plant- and animal-derived foods vary due to fluctuations in the selenium content of soil ( 3 ).
In 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reduced the recommend Daily Value (DV) for selenium from 70 mcg to 55 mcg ( 4 ).
Some people, including those who follow vegan diets, those with HIV, and those who have kidney failure requiring dialysis, are at risk of developing selenium deficiency ( 3 ,  5 ).
Moreover, research has shown that selenium supplements may be beneficial for improving immune function in certain populations and reducing symptoms related to some health conditions, such as autoimmune thyroid disease ( 6 ,  7 ).
For these reasons, many people choose to supplement with selenium by taking either a selenium supplement or a multinutrient supplement that contains selenium.

Best selenium supplements for immune support
Selenium is essential for the health and functioning of your immune system ( 11 ).

EpiCor has been shown to reduce inflammation and support the body’s immune response in some small, limited research studies sponsored by Embria Health Sciences, the creator of EpiCor ( 13 ,  14 ).
Both studies had limitations, including a very small sample size, and some testing was conducted on animals instead of humans. Thus, further research will be needed to better understand EpiCor and its role in human immune health.

It contains a large amount of vitamin E — more than 1,000% of the DV. And some studies suggest that long-term supplementation with high doses of vitamin E may increase the risk of prostate cancer in healthy men ( 15 ).
For this reason, men who have prostate cancer or have a family history of it should check with a healthcare professional to find out whether this supplement is safe and appropriate for them.
Carlson’s  website  mentions that their supplements are tested by an FDA-registered laboratory for potency and quality. However, the website does not disclose whether their supplements are tested by a third party.

Best selenium supplement for prostate health
Supplementing with selenium has been associated with improved  prostate health  in some studies and may help protect against prostate cancer in men with low blood levels of selenium ( 16 ,  17 ).
However, other studies have noted an association between selenium supplements and high grade prostate cancer or found no benefit of selenium in reducing prostate cancer risk ( 18 ).
It’s likely that selenium supplements have varying effects on prostate health based on blood selenium levels, genetics, and other factors and may be beneficial for only certain people.
If you’re interested in taking selenium for prostate health or prostate cancer prevention, it’s important to consult a healthcare professional to make sure a supplement is safe for you.

A quick comparison

How to choose
When searching for a selenium supplement, it’s important to understand that more isn’t necessarily better. In fact, taking too much selenium can be dangerous, which is why a Tolerable Upper Intake Level of 400 mcg per day has been set for selenium intake ( 3 ).
Although research shows that higher doses can be safely tolerated, it’s important to consult a qualified healthcare professional to assess your selenium needs before supplementing with selenium.
Doses of 5,000 mcg and higher can cause toxicity and lead to respiratory distress, heart attack, and kidney failure ( 28 ).
Most selenium supplements contain between 25 and 200 mcg of selenium per serving — well under the set upper limit.
When shopping for a selenium supplement, look for products that undergo independent testing for quality and try to purchase supplements from trusted sites or directly from the manufacturer whenever possible.

If selenium reaches toxic levels in your body, it can lead to dangerous symptoms like respiratory distress syndrome, heart attack, kidney failure, and heart failure. It can even lead to death.
Keep in mind that selenium toxicity is usually caused by people taking excessively high amounts of selenium as a result of product mislabeling ( 3 ).
Most people don’t need to supplement with selenium because the nutrient is present in many foods, including nuts, fish, meat, and eggs.
Generally healthy people who consume a well-rounded diet should not supplement with high doses of selenium, as this can lead to excessive selenium intake, which can harm health.
