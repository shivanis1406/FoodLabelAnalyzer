Title: 6 Evidence-Based Health Benefits of Lemons

Lemons contain nutrients that may help support your cardiovascular health. They may also help protect against conditions such as kidney stones and anemia.
Lemons are a type of citrus fruit that derive from the flowering plant  Rutaceae . The fruit is native to parts of Asia, primarily Northeast India.
Lemons are high in vitamin C, fiber, and various beneficial plant compounds. These nutrients are responsible for several health benefits, such as wound healing and tissue development and repair.
In fact, reserach shows that lemons may also support heart health, weight control, and digestive health.
Here are 6 evidence-based health benefits of lemons.

1. Support heart health
Lemons are a good source of vitamin C. One peeled lemon provides about 53 mg of vitamin C, which is almost  60%  of the reference daily intake (RDI).
Research shows that eating fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C  reduces your risk  of heart disease and stroke.
However,  vitamin C is not the only vitamin thought to be  good for the  heart . The fiber compounds in the pith (white exterior) of lemon could also  lower  some risk factors for heart disease.

2. Help manage weight
Lemons are often promoted as a  weight loss food , and there are a few theories as to why this is.
A  2021 study  found that the soluble pectin fiber in them expands in your stomach, which may help you feel full for longer.
That said, not many people eat lemons whole. And because lemon juice contains no pectin, lemon juice drinks will not promote fullness in the same way.
It is a popular belief that drinking hot water with lemon will help you  lose weight .
However, there is no research that supports this.

3. Prevent kidney stones
Kidney stones  are small lumps that form when waste products crystallize and build up in your kidneys. They are quite common, and  people who get them  often get them repeatedly.
Citric acid  may help prevent  kidney stones by increasing urine volume and increasing urine pH, creating a less favorable environment for kidney stone formation.
Just a  half cup ( 4 ounces  or 125  ml) of lemon juice daily may provide enough citric acid to help prevent stone formation in people who have already had them.
However, more well-conducted studies are still needed to confirm whether lemon juice affects kidney stone formation.

4. Protect against anemia
Iron deficiency anemia is quite common. It occurs when you donâ€™t get enough  iron  from the foods you eat.
Lemons contain some iron, but they primarily prevent anemia by  improving your absorption  of iron from plant foods.
Your gut absorbs iron from meat, chicken, and  fish  (known as heme iron) very easily, while iron from plant sources (non-heme iron) does not absorb as easily. However, this absorption can be improved by consuming vitamin C and citric acid.
Because lemons contain both vitamin C and citric acid, they may protect against anemia by ensuring that you absorb as much iron as possible from your diet.

5. Reduce cancer risk
A healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables  can help prevent  some cancers.
Some observational studies have found that people who eat the most citrus fruit have a  lower risk  of lung cancer, while other studies have found no effects.
While some plant compounds from lemons and other citrus fruits may have anticancer potential, no quality evidence suggests that lemons can fight cancer in humans.

6. Improve digestive health
Lemons  contain about  10%  carbohy drates, mostly  soluble fiber  and simple sugars.
The main fiber in lemons is pectin, a form of soluble fiber linked to multiple health benefits.
Soluble fiber  can improve  gut health and slow the digestion of sugars and starches. These effects may result in  reduced blood sugar levels .
However, to get the benefits of fiber from lemons, you need to  eat the pulp . People who drink lemon juice without the pulp will miss out on the benefits of fiber.

The bottom line
Lemons contain a high amount of vitamin C, soluble fiber, and plant compounds that give them a number of health benefits.
Lemons may aid weight loss and reduce your risk of heart disease, anemia, kidney stones, digestive issues, and cancer.
Lemons are not only a very healthy fruit but  also have a distinct, pleasant taste and smell that make them a great addition to foods and drinks.
