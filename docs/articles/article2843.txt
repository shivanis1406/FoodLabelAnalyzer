Meal delivery services can be a quick and convenient way to enjoy more healthy meals at home. But these services can range quite a bit in price, with some costing even two or three times as much as others.
We’ve tested nearly 30 of the top  meal delivery services  on the market to determine the best budget-friendly options available, all of which start at less than $10 per serving. We included both prepared meals and meal kits for your consideration.
Here are our recommendations for the five cheapest meal delivery services for 2024, and a closer look at how they compare. Kelli McGrane, our nutrition editor and registered dietitian, shares her experiences with some of the meal delivery services below, as well as a few other Healthline contributors.

Price   $4.99
*Price may vary.
What we like:  Offering meal delivery kits starting at $5.99 per serving for couples and $4.99 per serving for families, EveryPlate is one of the most affordable meal delivery services on the market.
Similar to its parent company HelloFresh, EveryPlate features a weekly rotating menu with family-friendly recipes, like Honey Sriracha Fried Chicken and Stuffed Bell Pepper Soup.
The company offers five meal plans, including Nutrish & Delish, which features meals that are nutritionally balanced and contain around 650 calories or less per serving.
EveryPlate also features a few vegetarian-friendly recipes each week. However, it isn’t the best option if you follow a specific diet, such a  vegan  or  keto .
“EveryPlate is an affordable alternative to pricier meal kit delivery services. The website was easy to navigate, the ingredients arrived in good condition, and the meals were simple to prepare.
“Out of the three meals I tried, my family really enjoyed two of them. With that said, I did end up adding additional ingredients to most of the dishes to boost the flavor and nutrition profile, such as diced tomato and fresh avocado slices to the fajitas.
“While it wouldn’t be my first choice, I do think EveryPlate is a good option for families trying to cut back on ordering takeout and who need a more affordable alternative to HelloFresh or Blue Apron.”

What we like:  HelloFresh is one of the most popular and affordable meal delivery services available. And with more than 45 recipes to choose from each week, there’s sure to be a recipe for even the  pickiest eater  in your household.
The service also clearly labels meals that are low prep and quick to make, which are ideal for families on busy weeknights. Our testers agree that ingredients almost always arrived in good condition, and they managed to find meals toddlers enjoyed. However, once or twice, there was a “sad” carrot or overripe tomato.
Each box includes preportioned ingredients and a recipe card with step-by-step instructions. According to one of our reviewers, the meals are straightforward; you don’t need special skills, and only basic slicing and chopping are needed for the vegetables.
In addition to weekly meal kits, subscribers can add additional items from the HelloFresh Market, including breakfast items, quick lunches, side dishes, desserts, and more.
But HelloFresh is not necessarily the best option if you’re vegan, avoid dairy products, or follow a specific diet, like keto or paleo.
“HelloFresh’s huge selection of recipes made it easy for me to find dishes that would appeal to my family — including my picky toddler. All of the ingredients were grouped by recipe, so each meal only took me 30 or 40 minutes to prepare.
“While HelloFresh doesn’t have as many options for certain diets like keto or paleo, it has a larger weekly menu than many other services and offers a good range of cuisines and ingredients.”
— SaVanna Shoemaker, MS, RDN, LD, Healthline writer
“My experience has been that meals on the menu each week are packed securely in bags based on the recipe, with any meat selection in their own individual, leak-proof plastic packaging at the bottom of the box where the ice pack is. Any add-ons from the HelloFresh market, like a side of asparagus or what they call “quick meals” like sliders or hot chicken sandwiches, come packed loose in their respective packaging. The loose packed quick meals was a little confusing to me the first time I ordered a couple as add-ons to my usual meals because it’s just the ingredients. I had to look at my account to remind myself what the dish was and any instructions involved in preparing it.
“We’ve tried a lot of meals from tried-and-true HelloFresh classics like their taco and burger recipes to their seasonally-inspired recipes, such as the Vietnamese shrimp skewers & shaking beef. For this review, I’ll focus on meals from the last 2 weeks that are vegetarian-friendly: the Creamy Vegan Mushroom Stew and the Jammy Onion & Brussels Sprout Cavatappi.
“We had both meals as-is, except that we cut out the sour cream from the Cavatappi pasta dish. We didn’t add anything extra, but the Jammy Onion & Brussel Sprouts Cavatappi meal was lacking something. It didn’t end up having any sauce to speak of, probably in part because we omitted the sour cream, and the noodles could just absorb the liquid that was there.
“The fresh produce for these meals all came in good condition with the exception of the bag of pre-cute kale. The edges of some of the kale stalks were looking old and starting to get discolored. I’ve been using HelloFresh every month for the last year, and have used them off and on for a few years at this point. The vegetables we’ve gotten this year have been fresh and good quality for the most part, only one or two sad carrots.
I just wish HelloFresh had more options that didn’t include cheese and dairy ingredients. I often have to omit dairy from my cooking, so I either end up wasting those ingredients. I appreciate that their recipes are flexible enough that they’re good, even without cheese or with a little tweaking, but it’s a waste when I’m getting regular deliveries. Those packets pile up.”
– Candice Abellon, Healthline editor
“In general, my ingredients arrived fresh and in good condition, though occasionally, a tomato would be unripened. We also received chicken once that was supposed to arrive pre-cooked, but it was still raw in the middle.
“I’ve tried HelloFresh several times over the years. Most recently, I tried it for about 4 months over the winter when I was tired of meal planning. I enjoyed being able to select from any of the company’s menus and never struggled to find recipes that my toddler would enjoy. Initially, I found the variety of meals to be great. I wish that there were more Fresh & Fit recipes and more unique ingredients/flavor combinations. After 4 months of subscribing, I was definitely feeling ready to try a new service to have a change in recipe types.
“In general, HelloFresh meals are well-seasoned and have a good variety of textures. With that said, there were several times when I found ingredients (especially tomatoes) to be less flavorful than what you’d buy in the grocery store. I also often found myself adding ingredients or seasonings. The Coconut Tofu Curry had a great balance of sweet and spicy that my toddler loved. The Firecracker Meatballs are always delicious, though I definitely find myself wanting an extra squeeze of lime on them. The Med Couscous Bowls are another toddler favorite and include a good mix of whole grains, vegetables, and chickpeas (though the ratio of chickpeas is a bit high).
“The recipes never called for ingredients beyond pantry staples. However, there were several dishes where I added ingredients for additional flavor or nutrition, such as avocado, fresh diced tomato, roasted vegetables, and feta cheese.
“I did like that they would have specialty menus each month, such as summer-inspired and Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month-inspired dishes.”

What we like:  Daily Harvest offers a variety of  plant-based  smoothies, oat bowls, and bite-sized snacks, all of which contain creative flavor profiles that are packed with nutrient-rich ingredients, like fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.
In addition to being fully plant-based, all Daily Harvest items are  gluten-free  and mostly  organic .
While we like the service best for its breakfast and snack offerings, the company also offers flatbreads, harvest bowls, soups, and pastas for people looking to stock their freezers with easy lunches.
Just keep in mind that many of these items are relatively low in calories and protein, so they might not be filling enough for many adults.
Each week, you can mix and match your favorite meals from the full menu to create your own box with 9, 14, or 24 items.
“I liked most of the items I tried from Daily Harvest, and they were generally pretty easy to prepare. The snack bites, oat bowls, and chia bowls were my favorites, plus they were super convenient for breakfasts and snacks.
“I also appreciated that the menu includes a wide range of plant-based ingredients, which can help keep things from feeling repetitive over time.
“That said, I found that most of the entrees weren’t filling enough for a full meal, and a few items didn’t keep their texture well after reheating.”

What we like:  Dinnerly provides meal delivery kits that are delicious, easy to make, and affordable. In fact, most of its recipes take less than 30 minutes to make, with some requiring zero prep work aside from opening packages and combining the ingredients in a pan.
While it doesn’t offer multiple menus like many other meal kit companies do, Dinnerly’s large menu includes labels, like  low calorie  or vegan, to help you find recipes that fit your dietary needs and preferences.
In addition to meal kits, Dinnerly subscribers can add breakfast, brunch, and dessert items to their order.
“All of the recipes I tried from Dinnerly were very easy to make and took less than 30 minutes from start to finish.
“For example, I only needed one bowl to prepare the Creamy Tomato Basil Tortellini with Peas, which made cleanup a breeze. While I did add a few more vegetables to the dish to make it more balanced, the flavors were spot-on, and even my toddler enjoyed it.

What we like:  Mosaic Foods offers a wide range of veggie bowls, pizzas, soups, smoothies, and oat bowls, all of which are plant-based and  fully prepared,  making it our budget-friendly choice for best prepared meal delivery service.
Not only are Mosaic Food’s meals packed with vegetables, but their soups and veggie bowls also contain at least 10 grams of protein to help keep you full until your next meal.
All menu items are free of artificial ingredients, and some meals also feature  organic  produce, depending on availability.
What’s more, unlike other prepared meal delivery services that cater only to singles, Mosaic Foods offers a line of family-sized, oven-ready meals, including Veggie Pot Pie and Buffalo Cauliflower Pasta Bake.
Note:   Our score for Mosaic Foods is based only on its family-sized meals.
“I tried several of the family meals and appreciated that all I needed to do was bake them. Plus, they could be served in the same dish, so cleaning up after dinner was super easy. Every family meal includes at least four different vegetables, and I really enjoyed most of the flavors.
“The only downside was that some of the meals needed more time in the oven than the instructions called for, with one meal taking over 90 minutes to heat.”

Comparing the cheapest meal delivery services

How we test meal delivery services
We’ve  tested  nearly 30 of the most popular meal delivery services on the market. Testers select a week’s worth of meals from multiple menus to get a well-rounded view of the types of flavors and ingredients offered.
As part of our testing, we consider several factors, including the ease of the signup and meal selection process, the variety and nutritional composition of the meals offered, ingredient quality and freshness, ease of cooking, and, of course, the taste. We score them accordingly.
Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate menus and ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the meal delivery services on this page, we considered all the services that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further.  Read more about how we test meal delivery services.

How to choose an affordable meal delivery service
There are a few factors you may want to consider when selecting a  meal delivery service  to ensure that the company fits your lifestyle and budget:
Types of meals:  Consider whether you’re looking for fully prepared meals that can be reheated in the microwave or if you prefer meal kits that require some prep work and cooking.
Recipe variety:  While some services change their menu every week, others have a static menu that may have new or seasonal items added to it occasionally. It’s also a wise idea to take a peek at the menu to see the types of flavors and ingredients that the service offers.
Dietary needs:  If you follow a specific diet, such as keto or vegan, or have other dietary needs, such as lower calorie or  gluten-free meals , be sure to choose a service that caters to your needs and preferences. Similarly, if you have health goal, such as losing weight, you might look for cost-effective options for the best meal delivery service for  weight loss .
Cost per serving:  When deciding whether a service fits your budget, be sure to consider the cost per serving. Many services become cheaper the more food you order.
Shipping:  Most meal delivery services charge a fee for shipping. Because these fees can be as high as $20 (or more if you live in Alaska or Hawaii), it’s important to factor shipping into the total weekly cost.
Coupons:  Many companies offer promotional deals to new customers or discount their meals at certain times of the year. These deals can be a great way to try out a service without paying full price.
Delivery:  Finally, before you get your heart set on a service, it’s important to make sure that delivery is available in your area.
