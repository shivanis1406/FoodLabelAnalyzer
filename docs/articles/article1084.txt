Title: What is Red Dye 40?

Red Dye 40 is a synthetic food dye common in dairy products, sweets, and beverages. For most people, it is safe to consume and poses no health risk, but some may be allergic to it.
Red Dye 40 is one of the most widely used food dyes, as well as one of the most controversial. The dye is thought to be linked to allergies, migraine, and mental disorders in children.
Red Dye 40 is a synthetic color additive or  food dye  made from petroleum. It’s  one of the nine  certified color additives the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves for use in foods and beverages. The European Union also approves its use.
Certified color additives must undergo FDA certification every time a new batch is produced to ensure they contain what they’re legally supposed to.
Conversely, exempt color additives do not require batch certification, but the FDA must still approve them before they can be used in foods or beverages.
Exempt color additives come from natural sources, such as fruits, vegetables, herbs, minerals, and insects.

Is Red Dye 40 safe?
In health terms, the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  defines Red Dye 40 to be of low concern.
Furthermore, the Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization agree that the estimated dietary exposure to Red Dye 40 for people of all ages is  not a health concern .
Red Dye 40 has an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of  3.2 mg per pound  (7 mg per kg) of body weight. This translates to 476 mg for a 150-pound (68-kg) person.
The ADI is an estimate of the amount of a substance in food that can be consumed daily over a lifetime without adverse health effects.
One study showed that Americans ages 2 years and older consumed an average of  0.002 mg  of Red Dye 40 per pound (0.004 mg per kg) of body weight per day.
Another study observed that Americans’ intake of Red Dye 40 may be higher, with those ages 2 years and older consuming a daily average of  0.045 mg per pound  (0.1 mg per kg) of body weight .

Allergies and migraine
Some question the safety of Red Dye 40, as its consumption is thought to cause allergies and  migraine .
Allergies are your body’s immune response to a substance that does not cause a response in most people. These substances — called allergens — may be pollen, dust mites, mold, latex, food, or food components.
Some  research  has linked allergic reactions to migraine, a type of headache characterized by intense, throbbing pain.
Allergic reactions have been reported in children and adults for both synthetic and natural food colors, but they tend to be rare, mild, and  mainly involve the skin .

Behaviors in children
Red Dye 40 may have links to aggression and mental disorders like  attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD)  in children.
Children with ADHD are often easily distracted, have trouble concentrating on tasks, are forgetful in daily activities, fidget, and have outbursts of anger at inappropriate times.
The  FDA acknowledges  that, while the current research indicates that most children don’t experience adverse behavioral effects when consuming foods that contain Red Dye 40, some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to it.
While some  older studies  have proposed potential mechanisms by which food dyes may cause behavioral changes,  the bulk of evidence  does not support this claim.
