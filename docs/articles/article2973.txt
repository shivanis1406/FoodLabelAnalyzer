Sunbasket , which offers a variety of nutrient-dense meal kits that fit into many dietary patterns, is our pick for the best meal delivery service for people with diabetes.
The service offers a Diabetes-Friendly plan that’s designed specifically for people with diabetes. The meals on this plan contain at least 10 grams (g) of protein, 5 g of fiber, and 20 g to 70 g or fewer of high quality carbs per serving.
What’s more, Sunbasket uses mostly organic produce and eggs, as well as wild-caught seafood. The company employs a team of registered dietitians who assess recipes to ensure that they’re nutritionally complete.
“Out of all of the meal kits I’ve tried, Sunbasket’s ingredients tasted the freshest, especially the seafood and meats. I found most of the dishes to be bursting with flavor and appreciated the wide variety of ingredients used, especially vegetables,” says Healthline Nutrition Editor  Kelli McGrane , MS, RD.
Meals are delivered weekly, and most can be prepared in fewer than 30 minutes. Sunbasket also offers a variety of diabetes-friendly snack foods, such as egg bites,  bone broth , yogurt, protein bars, nuts, and jerky.
Here are a few examples of Diabetes-Friendly meals that Sunbasket offers:
Spicy Balinese Chicken with Cucumber-Cabbage Salad (36 carbs, 570 calories)
Meatloaf with Spring Vegetables and Lemon-Dill Aioli (22 carbs, 490 calories)
Stuffed Bell Peppers with Ground Turkey and Black Beans (37 carbs, 500 calories)
“While it isn’t cheap, I think Sunbasket offers the highest quality ingredients and most exciting flavor combinations,” McGrane says.

BistroMD stands out for its nutritious, doctor-designed meal plans, which may help you meet your health- and wellness-related goals. In particular, the service offers a diabetes-friendly program, with fully prepared, frozen meals that contain 25 g of net carbs per serving or fewer to help manage blood sugar levels.
A few sample selections from its Diabetes-Friendly plan include:
Stuffed Grape Leaves with Tomato Sauce (23 carbs, 250 calories)
Barramundi Seabass with Sweet Coconut Pineapple Sauce (26 carbs, 330 calories)
Grilled Chicken with Buffalo Sauce (21 carbs, 320 calories)
In addition to its diabetes plan, BistroMD also has programs specifically for heart health and menopause, along with meal plans that are ketogenic, vegan, and gluten-free.
You can opt for the full program — which includes all three meals per day — or choose to receive only lunches and dinners for 5 or 7 days each week. An assortment of add-on snacks is also available for an extra fee.
“I would recommend BistroMD to anyone looking for nutritious and diverse meals on the go,” says Healthline Editor Steven Rowe.
“Each meal had a good variety of flavors, veggies, and proteins. The taste and texture of the meals were also very good, which was surprising considering they were shipped and reheated in the microwave.”
Rowe also noted that the portions were large enough that he could often share his meals with his wife.

While  Factor  doesn’t have a diabetes-specific menu, the service’s prepared meals are created by a team of chefs and dietitians who ensure that each meal is nutritionally balanced. The service also offers several meal plans, including Calorie Smart, Keto, Protein Plus, Vegan & Veggie, Flexitarian, and Chef’s Choice.

The rotating weekly menu is packed with tasty dishes, such as:
Chive and Garlic Chicken (26 carbs, 410 calories)
Vegan Mushroom Marsala (49 carbs, 470 calories)
Italian Chickpea Bowl (56 carbs, 450 calories)
“I’ve  tried many prepared meal delivery services , and Factor meals have the best texture,” says Healthline Nutrition Editor Kelli McGrane. “Even after being reheated in the microwave, the vegetables were soft without being mushy, the grains were perfectly cooked, and the meats and fish were all juicy and not dry. I also really loved the flavors of the dishes.
“Some meals could’ve used more vegetables, but all of them were plenty flavorful. They were well-seasoned and featured delicious sauces that helped the meals stand out above competitors.
“I would highly recommend this service, as the ingredients are high quality and the meals are mostly balanced nutritionally.”

Green Chef  is a certified  organic meal kit delivery  service that uses fresh, seasonal ingredients and accommodates several dietary patterns, including offerings appropriate for managing diabetes.

As with any meal kit service, Green Chef provides all the ingredients, in pre-cut and pre-proportioned measurements, and an easy-to-follow recipe to make the meal yourself.
“The ingredients were grouped by recipe in paper bags — a feature I really like as it helps keep your fridge organized and saves you time,” says Healthline Nutrition Editor Kelli McGrane.
“While some of the ingredient proportions were a bit off and the timing of some of the steps could’ve been better, I think this is one of the best meal delivery services thanks to the quality ingredients and flavorful dishes.”

Magic Kitchen is a meal delivery service that provides fully prepared frozen meals tailored to older adults. It offers meals for a variety of dietary patterns, including a wide range of low carb and diabetes-friendly dishes. Our tester, Betty Boler — a relative of a Healthline employee — said she would recommend this service “to those who have limited or no access to transportation for groceries.”
Magic Kitchen also offers meals that fit into more specialized diets, such as renal diets.  Renal diets  are eating patterns that are safe for people with advanced kidney disease who commonly need to limit their intake of certain nutrients, such as potassium and phosphorus.
Many people with diabetes also have kidney disease, so Magic Kitchen may be a good choice for those who have difficulty finding meal delivery services that are safe for specialized diets. For example, in addition to its diabetes-friendly plan, Magic Kitchen offers meals appropriate for people with chronic kidney disease stages 3 and 4 as well as meals suitable for people on dialysis.
Magic Kitchen offers a variety of meal plans, and customers can purchase complete meals, bundle packs, or individual items, including snacks and desserts.
Boler tried out Magic Kitchen’s meals for a week and enjoyed them. “I liked that they were delivered directly to my home. The preparation process was easy,” she said. She also mentioned that the website is easy to navigate, and she had no problems with deliveries. The food showed up “packed in dry ice and [was] very fresh when prepared.”
Most meals on Magic Kitchen’s diabetes-friendly menu contain 20 g to 45 g of carbohydrates per serving and fewer than 700 milligrams (mg) of sodium.
A few examples of the service’s diabetes-friendly meals are:
Balsamic Glazed Chicken with Roasted Potatoes and Green Beans (27 carbs, 280 calories)
Salmon Lemon Dill with Red Rice (42 carbs, 380 calories)
Eggplant Parmigiana and Polenta with Spinach and Roasted Peppers (27 carbs, 370 calories)
Though Boler liked how fresh the food was and how the meal was very tender and good, she said some foods “didn’t have a lot of flavor,” and she “did have to season most of the meals.” Boler also found that some of the vegetables were too soft.
You can also filter the menu to find items that are low fat, gluten-free, dairy-free, low sodium, vegetarian, or suitable for people with kidney disease.

Comparing the best diabetes meal services

How we test meal kits
We know that meal delivery services aren’t a small investment, which is why we’ve taken the time to test more than 30 of the most popular meal delivery services on the market.
Testers select a week’s worth of meals from multiple menus to get a well-rounded view of the types of flavors and ingredients offered.
During testing, we consider several factors, including the ease of the sign-up and meal selection process, the variety and nutritional composition of the meals offered, ingredient quality and freshness, how easy the meals are to cook, and, of course, the taste.
Learn more about  how we test meal kits .
Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate menus and ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the meal delivery services on this page, we considered all the services that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further.  Read more about how we test meal delivery services.
There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. Here are some key facts to keep in mind as well as foods to limit:
Diabetes  affects  your body’s ability to use or produce insulin, a hormone responsible for transporting sugar from the bloodstream to the cells.
In addition to taking medications as prescribed by your doctor, making changes to your diet can help keep your blood sugar levels stable.
If you have diabetes, it’s important to  monitor  your intake of carbohydrates, which are converted into sugar in your body. Also aim to include foods lower in saturated fat, sodium, and added sugars in your meals and snacks.
A doctor or dietitian can provide specific recommendations for the types of foods to prioritize and the appropriate portion sizes, depending on your needs.
Be sure to check with a healthcare professional before making any changes to your diet or lifestyle. They can adjust your medications as needed and offer additional guidance on how to manage your diabetes.

What to look for in diabetes meal services
Nutritional value:  To support healthy blood sugar levels, meals should be low in refined carbs and added sugar and high in fiber, protein, and  healthy fats . It can be helpful to choose a service that offers a menu specifically designed for people with diabetes.
Time commitment:  If you like to cook, you may prefer a  meal kit delivery service , which provides pre-portioned ingredients and easy-to-follow recipes. On the other hand, if you’re short on time, look for a company that delivers  fully prepared meals . In either case, take into account the recommended method of reheating and the time required. Some of our reviewers found it can sometimes take longer to prepare meals than the service says.
Household needs:  Some companies offer meals that feed one person, which is a better choice for people who live alone or are looking for easy lunches. Other services offer meals that feed several people, which tend to suit couples or families.
Dietary needs:  If you follow a specific diet or have any allergies or specific food preferences, it’s important to find a meal delivery service that caters to your needs.
Budget:  The cost of meal delivery services can vary quite a bit, so be sure to consider your budget when finding a service that works for you. Make sure to factor in shipping fees as well.
