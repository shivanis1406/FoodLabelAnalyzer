Meal delivery services can be an easy way to add more variety to your diet while saving time on meal prep.
Prepared meal delivery services are especially convenient. Many offer premade meals delivered directly to your door — no cooking, cutting, or cleaning required.
However, not all prepared meal delivery services are created equal.

Why we love it:  We’ve tested Factor three times, with three separate testers trying different menus. Overall, we think it’s the best prepared meal service thanks to its dietitian-designed meals that can suit a wide range of diets.

We also love that Factor uses fresh, never frozen ingredients to create meals free from hormones, antibiotics, refined sugars, and  GMOs .
Kelli McGrane , MS, RD tried Factor for the first time back in 2021. Since then, she’s tried more than 25 meal delivery services and said that Factor had the best prepared meals. That’s thanks to its satisfying flavors, nutritionally balanced meals, and good variety of options.
McGrane said, “Factor’s meals exceeded my expectations. None of the vegetables were bland or mushy, the proteins were all cooked perfectly, and the flavors were on point.”
Kristin Currin-Sheehan also tried Factor. She lives with fibromyalgia and finds that anti-inflammatory diets, keto diets, and Mediterranean diets are most helpful for her. She also avoids consuming red meat.
Currin-Sheehan was impressed that Factor had a large selection of keto meals, “from keto samplers of shakes and bars to breakfasts and dinners,” in addition to diverse cuisines from across cultures.
The only drawback she found was that she “did not appreciate how Factor would not allow you to order a single meal at a once-monthly price.”
Overall, Currin-Sheehan found Factor way more flavorful and filling than other meal delivery services she has tried and said they had a “much better selection of chicken.”

Why we love it:  Featuring flavorful, single-serve meals and smoothies, Splendid Spoon is a tasty and convenient way to keep your fridge and freezer fully stocked.
We’ve tested the service several times with two different testers. Overall, both enjoyed the noodle bowls and soups, with mixed reviews on the company’s superfood juice shots.
“Unlike many store-bought smoothies, I love Splendid Spoon smoothies because they’re flavorful without being overly sweet. I also like that they contain ingredient combinations that I wouldn’t think to make on my own,” McGrane shared.
She also noted that the Vegan Meatballs & Marinara Noodles is one of her all-time favorite lunch items from a prepared meal delivery service.
Our second tester, Naomi Farr, especially liked the Blue Majik Smoothie, calling the flavor “gentle and satisfying.” However, she commented that the price was “a bit steep” at nearly $10 each.
The Kale & Lentil Soup was also a standout for her. “ It was really good! There was more kale than I thought there would be, but this was delicious. I also liked that there were both red and green lentils in it,” she said. “I ate the whole serving and would gladly buy this one again.”

Why we love it:  For those short on time, Home Chef offers an assortment of oven-ready meals and meal kits appropriate for individuals, couples, and families.
McGrane liked how the oven-ready meals required very little (if any) prep work and even included a disposable baking tray, making cleanup a breeze.
In addition to oven-ready meals, Home Chef also offers microwavable entrees, desserts, breakfast, and Express Meal Kits, which feature prepped and preportioned ingredients for meals that are ready in 30 minutes or less.

Why we love it:  Territory Foods offers an assortment of chef-prepared meals, all of which are made without gluten, dairy, refined sugars, and chemical preservatives.
Candice Abellon  tried Territory Foods and came away satisfied with the look and taste of each dish.
She also praised the service for its good variety of meals to choose from. “The menus available when I tried the service had chicken, beef, and fish options as well as plant-based proteins. There were also filters for ‘low carb’ and ‘keto’ to make them easier to find,” Abellon said.
While all meals are prepared without gluten, note that cross-contamination is possible since they’re prepared in a facility that also processes gluten.
Meals from the local menu should be enjoyed within 5 days of delivery, while those on the shipping menu can last up to 8 days after delivery. All meals are delivered fresh and are never frozen.

Why we love it:  With more than 70 menu options every week, Provenance Meals offers a variety of fresh, nutritionally balanced meals. You can filter by shelf life — “fresh,” “extended fresh,” or “pantry” — if you’re looking for foods that can be stored for a while.
Provenance Meals is a woman-owned prepared meal delivery service that doesn’t require a subscription. Nutrition experts work with the company’s chefs to help formulate menus for each diet plan, with a focus on “simple, wholesome ingredients.”
Olivia Dorsky tested Provenance meals for its “healthy premade gluten-free meals” that are also pre-portioned.
“Provenance has a great variety of meal options that change frequently,” Dorsky said. “There are also options for family-sized sides, which makes this service convenient for a household with multiple people eating these meals.”
Dorsky relied on the “Filter by” section to help her decide which meals to order. At the top of the filtering options, there’s a note that says, “Our entire menu is free of gluten, dairy, and refined sugars.” The filtering options include “ingredients to avoid,” “shelf life,” and “nutrition info.”
Dorsky said that the meals tasted good: “The meals had great seasoning, not needing added salt or other spices. They were not overly salted and were great to eat as is. The portion sizes were reasonably large for a meal delivery service, but for the price, the portion did seem slightly small.”
Dorsky also said that Provenance compares well to other services she has tried: “Though the portion sizes could be larger, the taste is good and the meals feel healthy.”
The only drawback Dorsky found was the flexibility of delivery.
“Something that makes this service less flexible is that the only option was for Sunday delivery, and orders have to be placed by midnight the Thursday before for delivery the following week. Some zip codes allow for Wednesday and Sunday delivery.”

Why we love it:  With its large, fixed menu of nutritious meals designed to accommodate a wide range of health conditions, Magic Kitchen is a  great choice for older adults  and those with certain dietary needs.
Betty Boler tried Magic Kitchen’s Diabetes meal plan for 1 week. She shared, “I really enjoyed the meals. I liked that they were delivered directly to my home.
“The preparation process was easy, and, with the exception of a lack of seasoning, the food was tender, moist, and good. I also like the fact that you could go back and click to rate each meal.
“This product is good for people who have limited or no transportation for grocery shopping.”
You can order meals individually or choose from various bundles, which offer meal packs at a discounted price. You can make a custom subscription by calling the company.

Comparison of the best prepared meal delivery services
Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate menus and ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the meal delivery services on this page, we considered all the services that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further.  Read more about how we test meal delivery services.

How we test meal delivery services
At Healthline, we know that meal delivery services are an investment, so we’ve taken the time to test more than 20 of the most popular prepared meal delivery services on the market. Testers select a week’s worth of meals from multiple menus to get a well-rounded view of the types of flavors and ingredients offered.
During testing, we consider several factors, including the ease of the sign-up and meal selection process, the variety and nutritional composition of the meals offered, ingredient quality and freshness, how easy the meals are to cook, and, of course, the taste. You can learn more about  how we test meal kits .
Here are several factors to consider when selecting a prepared meal delivery service that’s right for you:
Menu selection:  Look for a company that offers a diverse menu with a variety of options to fit your specific food preferences and dietary restrictions.
Ingredient quality:  In addition to freshness, some people may prefer a service that uses organic or sustainably sourced ingredients.
Nutritional quality:  Opt for services that prioritize meals containing lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats, and plenty of vegetables. When possible, try to avoid meals that contain artificial additives or large amounts of sodium or  added sugars .
Cost and availability:  As these services vary greatly in price, be sure to select a service that fits your monthly budget, including shipping. It’s also important to check whether the service is available in your area.

What to look for in a meal delivery service

Other services we tried
Here are some other prepared meal delivery services we tried that ultimately didn’t make the cut.
Daily Harvest  (3.6 out of 5):  This plant-based service is similar to Splendid Spoon in the types of entrees offered: smoothies, grain bowls, soups, etc. While we appreciated the creative ingredient combinations and high quality ingredients, many of the  items we tested  fell flat in terms of texture and satiety power.
Epicured  (4.1 out of 5):  Following a  low FODMAP diet  isn’t easy, so the convenience factor alone makes this service worth considering. Our tester was also pleasantly surprised to find that the service delivered on taste and texture. Just keep in mind that Epicured isn’t cheap.
Mosaic Foods  (3.8 out of 5):  Mosaic Foods is a great option for plant-based diets for vegans and vegetarians alike. The service offers family-size and single-serve portions with menu options that match, but it didn’t make our list because some of the meals were hit-or-miss, according to Healthline contributor Kelli McGrane.
Halal Meal Prep  (3.4 out of 5):  Our tester liked that she didn’t need a subscription to get meals and that she could see the full menu and choose items before purchasing. But this service didn’t make our list because the website was not easy to navigate, and some meals were hit-or-miss.
Trifecta Nutrition  (3.8 out of 5):  While our testers mostly liked Trifecta meals, they had mixed reviews on the textures and flavors.
Veestro   (3.3 out of 5):  This service offers prepared vegan meals. While the shipping was fast and the meals arrived well-packaged, the meals weren’t very flavorful or filling.
