Title: Swiss Chard: Nutrition, Benefits, and How to Cook It

Dark, leafy green vegetables are among the most nutrient-dense foods. The leaves and stalks of Swiss chard, in particular, provide an abundance of vitamins, minerals, and powerful plant compounds.
Although kale is often deemed the king of greens, Swiss chard is equally impressive for its wide array of nutritional benefits.
This article explains everything you need to know about Swiss chard, including its nutrients, health benefits, and potential downsides.

What is Swiss chard?
Swiss chard is a leafy green belonging to the  Chenopodioideae  family, which also includes  beets  and spinach ( 1 ).
Grown worldwide, it’s prized for its ability to grow in poor soils and its low need for water and light.
Although its name may lead you to believe it originated in Switzerland, Swiss chard is actually native to the Mediterranean ( 2 ).
There are many types of Swiss chard, some of which have colorful, jewel-toned stalks and veins that make this vegetable particularly pleasing to the eye.
Just 1 cup (175 grams) of cooked Swiss chard contains ( 3 ):
Calories:  35
Protein:  3.3 grams
Carbs:  7 grams
Fiber:  3.7 grams
Vitamin K:  477% of the Daily Value (DV)
Vitamin A:  60% of the DV
Magnesium:  36% of the DV
Vitamin C:  35% of the DV

As you can see, a small serving of cooked Swiss chard covers your daily need for vitamin K and packs a hearty dose of vitamin A, vitamin C, and  magnesium .
What’s more, Swiss chard is a good source of iron, copper, potassium, calcium, and vitamin E.
This green is not only loaded with nutrients but also extremely  low in calories , so it’s a great option to help you maintain a moderate weight.
Swiss chard is low in calories and high in magnesium, iron, potassium, and vitamins A, C, and K.

Swiss chard health benefits
Swiss chard is high in antioxidants, which protect your body from free radicals that may lead to certain diseases ( 2 ).
Swiss chard’s many  antioxidants  include polyphenols, vitamin C, vitamin E, and carotenoid plant pigments such as beta carotene. These nutrients help protect cells from free radical damage ( 4 ).
Consuming a diet high in the antioxidants found in Swiss chard may decrease your chances of developing certain chronic diseases.
For example, in a review of 18 studies, researchers concluded that people with the highest intake of  beta carotene  had a significantly lower risk of lung cancer than those with the lowest intake ( 5 ).
Swiss chard contains several  flavonoid  antioxidants, including quercetin, kaempferol, rutin, and vitexin.
Kaempferol is a powerful anti-inflammatory compound that may also have  anticancer properties .
For instance, a test-tube study found that kaempferol attacked pancreatic cancer cells by inducing cell death and reducing cancer cell growth ( 6 ).
Research shows that vitexin, another flavonoid found in Swiss chard, may help prevent heart disease by lowering blood pressure, reducing inflammation, and blocking the formation of blood clots ( 7 ).
Swiss chard is high in many antioxidants, including beta carotene and flavonoids, which may help prevent health conditions such as heart disease and lung cancer.
Fiber is an essential nutrient that has many important functions in your body.
For example, it feeds beneficial gut bacteria, promotes regular bowel movements, helps maintain healthy cholesterol levels, and slows digestion to stabilize  blood sugar levels  ( 8 ).
Just 1 cup (175 grams) of cooked Swiss chard provides about 4 grams of  fiber .
Health organizations like the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association generally recommend that adults consume at least 25–30 grams of fiber per day from food ( 9 ,  10 ).
Following a high fiber diet provides many health benefits and could be linked to a lower risk of heart disease and certain types of cancer ( 11 ,  12 ,  13 ,  14 ).
Additionally, some studies indicate that people who follow high fiber diets have significantly  lower body weight  than those on low fiber diets ( 15 ).
Swiss chard is high in fiber, an important nutrient that can help maintain your weight, lower your risk of certain cancers, and promote heart health.
Vitamin K  is a group of fat-soluble compounds, including vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) and vitamin K2 (menaquinone) ( 16 ).
Vitamin K1 , which is mostly found in plant sources, is abundant in Swiss chard.
Just 1 cup (175 grams) of cooked Swiss chard offers 477% of the DV for this important nutrient ( 3 ).
Vitamin K is involved in many important processes in your body.
For example, it’s required for blood clotting and various cellular functions ( 17 ).
It’s also essential for  bone health . In fact, your body needs it to form osteocalcin, a protein involved in bone formation and maintenance ( 18 ).
Low vitamin K intake is associated with an increased risk of  osteoporosis  and fractures. On the other hand, people who consume diets high in vitamin K-rich foods have greater bone mineral density and lower rates of osteoporosis ( 19 ).
Swiss chard is an excellent source of vitamin K, a nutrient essential for proper blood clotting and bone health.
There’s no doubt that eating more fresh produce is good for your heart.
Consuming a diet rich in a wide variety of vegetables and fruits has been shown to lower heart disease risk factors such as  inflammation , high cholesterol, and high blood pressure ( 20 ).
Swiss chard is an excellent source of  potassium  and magnesium, both of which can help maintain healthy  blood pressure levels  ( 21 ).
The fiber found in Swiss chard may lower cholesterol levels by reducing your liver’s cholesterol production and helping your body excrete extra cholesterol before it is absorbed into your bloodstream ( 22 ).
Many large studies indicate that people with a higher intake of green leafy vegetables like Swiss chard have a decreased risk of heart disease.
One study in more than 173,000 people linked every 1-serving increment of leafy green vegetables per day to an 11% reduction in heart disease risk.
What’s more, those with the highest intake — 1.5 servings per day — of leafy greens like Swiss chard were 17% less likely to develop heart disease than those with the lowest intake ( 23 ).
Swiss chard may help lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels, which are risk factors for heart disease.
Swiss chard is loaded with nutrients that may lower blood sugar levels, including fiber.
High fiber foods  help slow down digestion. This reduces the rate at which sugar is absorbed into your bloodstream and therefore helps stabilize blood sugar levels ( 11 ).
Fiber also helps reduce insulin resistance, a condition in which cells stop responding to insulin ( 24 ).
Insulin resistance  is associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and obesity ( 25 ,  26 ).
Some research shows that, in addition to promoting better blood sugar regulation, enjoying more fiber-rich vegetables such as Swiss chard could be linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes ( 27 ).
Plus, Swiss chard is high in antioxidants such as  alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) , which has been shown to reduce insulin resistance and improve diabetes-related complications, including nerve damage ( 28 ).
A review of 23 studies concluded that people with the highest intake of green leafy vegetables had a 13% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those with the lowest intake ( 27 ).
Swiss chard is high in fiber and antioxidants, which may improve blood sugar regulation and lower your risk of diabetes.
Following a healthy diet that includes nutrient-dense foods like Swiss chard may help you lose weight and  keep it off for good .
Filling up on high fiber vegetables like Swiss chard can increase fullness after meals, which could reduce the risk of overeating.
In a 2014 study in 120 adults with overweight, those who consumed more vegetables experienced significantly greater weight loss and hunger satisfaction ( 29 ).
Additionally, people who eat more vegetables tend to weigh less than those who don’t.
For example, one review of 17 studies with more than 560,000 total participants noted that those with the highest intake of vegetables were 17% less likely to have overweight or obesity ( 30 ).
Alongside its fiber content, Swiss chard has only 35 calories per cooked cup (175 grams) ( 3 ).
Adding this low calorie, nutrient-dense green to your diet may be beneficial if you’re trying to maintain a moderate weight.
Swiss chard is high in fiber and low in calories, making it a great addition to a healthy diet for weight loss.

Potential health risks
Though Swiss chard can be a nutritious addition to the diet for most healthy adults, some people may need to limit or moderate their intake.
Here are a few of the potential health risks associated with Swiss chard:
High in vitamin K.  People who take blood thinners, such as warfarin, need to maintain a consistent daily intake of  vitamin K-rich foods  such as Swiss chard Sudden changes in vitamin K consumption can interfere with the effectiveness of these medications ( 31 ).
Contains oxalates.  Like other leafy greens, Swiss chard is high in  oxalates , which play a role in the formation of calcium oxalate kidney stones — but you can still enjoy nutrient-dense foods high in oxalates. To help prevent kidney stones, try to stay hydrated, limit sodium intake, and get enough calcium ( 32 ,  33 ).
May cause allergic reactions.  Though uncommon, allergies to Swiss chard have been reported. If you experience symptoms of a reaction — such as hives, itching, or swelling — after eating Swiss chard, stop eating it and seek medical attention ( 34 ,  35 ).
Swiss chard contains certain nutrients and compounds that some people may need to limit, including vitamin K and dietary oxalates. It may also trigger an allergic reaction for some people.

Swiss chard is available at most supermarkets and can be found in the produce section, often alongside other leafy greens like cabbage,  kale , and spinach.
Here are a few tips to consider when purchasing Swiss chard:
Look for bunches that have brightly colored stalks and smooth leaves.
Avoid purchasing chard with blemishes, discolorations, or brown or yellow patches on the leaves.
Check the stalk to make sure that it’s firm rather than soft, which is a sign that it may be too ripe.
Though buying conventional Swiss chard may be more cost-effective, some people may prefer purchasing  organic  varieties due to concerns about pesticide exposure and long-term effects on health ( 36 ).
