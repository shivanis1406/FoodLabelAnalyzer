Title: Is Brown Rice Good for You?

Brown rice has more nutritional value than white rice. Switching to brown rice may help you maintain a balanced diet while supporting your health goals.
Brown rice  is a food often associated with healthier eating.
Considered a whole grain, brown rice is less processed than white rice, which has had its hull, bran and germ removed during processing ( 1 ).
Brown rice only has the hull (a hard protective covering) removed, leaving the nutrient-packed bran and germ.
As a result, brown rice retains the nutrients that white rice lacks such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
This article will discuss the health benefits of brown rice to help you decide if you want to add it to your diet.

Brown rice is surprisingly nutritious
Although brown rice is a simple food, its nutritional profile is anything but.
Compared to white rice, brown rice has  much more to offer  in terms of nutrients.
Although similar in calories and carbohydrate content, brown rice outshines white rice in nearly every other category.
One cup of cooked long-grain brown rice contains ( 2 ):
Calories:  248
Carbs:  52 grams
Fiber:  3.2 grams
Fat:  2 grams
Protein:  5.5 grams
Thiamin (B1):  30% of the DV
Niacin (B3):  32% of the DV
Pyridoxine (B6):  15% of the DV
Pantothenic acid (B5) : 15% of the DV
Iron:  6% of the DV
Magnesium:  19% of the DV
Phosphorus:  17% of the DV
Zinc:  13% of the DV
Copper:  24% of the DV
Manganese:  86% of the DV
Selenium:  21% of the DV
This whole grain is also a good source of folate, riboflavin (B2), potassium and calcium.
Additionally, brown rice is exceptionally high in manganese. This little-known mineral is vital for many important processes in the body, such as bone development, wound healing, muscle contraction metabolism, nerve function and blood sugar regulation ( 3 ).
A deficiency in manganese has been linked to a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome, bone demineralization, impaired growth and low fertility ( 4 ,  5 ).
Just one cup of rice fulfills nearly all your daily requirement for this important nutrient.
Aside from being an excellent source of vitamins and minerals, brown rice provides powerful plant compounds, as well.
For example, brown rice contains phenols and flavonoids, a class of  antioxidants  that help protect the body from oxidative stress ( 6 ).
Oxidative stress is associated with a number of health conditions, including heart disease, certain types of cancer and premature aging ( 7 ).
The antioxidants found in brown rice help prevent cell injury caused by unstable molecules called free radicals and reduce inflammation in the body ( 8 ).
A 2014 randomized controlled trial study with 40 women concluded that brown rice intake can significantly reduce inflammatory biomarkers- CRP or C-reactive protein ( 9 ).
Older studies suggest that the antioxidants found in rice may be the reason for the low prevalence of certain chronic diseases in areas of the world where rice is a staple food ( 10 ).
Brown rice is highly nutritious, providing the body with a wide array of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.

Is brown rice good for weight loss?
Replacing more refined grains with brown rice may help you  lose weight .
Refined grains like white rice, white pasta and white bread lack the fiber and nutrients that whole grains like brown rice contain.
For example, one cup (158 grams) of brown rice contains 3.5 grams of fiber, while white rice contains less than 1 gram ( 11 ).
Fiber helps keep you fuller over a longer period of time, so choosing fiber-rich foods may help you consume fewer calories overall ( 12 ).
In fact, studies show that people who eat more whole grains like brown rice weigh less than those who consume fewer whole grains.
A 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that whole grain intake including brown rice is associated with a lower risk of weight gain or obesity. Results suggest that whole grains reduce hunger and a desire to eat; keeping you satiated ( 13 ).
In one older study, 40 overweight women who ate 2/3 cup (150 grams) of brown rice per day for six weeks had significant reductions in body weight and waist circumference compared to women who ate the same amount of white rice.
Additionally, the women who ate brown rice experienced a significant decrease in blood pressure and CRP, a marker of inflammation in the body ( 14 ).
Brown rice contains more fiber than refined grains like white rice. Choosing fiber-rich whole grains like brown rice keeps you feeling full and may help you lose weight.

It can benefit heart health
There’s no doubt that brown rice is a  heart-healthy food . It is rich in fiber and beneficial compounds that may help reduce the risk of heart disease.
A 2017 review of 31 studies from 1980-2017 stated higher amounts of dietary fiber resulted in a 10-20% reduction in the risk for developing cardiovascular disease ( 15 ).
Similarly, a review of 45 studies found that people who ate the highest amount of whole grains, including brown rice, had a 21% lower risk of coronary heart disease compared to those who ate the least whole grains ( 16 ).
Aside from being a good source of fiber, brown rice contains compounds called lignans that may help reduce heart disease risk factors.
Diets high in lignan-rich foods, such as whole grains, flax seeds, sesame seeds and nuts, have been associated with reduced cholesterol, lower blood pressure and decreased artery stiffness ( 17 ).
What’s more, brown rice is high in magnesium, a mineral that plays a critical role in keeping the heart healthy. One review of 40 studies found that increasing dietary magnesium was associated with a 7–22% lower risk of stroke, heart failure and all-cause mortality ( 18 ).
Another review of nine studies demonstrated that every 100 mg/day increase in dietary magnesium reduced heart disease mortality in women by 24–25% ( 19 ).
Brown rice is packed with fiber, lignans and magnesium, which all have beneficial effects on heart health and heart disease risk.

It’s a better choice for those with diabetes
Reducing carb intake and choosing healthier options is vital for blood sugar control.
Although carbs have the largest impact on blood sugar, people with diabetes can reduce blood sugar and insulin spikes by eating fewer refined grains like white rice.
Replacing white rice with brown rice may benefit people with diabetes in several ways.
In one study, people with type 2 diabetes who ate two servings of brown rice per day experienced a significant decrease in post-meal blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c (a marker of blood sugar control), compared to those who ate white rice ( 20 ).
Brown rice has a lower glycemic index than white rice, meaning that it’s digested slower and has less of an impact on blood sugar.
Choosing foods with a lower glycemic index can help those with diabetes better control their blood sugar.
Multiple studies suggest that foods with a higher glycemic index increase blood sugar, insulin and ghrelin, a hormone that drives hunger ( 21 ,  22 ).
Reducing ghrelin levels may help people with diabetes control their hunger, which can reduce overeating and help  keep blood sugar in check .
In a 2022 review of studies, replacing just 50 grams of white rice with brown rice per day was associated with a 13% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes ( 23 ).
Choosing brown rice over refined grains can help people with diabetes control their blood sugar and reduce the chances of developing diabetes at all.

Brown rice is naturally gluten-free
Gluten is a protein found in grains like wheat, barley and rye. These days, more and more people are following gluten-free diets for various reasons.
Certain people are allergic or intolerant to gluten and experience mild to severe  reactions  to it like stomach pain, diarrhea, bloating and vomiting.
Additionally, people with certain autoimmune diseases often benefit from a gluten-free diet ( 24 ).
These factors have led to a growing demand for gluten-free foods.
Luckily, brown rice is naturally free of this often problematic protein, making it a safe choice for those who can’t or choose not to consume gluten.
Unlike highly processed gluten-free items, brown rice is a whole grain that is packed with beneficial nutrients that your body needs to function properly.
Brown rice is also combined with other food products like crackers and pasta that people on  gluten-free diets  can enjoy.
Brown rice does not contain gluten and is a safe and healthy choice for those following gluten-free diets.
