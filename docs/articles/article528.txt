Title: Egg White Nutrition Facts

Egg whites are low in calories, carbs, fat, and cholesterol, but high in protein. They provide fewer nutrients compared with whole eggs.
Eggs contain many beneficial nutrients that  may help  improve cognition, blood lipid markers, and body composition.
However, nutrients aren’t evenly distributed between the different parts of an egg, such as the egg yolk and egg white. This means the nutritional value may vary depending on whether you eat the whole egg or just the egg white.
Keep reading to learn more about the nutritional profile of egg whites and how they compare to whole eggs.

Nutrition facts of egg whites and whole eggs
Egg whites are the clear, thick liquid that surrounds the yellow yolk of an egg.
In a fertilized egg, they act as a protective layer to defend a growing chicken from harmful bacteria and provide some nutrients for its growth.
Most of an egg’s vitamins, minerals, and lipids are  found  in the egg yolk, while egg whites comprise around  87%  water and 10% protein.
If you remove the yolk and eat only the egg white, the nutritional value of your egg will change considerably.
The chart below shows the nutritional differences between the  egg white  of a large egg (34 grams [g]) and a  whole, large egg  (50.3 g).
The Daily Values (DV) are presented in percentages (%) and calculated using the DVs from the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) :
An egg white contains fewer calories and micronutrients than  a whole egg , as well as less protein and fat.

Low in calories but high in protein
Research  suggests that proteins in eggs are distributed fairly evenly across the egg’s different parts.
However, egg whites provide a much higher protein-to-calorie ratio than whole eggs, as they’re high in protein and low in calories.
For instance, if you consume the same amount of calories in egg whites as in one whole egg (74 calories), you’d consume nearly 15 g of protein, compared to 6.2 g.
Getting enough protein in your diet is important because it plays  multiple roles  in maintaining the structure, function, and well-being of your organs and muscles.
Research  suggests that eating a high protein diet may provide several benefits for managing body weight and improving body composition, such as:
increasing lean muscle mass
reducing body fat levels
promoting feelings of fullness
reducing hunger
improving gut health
preventing bone loss in older adults
Due to their high protein content, eating egg whites may help you increase your protein intake without significantly affecting your caloric goals.
Egg whites also  provide  a “complete” protein, which means the protein contains all nine  essential amino acids  in the amounts your body needs to function at its best.

Low in fat and free of cholesterol
Eggs have been a  controversial food choice  in the past due to their high  saturated fat  and  cholesterol  content. Some healthcare organizations and researchers suggested it could increase your risk for cardiovascular disease.
All of the cholesterol and fat in eggs are found in the yolk. Egg whites, on the other hand, are almost pure protein and contain no fat or cholesterol.
For years, this meant that eating egg whites was considered healthier than eating whole eggs.  However, studies have  since  shown the benefits of eating  eggs and that the cholesterol in eggs is not a problem for most people.
Nevertheless, for some people — called “ hyper-responders ” — eating cholesterol will raise blood levels.
Hyper-responders have genes,  such as  the APoE4 gene, that predispose them to high cholesterol. For people with this gene or individuals with high cholesterol, egg whites may be a better choice.

Potential risks
Egg whites are usually a safe food choice. However, they do carry some risks.
Though egg whites are safe for most people,  egg allergies  are possible.
Some  research  suggests that many of the allergens associated with egg allergies are found in the egg white.
Children experience egg allergies more often than other age groups, but 1 in 2 children outgrow the condition by the age of 3 years.
Raw eggs  and egg whites also pose a risk of food poisoning from the bacteria Salmonella, according to the  FDA .
Salmonella  may be present in the egg or on the eggshell, though modern farming and cleanliness practices can minimize this risk. Cooking egg whites until solid also significantly reduces your risk for this problem.
Raw egg whites may also reduce the absorption of the water-soluble vitamin  biotin . It’s found in various foods and is important in energy production.
Raw egg whites contain the protein avidin, which can bind to biotin and  stop  its absorption.
However, to cause a biotin deficiency, you have to eat large amounts of raw egg whites. Additionally, once the eggs are cooked, avidin does not have the same effect.

Egg whites vs. whole eggs: Which should you eat?
Egg whites are high in protein yet low in calories, fat, and cholesterol.
This might make them a good food for your diet if you have a low calorie target but want to maintain muscle mass, reduce appetite, and boost energy.
However, compared to whole eggs, egg whites are low in other nutrients.
Whole eggs  are considered one of the most nutritious foods. They  contain  a wide range of vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats that may provide anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anti-oxidative, and immunomodulatory properties, among others.
If you want to benefit from both egg whites and whole eggs, consider adding egg whites to whole eggs to boost the protein content while keeping the calories down.

Frequently asked questions
No, eating two egg whites only provides just over 7 g of protein. The  Dietary Guidelines for Americans  recommends adult males consume at least 56 g of protein daily and adult females 46 g.
Yes, you can eat 10 egg whites daily. However, eating a variety of lean animal and plant-based protein sources may provide your body with a much wider range of nutrients.
Egg whites have historically been deemed healthier than yolks due to their low calorie, fat, and cholesterol content. However, research suggests that egg yolks are healthy and, in fact, contain most of an egg’s vitamins and minerals, among other nutrients.

The bottom line
Egg whites are a high protein, low calorie food. This may be beneficial if you’re trying to maximize your protein intake while keeping your calories down.
However, it’s important to remember that whole eggs provide many more beneficial nutrients.
Consider eating both to maximize the benefits.
