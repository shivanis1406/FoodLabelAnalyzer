Title: 8 Health Benefits of Mint

Mint is a fragrant and delicious plant that is an ingredient in many foods and beverages. It also has health benefits that may include relieving indigestion, improving brain function, and masking bad breath.
Mint is the name for over a dozen plant species, including peppermint and spearmint, that belong to the genus  Mentha .
These plants are particularly known for the cooling sensation they impart. They can be added to foods in both fresh and dried forms.
Mint is a popular ingredient in several foods and beverages, ranging from teas and alcoholic drinks to sauces, salads and desserts.
While eating the plant offers some health benefits, research shows that several of mint’s health benefits come from applying it to the skin, inhaling its aroma or taking it as a capsule.
This article takes a closer look at eight science-based health benefits of mint.

1. Rich in nutrients
While not typically consumed in large quantities, mint does contain a fair amount of nutrients.
In fact, just  2 tablespoons (11.4 grams)  of spearmint contains:
Calories:  5
Fiber:  0.8 grams
Vitamin A:  3% of the  Daily Value (DV)
Iron:  8% of the DV
Manganese:  6% of the DV
Folate:  3% of the DV
Because of its dynamic flavor, mint is often added to recipes in small amounts, so consuming even 2 tablespoons may be difficult. However, it’s possible you may come close to this amount in some salad recipes that include mint among the other ingredients.
Mint is a particularly good source of vitamin A, a  fat-soluble vitamin  that is critical for  eye health  and night vision.
It is also a potent source of antioxidants, especially when compared to other herbs and spices. Antioxidants help protect your body from oxidative stress, a type of damage to cells caused by free radicals.

2. May improve irritable bowel syndrome
Irritable bowel syndrome  (IBS) is a common digestive tract disorder. It is characterized by digestive symptoms like stomach pain, gas, bloating and changes in bowel habits.
Although treatment for IBS often includes dietary changes and taking medications, research shows that taking peppermint oil as an herbal remedy might also be helpful.
Peppermint oil contains a compound called menthol, which is  thought to help alleviate  IBS symptoms through its relaxing effects on the muscles of the digestive tract.
A  2014 review of nine studies  including over 700 patients with IBS found that taking peppermint oil capsules improved IBS symptoms significantly more than placebo capsules.
However, a  2021 study  found that peppermint oil and placebo both showed clinically meaningful improvement in IBS symptoms. However, there were no significant differences between the groups. Further large, rigorous trials are needed to evaluate the role of peppermint oil for the treatment of IBS.
Notably, nearly all research showing IBS symptom relief used oil capsules rather than raw mint leaves.

3. May help relieve indigestion
Mint may also be effective at relieving other digestive problems such as upset stomach and indigestion.
Indigestion may occur when food sits in the stomach for too long before passing into the rest of the digestive tract.
Multiple studies  have shown that food passes through the stomach quicker when people take peppermint oil with meals, which could relieve symptoms from this type of indigestion.
Similar to IBS, studies highlighting mint’s ability to relieve indigestion used peppermint oil rather than fresh or dried leaves.

4. Could improve brain function
In addition to ingesting mint, there are claims that inhaling the aroma of essential oils from the plant could provide health benefits, including  improved brain function .
One  2022 animal study  demonstrated that smelling the aroma of peppermint essential oil produced significant improvements in learning and memory, as well as protecting neurons and reducing damage from brain tiossue oxidation.
Another study in 2015  found that smelling these oils while driving increased alertness and decreased levels of frustration, anxiety and fatigue.
More research is needed to help understand how it may work and investigate whether peppermint does, in fact, improve brain function.

5. May decrease breastfeeding pain
Breastfeeding mothers commonly experience sore and cracked nipples, which can make breastfeeding painful and difficult.
Studies have shown that applying mint to the skin can help relieve pain associated with  breastfeeding .
In these studies, breastfeeding mothers applied various forms of mint to the area around the nipple after each feeding. Typically, they used an essential oil on its own or mixed with gel or water.
One study  showed that only 3.8% of mothers who applied a peppermint gel experienced nipple cracks, compared to 6.9% of those who used lanolin and 22.6% of those who used a placebo.
Furthermore,  an additional study  showed that both the pain and severity of nipple cracks decreased in mothers who applied menthol essential oil after each feeding.
However, a  2022 study  found expressed breast milk to be more effective than peppermint water in relieving cracked nipples, so further research is needed.

6. Subjectively improves cold symptoms
Many over-the-counter cold and flu treatments contain menthol, a primary compound in peppermint oil.
Many people believe menthol is an effective nasal decongestant that can get rid of congestion and improve airflow and breathing.
However, menthol in itself has no decongestant function. That being said,  research  also shows that menthol can subjectively improve nasal breathing.
This means that although menthol doesn’t work as a decongestant, it can make people feel like they are breathing through their nose easier.
This is likely to provide at least some relief to those affected by a cold or the flu.

7. May mask bad breath
Mint-flavored chewing gum and breath mints are some of the first things people reach for when trying to prevent or get rid of bad breath.
According to an older source,  most of these products can mask foul-smelling breath for a few hours. However, they only cover up bad breath and don’t reduce the bacteria or other compounds causing bad breath in the first place.
On the other hand, drinking peppermint tea and chewing on fresh leaves may be able to both mask bad breath and kill bacteria, as  test-tube studies  have highlighted the antibacterial effects of peppermint oil.

8. Easy to add to your diet
You can easily add mint to green salads, desserts, smoothies and even water. Peppermint tea is another popular way to incorporate it into your diet.
However, many of the studies showing the health benefits of mint didn’t involve eating the leaves with food. Instead, mint was taken as a capsule, applied to the skin or inhaled via  aromatherapy .
When using mint for health purposes, it is important to evaluate what you are looking to achieve and how the plant was used in the research for that particular purpose.
The list below should help summarize some of the research discussed above.
Eating fresh or dried leaves:  Used to treat bad breath.
Inhaling essential oils:  May improve brain function and cold symptoms.
Applying it to the skin:  Used to reduce nipple pain from breastfeeding.
Taking capsules with food:  May help treat IBS and indigestion.

The bottom line
Mint makes a delicious and healthy addition to many foods and beverages.
Although mint is easy to add to many dishes, research demonstrating its health benefits has mainly used mint taken in capsules, applied to the skin or inhaled via aromatherapy.
Mint’s health benefits range from improving brain function and digestive symptoms to relieving breastfeeding pain, cold symptoms and even bad breath.
You really can’t go wrong adding some mint to your diet.
