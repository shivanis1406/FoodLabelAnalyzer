Benefits
Horse gram has been associated with several health benefits, including promoting  heart health  and weight loss.
Horse gram is a great source of many key nutrients.
Like other legumes, it’s especially high in protein and  fiber , both of which may support healthy blood sugar levels and decrease appetite ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
It also contains a variety of other essential vitamins and minerals, including iron, phosphorus, and vitamin C ( 1 ).
Iron is involved in oxygen transport and DNA production, while vitamin C plays a central role in  immune function  and skin health ( 5 ,  6 ).
Meanwhile, phosphorus is a crucial component of bones and teeth and necessary for energy production and muscle function ( 7 ).
Horse gram is loaded with fiber and  protein , two important nutrients that play a key role in weight management ( 1 ,  3 ,  4 ).
Interestingly, one review of 28 studies tied increased legume intake to a lower risk of obesity, suggesting that legumes like horse gram may benefit  weight management  ( 8 ).
Although limited human research is available, some animal studies also suggest that horse gram may help support weight loss.
For example, one animal study administered extracts of the leaves and seeds of horse gram to rats on a high fat diet and found it helped protect against weight gain ( 9 ).
Another animal study observed similar findings, reporting that rats that consumed horse gram extract for 5 weeks experienced a significant reduction in body weight ( 10 ).
Plus, another study showed that the intake of horse gram extract reduced both body weight and food intake in rats with obesity ( 11 ).
However, keep in mind that research on horse gram specifically is limited to animal studies that used highly concentrated extracts. More studies are needed to determine how this legume affects humans.
Some studies indicate that horse gram may improve heart health and reduce several  risk factors  for heart disease.
According to a 5-week study in rats with high cholesterol, horse gram extract reduced levels of total  cholesterol , LDL (bad) cholesterol, and triglycerides, high levels of which are associated with an increased risk of heart disease ( 10 ).
Other animal studies show that horse gram and its components may reduce several markers of inflammation, which may contribute to chronic conditions such as heart disease ( 12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ).
What’s more, human research has linked increased legume intake to a lower risk of heart disease ( 16 ).
That said, further human studies are needed.
Horse gram is rich in nutrients, including protein and fiber. Some studies suggest that it may promote weight loss and improve heart health, but more research in humans is needed.

Potential side effects
Although horse gram is highly nutritious and associated with several health benefits, there are a few potential side effects to consider.
First, horse gram contains a specific type of carbohydrate called raffinose oligosaccharides, which may cause gas and  bloating  during digestion, especially when eaten in large amounts ( 1 ,  17 ).
In rare cases, allergic reactions to horse gram have also been reported ( 18 ).
Additionally, horse gram contains antinutrients like  phytic acid , which may inhibit the absorption of certain minerals ( 1 ).
However, cooking, soaking, and sprouting seeds prior to consumption may help significantly decrease the content of phytic acid to improve nutrient absorption ( 19 ).
Horse gram may cause allergic reactions in some people and contains a type of carb that may cause gas and bloating. It also contains phytic acid, although its content can be reduced by cooking, soaking, and sprouting.

How to use horse gram
Horse gram is featured in a variety of dishes, thanks to both its unique flavor and distinct texture.
In fact, horse gram is often used in dishes like  soups , stir-fries, curries, and dals.
Most recipes involve soaking or  sprouting  the seeds before boiling or pressure cooking and adding spices.
The seeds are also sometimes roasted, mixed with other herbs and spices, and ground into a fine powder to be sprinkled over rice.
Horse gram is featured in a variety of recipes. The seeds are typically soaked or sprouted and then boiled, pressure cooked, or roasted.

The bottom line
Horse gram is a nutritious legume that’s often featured in many Southeast Asian dishes.
Although research in humans is lacking, animal studies suggest that horse gram may help support weight loss and improve heart health.
However, it may cause gas and bloating in some people due to a specific type of carb it contains. Also, it contains phytic acid, which can inhibit nutrient absorption. That said, its phytic acid content can be decreased through soaking, sprouting, or cooking the seeds.
Horse gram can be prepared several ways and enjoyed in a variety of recipes, including soups, curries, stir-fries, and more.
