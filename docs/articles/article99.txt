Title: Jennifer Lopez’s Diet: Benefits, Downsides, and More

Many artists swear by a specific nutritional regimen and exercise routine to stay healthy.

How to follow it
Jennifer Lopez’s diet is not a branded diet with a specific set of instructions. Rather, it’s simply what fits her needs and goals.
Therefore, there’s no specified minimum or maximum number of daily calories to eat, nor a detailed macronutrient ratio — that is, the amount of carbs, proteins, and fats to get per day.
That being said, aside from following a “clean” eating pattern, J.Lo seems to stick these rules or habits in her daily routine:
Emphasizing protein.  The artist reportedly includes protein in every meal to promote feelings of fullness.
Snacking   between meals.  Jennifer Lopez’s go-to snacks include fruits, nuts, and vegetables.
Focusing on hydration.  J.Lo is said to drink at least seven glasses of water per day.
Additionally, the artist allows herself to enjoy one  cheat day  per week.
Jennifer Lopez’s diet isn’t a branded diet with specified do’s and don’ts. Rather, the artist follows certain guidelines, which include emphasizing protein, healthy snacking between meals, and proper hydration.

Foods to eat and avoid
Jennifer Lopez doesn’t eliminate food groups from her diet, although she does cut back on certain products.
More specifically, her diet focuses on fresh and organic foods and keeps processed foods to a minimum.
Here’s a list of what J.Lo usually eats:
Protein:  mostly  lean protein sources , such as egg whites, white meat turkey, chicken breast, pork, and grass-fed beef
Fish:  mainly omega-3 fatty acid-rich fish, such as salmon and sea bass
Vegetables:  leafy greens such as kale and spinach and cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower
Complex carbs:  sweet potatoes, brown rice, quinoa, yams, oatmeal, and rice bread
Seeds and nuts:  a handful of nuts a day (types are not specified)
Dairy:  Greek yogurt
Fruits:  mostly berries such as strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries
Healthy fats:  extra-virgin olive oil
Beverages:  water and the occasional decaf coffee
Here’s a list of what J.Lo typically avoids:
Processed foods:  including  processed meats  such as sausage or salami, fast foods, chips, breakfast cereals, and snack bars
Certain vegetables:  mostly carrots and sweet corn, which have higher amounts of naturally occurring sugars
Gluten-containing foods:  bread, pasta, and other gluten-rich foods (Though this isn’t the diet’s primary approach, J.Lo seems to avoid these foods.)
Certain beverages:  caffeinated drinks and alcohol
Though sweets and sugars are not included in the list of foods to avoid, Jennifer Lopez’s diet doesn’t regularly include them. Instead, she relies on sugar-free products when craving sweets.
However, since the diet is not 100% restrictive, she enjoys a cookie or ice cream in moderation every once in a while.
J.Lo fuels up with organic, wholesome foods while limiting processed foods. However, her diet is not 100% restrictive and allows for the occasional treat.

Potential benefits
Jennifer Lopez’s diet may offer some health benefits.
Though the diet is not intended for weight loss, following Jennifer Lopez’s diet may help you lose weight. This is mostly because it emphasizes protein intake while limiting processed and refined foods.
High protein diets  help reduce appetite and body fat and can help increase your metabolism ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
For example, a study in 25 men compared the effects of high protein and normal-protein diets — providing 50% and 14% of the daily energy from protein, respectively — on fullness and appetite-regulating hormones.
The researchers found that the high protein diet increased appetite-regulating hormones by up to 116% and feelings of fullness by 19% compared with the normal protein diet ( 4 ).
On the other hand, high intakes of processed and ultraprocessed foods are associated with an increased risk of obesity ( 5 ).
Processed foods are defined as foods with sugar, salt, and oils added to minimally processed foods. Ultraprocessed foods are multi-ingredient industrial formulations, including packaged and premade frozen meals ( 5 ).
One study involving 15,977 adults linked higher intakes of ultraprocessed foods with excess weight, especially in women ( 6 ).
Jennifer Lopez’s diet may lower inflammatory markers related to noncommunicable chronic diseases (NCD) such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease ( 7 ).
Research suggests that dietary patterns that prioritize vegetables — especially leafy greens —  whole grain cereals , fruits, fish, and olive oil and avoid ultraprocessed foods help reduce inflammation linked to an increased NCD risk ( 7 ,  8 ).
In contrast, high intakes of ultraprocessed foods may increase the risk of high blood pressure, obesity, and cancer ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ).
While the diet is meant to help the artist sustain her demanding lifestyle, it may also promote weight loss and reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases.

Potential downsides
Although following Jennifer Lopez’s diet may provide some health benefits, it also has its drawbacks.
First, because the diet relies primarily on  organic foods , it may be expensive and hard to follow if you’re on a budget.
Second, eliminating processed foods may present a challenge for those who prefer these products due to their convenience or taste.
Third, even though many processed foods are nutritionally poor, there are also many processed products of high nutritional quality. This diet eliminates both options.
Lastly, while the diet restricts processed foods, it still allows artificial sweeteners and sugar-free foods, even though these are highly processed. This may make it confusing or unclear to identify which products are allowed and which aren’t.
Jennifer Lopez’s diet may be too expensive, impractical, or confusing for some people.

Exercise
Besides following a “clean” eating pattern, Jennifer Lopez works out routinely as part of her healthy lifestyle, and her diet is meant to fuel her training sessions.
J.Lo follows a varied fitness routine that includes  high intensity interval training  (HIIT), cardio-filled dance sessions, weightlifting, kickboxing, and circuit training.
The artist typically works out for roughly an hour, four or five times a week. This agrees with the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans for aerobic and weightlifting exercises ( 12 ).
Jennifer Lopez complements her diet with a mix of aerobic and weightlifting workouts.

Should you try it?
Jennifer Lopez’s diet is balanced and promotes the intake of nutrient-rich and wholesome foods.
It includes foods from all food groups and limits  processed foods , which are often high in sugar, sodium, and fats.
Additionally, the diet is not 100% restrictive, as it allows for one cheat day a week and the occasional treat, which possibly makes it more sustainable in the long run.
And because J.Lo’s diet aligns with the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for a healthy eating pattern, it may be associated with improved diet quality, a higher intake of macro- and micronutrients, and a lower risk of obesity and chronic diseases ( 13 ,  14 ).
Therefore, giving Jennifer Lopez’s diet a try may work as a preventive form of nutrition.
Jennifer Lopez’s diet promotes a healthy eating pattern that may be sustainable in the long term.

The bottom line
Jennifer Lopez’s diet focuses on nutrient-dense foods and a minimal intake of processed foods.
It promotes a  healthy eating pattern  that’s associated with higher diet quality and lower risk of certain diseases.
It is sustainable for the long term and may also aid weight loss, especially if accompanied by a varied fitness routine.
