Who it’s best for:  people who want more control over the process of making flavored water
Frozen Garden fusions are blends of 100% fruit and herbs that have been frozen into small pieces to allow you to flavor your water at home.
You simply drop one piece into a glass of water and stir occasionally until it melts in 3–5 minutes.
Each piece makes 12 ounces (oz.) (355 mL) of flavored water that contains only 5 calories, 1 gram of carbs, and no added sugars or artificial ingredients — plus 6% of the Daily Value (DV) for  vitamin C  ( 3 ).
Since the fusions are made from real fruit, they also supply antioxidants, which help prevent inflammation and may reduce your risk of chronic disease ( 4 ,  5 ).
no added sugar or artificial sweeteners
takes up less storage space than premade flavored waters
requires manual stirring to make each beverage
Price:  $
Who it’s best for:  people who want flavored water made with real fruit
Spindrift makes  sparkling water  from real fruit juices and purees. Depending on which flavor you choose, these waters contain small amounts of one or more types of fruit juice.
These ingredients differentiate Spindrift from many other brands, which may use natural flavors but may not identify the specific sources.
Furthermore, Spindrift products are free of added sugars, dyes, and artificial ingredients.
Spindrift is available in several flavors, such as Raspberry Lime, Mango Orange, Pineapple, Grapefruit, and Cucumber.
Depending on the flavor, each 12-oz. (355-mL) can contains 2–17 calories, 0–4 grams of carbs, and up to 10% fruit juice ( 6 ).

Who it’s best for:  people looking for a brand that is environmentally friendly
JUST Water is non-carbonated spring water infused with organic fruit essences.
Fruit essences, also called aromas, are one of many natural flavor substances approved by the Food and Drug Administration. They’re derived by heating  fruit , collecting the resulting vapor, and condensing it for use in foods and beverages ( 7 ).
Each 16.9-oz. (500-mL) carton is free of calories, added sugars, and artificial sweeteners.
Notably, the cartons are made mostly from paper, and the caps are made from sugarcane ( 8 ).
Plus, the cartons are refillable, which may make this brand appealing if you’re looking to avoid single-use plastic water bottles that aren’t designed to be reused ( 9 ).

Who it’s best for:  people looking for a nontraditional, innovative flavored water brand
Drink Simple sparkling waters contain carbonated maple water and juice concentrates.
Maple water is the clear, slightly sweet sap found in maple trees. It’s collected by tapping a spout into a maple tree, which allows the sap to flow out.
Though it can be boiled down into  maple syrup , maple water itself isn’t sticky — in fact, it looks and feels just like regular water.
It’s a natural source of antioxidants and essential minerals, such as manganese, which plays a role in digestion, metabolism, and immune response ( 10 ,   11 ).
Since maple water and juice concentrates contribute some naturally occurring sugars, these flavored waters are not calorie-free. However, they have roughly 70% fewer calories than the same serving of a soft drink ( 12 ).
Each 12-oz. (355-mL) can contains 40 calories, 10 grams of carbs, 40% of the DV for manganese, 4% of the DV for calcium, and 1% of the DV for potassium ( 13 ).

Who it’s best for:  people who want unique flavors made with teas, herbs, and extracts
The company Sound infuses sparkling water with a variety of organic teas, herbs, and fruit extracts to create unique flavor combinations.
These drinks are free of calories, sweeteners, and artificial ingredients. The green and black tea varieties contain 45 mg of caffeine per 12-oz. (355-mL) can, while the ginger and hibiscus tea flavors are caffeine-free ( 14 ).
Though no research has looked at Sound’s products specifically, studies have linked green and black teas to a host of health benefits due to their high concentration of plant compounds called flavonoids ( 15 ).
For example, multiple human studies associate  green tea  with a reduced risk of heart disease ( 16 ,  17 ).

All are calorie-free and contain 4% of the DV for calcium per 8.5-oz. (250-mL) can ( 23 ).

Homemade flavored water
If you’d rather save money and generate less waste, it’s easy to make flavored water at home.
Simply add your favorite sliced fruits and herbs to cold water — the longer you let it sit, the stronger the flavor will be.
Here are some popular flavor combinations:
lemon  and lime
strawberry and cucumber
watermelon and mint
blackberry and  sage
raspberry and orange
The nutritional content of homemade flavored waters varies depending on the recipe. However, homemade flavored waters are typically very low in calories and may supply vitamin C and other water-soluble vitamins from the fresh fruit ( 25 ).
What’s more, they may help reduce your carbon footprint.
An estimated 38 billion plastic water bottles end up in landfills each year in the United States alone. Drinking homemade flavored water from a glass or reusable bottle may help reduce this waste ( 26 ).

How to choose
When choosing flavored waters, there are plenty of options to compare. It’s always a good practice to read the ingredient list and nutrition panel on any packaged product, including flavored waters.
Here are some of the things you may want to consider when deciding which one is right for you:
Added sugar content:  It’s best to limit your intake of added sugar from sources such as cane sugar and  high fructose corn syrup . These offer no nutritional or health benefits and may lead to weight gain and other health issues ( 27 ,  28 ).
Artificial ingredients:  Preservatives, flavorings, dyes, and sweeteners offer no health benefits, and some studies have linked consumption of these substances to obesity and related health conditions. On the other hand, some research suggests that artificial sweeteners may aid weight loss when consumed in place of sugar ( 29 ,  30 ).
Natural flavors:  While these may sound intriguing, most are derived from animal or plant sources, some are highly processed, and companies aren’t required to disclose their sources ( 31 ,  32 ).
If the inclusion of any of these ingredients in commercial flavored waters is a concern for you, you may prefer to make flavored water at home using fresh sliced fruit and water.

Frequently asked questions
The best beverage for hydration and overall health benefit is always regular water. Other beverages, including flavored water, should not replace all your regular water intake.
However, flavored waters that don’t contain unwanted additives or other ingredients can be a good option if you want something a little different.
The healthiest non-carbonated flavored water is one you make yourself at home.
While plenty of brands make flavored waters that can fit into a healthy lifestyle, you can choose all the ingredients when you make flavored water yourself.
All you need to do this is plain water and a natural flavoring agent to infuse it with, such as cucumber, citrus, berries, or fresh herbs.
Most of the companies listed above offer lemon and lime among their basic flavors, making these flavors popular and easy to find.
However, brands introduce new water flavors all the time, such as berry, tropical, citrus, and even tea-infused flavors.

The bottom line
A variety of great flavored waters is available on the market.
The options listed in this article are low in calories or calorie-free and contain no  added sugars  or artificial ingredients.
The next time you’re hankering for a bit of sweetness or fizz, grab one of these drinks instead of a  soda .
