This article explores all you need to know about pork belly, including its nutrition, benefits, and potential downsides.

What is pork belly?
Pork belly is a boneless cut of meat that comes from the underside of a hog’s belly.
Once the butcher has removed the spareribs and loin from the pig, the tender pork belly may be left over. This may explain its lower price at your local meat market.
Because pork belly has a high fat content, it’s best when prepared in any of the following ways:
slow-roasting
oven-roasting
braising
stewing
deep-frying
grilling
smoking
pan-searing
If you want the most tender pork belly, you may opt for a slow, moist cooking method such as braising or stewing.
These cooking methods distinguish pork belly from  bacon , which is pork belly with its skin removed that has been cured, salted, and smoked. Chefs often pan-fry bacon or cook it in the oven.
