Title: 14 Healthy Foods High in Antioxidants

Many nutrient-dense foods are rich in antioxidants, including certain types of berries, nuts, and vegetables. These foods have also been linked to other health benefits and may protect against chronic disease.
Antioxidants  are compounds made in the body and found in food that help defend cells from  free radicals , which can cause  oxidative stress  and increase the chance of developing various chronic diseases.
Eating a diet rich in antioxidants increases blood antioxidant levels to reduce oxidative stress and disease risk.
Here are the top 14 healthy  foods that are high in antioxidants.

1. Dark chocolate
Lucky for chocolate lovers, dark chocolate is nutritious. It has more cocoa than regular chocolate, as well as  more minerals and antioxidants .
Moreover, the antioxidants in cocoa and dark chocolate  have been linked  to impressive health benefits such as decreased inflammation and reduced risk factors for heart disease.

2. Pecans
Pecans are a type of nut native to North America. They are a  good source  of healthy fats and minerals, plus contain a  high amount of antioxidants.
In addition, pecans  can help raise  antioxidant levels in the blood and  may help reduce  cholesterol, which is a risk factor for heart disease.
That said, although pecans are a great  source of healthy fats , they are also high in calories. Therefore, it’s important to moderate your portion sizes, especially if you’re trying to lose weight.

3. Blueberries
Although they are low in calories, blueberries are  packed  with nutrients and antioxidants.
Research  from test-tube and animal studies has shown that the antioxidants in blueberries may delay aging-related decline in brain function by  neutralizing  harmful free radicals, reducing inflammation, and altering the expression of certain genes.
Additionally, the antioxidants in  blueberries , especially anthocyanins,  have been shown  to reduce risk factors for heart disease, and lower both LDL cholesterol levels and blood pressure.
