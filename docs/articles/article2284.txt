Title: The 10 Best Keto Candies

Going on a low carb keto diet likely won’t make your sweet tooth disappear.
This eating pattern restricts your daily carb intake to 20–50 grams to put you in ketosis, a metabolic state in which your body burns fat instead of carbs for energy. This means that most sugary sweets are off-limits.
Fortunately, there are plenty of keto-friendly candy options that can be enjoyed if you follow a keto diet.
Here are our 10 favorite keto candies.

Comparison

How to choose
When choosing a keto candy, the carb count is a key consideration. Generally, people on keto aim to eat no more than 20 to 50 grams of carbs per day ( 6 ).
The best keto-friendly sweeteners include erythritol, allulose, stevia, and monk fruit, all of which appear to have minimal effects on your blood sugar levels.
Despite the low carb content, it’s worth considering that the candies on this list aren’t calorie-free. Eating too much may stall weight loss or contribute to weight gain.
Another thing to keep in mind is that consuming large quantities of foods with  sugar alcohols  in one sitting may cause severe stomach cramps and diarrhea ( 2 ).
You’ll want to choose candies based on your ingredient preferences. For example, if you choose to avoid artificial colorings and sweeteners like sucralose and acesulfame potassium, scan the ingredient labels to ensure your keto candies are free of these additives.
Ultimately, it’s best to enjoy a single serving of keto candies as an occasional treat rather than a regular indulgence.

Are keto candies worth it?
To reach and maintain  ketosis , you must significantly limit your daily carb intake. But this doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy an occasional keto-friendly, sweet treat.
Whether or not keto candies are “worth it” to you depends on several factors.
First, keto candies are typically much more expensive than regular candies. If you’re  on a budget , keto candies may not be the right choice for you.
Plus, even though keto-friendly candies are low in net carbs, most still contain  some  carbs. This means you still need to account for them in your total daily carb allotment.
All that being said, keto-friendly candies can be a good choice for those following a keto diet who are craving a low carb sweet treat and can afford the extra cost.

Will keto candies help me lose weight?
No specific food will help you lose weight.
It’s not helpful to focus on just one component of your diet when trying to drop excess body fat.
Instead, it’s better to concentrate on your overall diet quality, daily calorie intake, and energy expenditure in order to promote healthy, sustainable  weight loss .

Frequently asked questions
Most traditional candies are much too high in carbohydrates to fit into a keto diet.
For example, one  Milky Way bar  contains 37 grams of carbs — that’s more carbs than most people following a keto diet are able to consume in an entire day.
This is why it’s best to choose keto-friendly candies that are sweetened with zero-calorie sweeteners like monk fruit when following a keto diet.
When following any diet, it’s important to consume nutrient-dense, whole foods whenever possible.
It’s common for those following keto diets to eat lower amounts of fiber, which is concentrated in carb-rich foods like fruit, vegetables, beans, and grains. Too little fiber can negatively affect your digestive health and cause issues like  constipation  ( 7 ).
On a keto diet, try to include plenty of low carb, nonstarchy vegetables like spinach, cauliflower, broccoli, zucchini, and asparagus. These are high in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and beneficial plant compounds.
You can have candy when you’re following a keto diet, provided you pick low carb keto-friendly versions.
Read the nutrition labels of candy products to avoid purchasing and consuming treats that are too high in carbs to fit into your keto diet.
Many sugar-free candies are keto-friendly. But it’s always important to  read the nutrition label  to determine how many total and net carbs a product contains to decide if it can fit your dietary needs.
One sugar substitute to limit while on a keto diet is maltitol. Even though it only contains around 2 calories per gram, it can impact your blood sugar levels ( 8 ).
Instead, it’s best to choose candies made with  sweeteners  like erythritol, monk fruit, or stevia.
Many keto-friendly candies are very low in carbs, with some containing zero net carbs per serving.
The carb content does vary, with some keto candies being higher in carbs than others. For this reason, check the ingredient labels when comparing keto candies to ensure your choice fits your daily carb allowance.

The bottom line
You can find keto candies to suit every taste, from chocolates to gummies to hard candies.
Look for candies made with high quality ingredients — like natural sweeteners that won’t spike your blood sugar levels.
It’s best to stick to the recommended serving size, as these candies may still pack calories. Plus, eating too many may upset your stomach.
The keto-friendly candies on this list are great options to enjoy on occasion without derailing your health goals.
