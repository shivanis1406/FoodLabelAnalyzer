Title: The Harmful Effects of Fat Shaming

Research has found that fat shaming leads to psychological distress and is not a motivator for weight loss. In fact, it can do real harm.
Some believe that making people with overweight feel ashamed of their weight or eating habits will motivate them to get healthier.
However, scientific evidence suggests that nothing could be further from the truth.
Instead of motivating people, fat shaming can make people feel terrible about themselves,  causing  them to eat more and gain more weight.
This article tells you everything you need to know about fat shaming and its harmful effects.

What is fat shaming?
Fat shaming involves criticizing and harassing people who have excess weight about their weight or eating habits to make them feel ashamed of themselves.
The belief is that this may motivate people to eat less, exercise more, and lose weight.
Research  shows that much of the discussion on obesity on social media involves fat shaming, which often turns into harassment and cyberbullying — especially against women.
In fact, there are entire online communities where people gather to make fun of people with overweight.
However, stigma and discrimination against people with overweight cause major psychological harm and worsen the problem.
Fat shaming is the act of criticizing and harassing people with overweight about their weight or eating behavior. It’s often justified as a means to motivate people, but research shows that it has the opposite effect.

Causes of excess body weight
Discrimination causes stress and negatively affects people.
In the case of individuals with overweight, this stress  can  drive them to eat more and gain more weight.
In a  study  of 93 women, exposure to weight-stigmatizing information made those who had excess weight — but not those who had a healthy weight — eat more calories and feel less in control of their eating.
In another  study  of 73 women with overweight, those who watched a stigmatizing video ate three times as many  calories  afterward compared with those who watched a non-stigmatizing video.
Numerous other studies  support  that any type of fat shaming causes people with overweight to become stressed, eat more calories, and gain more weight.
Many studies show that weight discrimination — including fat shaming — causes stress and leads people with overweight to eat more calories.

Linked to increased risk of obesity
Many observational studies have looked at weight discrimination and the risk of future  weight gain and obesity .
In one  study  of 6,157 people, participants without obesity who experienced weight discrimination were 2.5 times more likely to develop obesity over the next few years.
The same study found that people with obesity who experienced weight discrimination were 3.2 times more likely to still have obesity.
These findings demonstrate that fat shaming is unlikely to motivate people to  lose weight .
Another  study  of 2,944 people found that weight discrimination was linked to a 6.67 times greater risk of developing obesity.
Many observational studies indicate that weight discrimination is linked to weight gain and a drastic increase in obesity risk.

Harmful effects on people with obesity
The harmful effects of fat shaming go beyond increased weight gain — which is serious enough.
Here are some other harmful effects supported by studies:
Depression:  People who experience discrimination due to weight are at a  higher risk  of depression and other mental issues.
Eating disorders:  Fat shaming is  linked  to an increased risk of eating disorders, such as  binge eating .
Reduced self-esteem:  Fat shaming is  linked  to reduced self-esteem.
Other effects:  By causing stress, weight gain, increased  cortisol levels , and mental problems, weight discrimination may  raise your risk  of various chronic diseases.
Research  is very clear that fat shaming can harm people — both psychologically and physically.
Weight discrimination can cause depression, eating disorders, reduced self-esteem, and an increased risk of various other mental and physical problems.

Risk of suicide
As mentioned above, studies show that weight discrimination is linked to an increased risk of depression.
For instance, one  study  found that those who had experienced weight discrimination were 2.7 times more likely to become depressed.
Numerous  studies  indicate that depression is very common among people who have obesity — especially those with severe obesity.
Depression is one of the top causes of increased suicide risk. In a  study  of 2,436 people, severe obesity was associated with a 21 times greater risk of suicidal behavior and a 12 times greater risk of attempted suicide.
While studies on fat shaming and suicide risk are lacking, it’s possible that the harmful effects of weight discrimination can increase suicide risk.
Depression is one of the top causes of increased suicide risk — and people who have obesity are more likely to have depressed. It’s plausible that weight discrimination may increase suicide risk.

The bottom line
Weight discrimination — including fat shaming — can lead to stress and potentially cause overweight and cause people with obesity to eat more.
This form of bullying may not only cause additional weight gain but is also linked to depression,  eating disorders , reduced self-esteem, and an increased risk of various other mental and physical conditions.
