Title: 12 Possible Benefits of Ginkgo Biloba, Plus Side Effects and Dosage

Ginkgo biloba, also known as “ginkgo,” is rich in antioxidants. It may help reduce inflammation and benefit heart, brain, and eye health. However, scientific research is limited.
Ginkgo biloba, or maidenhair, is a tree native to China that has been grown for thousands of years for a variety of uses. Because it’s the only surviving member of an ancient order of plants, it’s sometimes referred to as a living fossil.
While its leaves and seeds are often used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), modern research primarily focuses on ginkgo extract, which is made from the leaves.
Ginkgo supplements are associated with several health claims and uses, most of which focus on brain function and blood circulation.
Read on for information about the possible benefits of ginkgo biloba.

1. Contains powerful antioxidants
Ginkgo’s  antioxidant content  may be the reason behind many of its health claims.
Ginkgo contains high levels of  flavonoids  and terpenoids, which are compounds known for their strong antioxidant effects.  Antioxidants  combat or neutralize the damaging effects of free radicals.
However, it remains unclear exactly how beneficial the antioxidant properties in ginkgo are.

2. Helps reduce inflammation
Inflammation  is part of the body’s natural response to injury or invasion by a foreign substance.
In the inflammatory response, various components of the immune system are recruited to fight against the foreign invader or heal the injured area.
Some research suggests that ginkgo extract can reduce markers of inflammation in both  human  and  animal cells  in a variety of disease states.
While this data is encouraging, more, larger-scale human studies are needed before drawing concrete conclusions about ginkgo’s role in treating these complex diseases.

3. Improves circulation and heart health
In TCM, ginkgo seeds were used to open “channels” of energy to different organ systems, including the kidneys, liver, brain, and lungs.
Ginkgo’s apparent ability to increase blood flow to various parts of the body may be the origin of many of its supposed benefits.
One  older study from 2008  in people with  heart disease  who supplemented with ginkgo revealed an immediate increase in blood flow to multiple parts of the body. This was attributed to a 12% increase in levels of circulating  nitric oxide , a compound responsible for dilating blood vessels
More research is needed to fully understand how ginkgo affects circulation and heart and brain health.

4. Reduces symptoms of psychiatric disorders and dementia
Research results are inconsistent with regard to whether ginkgo can  reduce anxiety , stress, and symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive decline linked to aging.
Some studies show a marked reduction in the rate of cognitive decline in people with  dementia  using ginkgo, but others fail to replicate this result.
A  2016 review  of 21 studies revealed that, when used in conjunction with conventional medication, ginkgo extract may increase functional capabilities in those with mild  Alzheimer’s disease .
A  2018 review  evaluated four studies and found a significant reduction in a spectrum of symptoms associated with dementia when ginkgo was used for 22 to 24 weeks.
Overall, it’s too soon to definitively state or refute ginkgo’s role in treating dementia, but recent research is beginning to make this piece clearer.

5. Improves brain function and well-being
There’s some speculation that ginkgo may enhance brain function in some individuals.
An  older study from 2002  supports the notion that supplementing with ginkgo may increase mental performance and perceived well-being.
However, a  2012 review of research  on this relationship concluded that supplementing with ginkgo did not result in any measurable improvements in memory, executive function, or attention capacity.
While supplementing with ginkgo may improve mental capability, more studies are needed.

6. Reduces anxiety
A handful of animal studies from  2015  and  2018  have observed reductions in  anxiety symptoms  that may be attributed to the antioxidant content of ginkgo.
While supplementing with ginkgo may reduce anxiety, it’s still too early to draw any definitive conclusions from the available research.

7. Treats depression
A  2018 human study  in 136 older adults also found that ginkgo biloba extract could improve symptoms of depression and reduce levels of S100B, a marker of brain injury, when paired with an antidepressant.
A  2019 study  showed that older adults with post-stroke depression who took ginkgo biloba extract alongside an antidepressant for 8 weeks experienced significant reductions in symptoms of depression compared to taking an antidepressant alone.
Nonetheless, depression is a complex condition that may have a variety of root causes.
More research is needed to better understand the relationship between ginkgo and how it may affect depression in the general population.

8. Supports vision and eye health
Very little research has investigated how ginkgo relates to vision and  eye health .
A  2018 review  showed that people with  glaucoma  who took a ginkgo supplement experienced increased blood flow to the eyes, but this didn’t necessarily translate to better vision.
A  2013 review  of two studies evaluated the effect of ginkgo extract on the progression of age-related macular degeneration. Some participants reported an improvement in vision, but this wasn’t statistically significant across the board.
These results may be related to increased blood flow to the eyes.
It’s unclear if ginkgo would improve vision in those who don’t already have vision impairment and more research is needed to determine whether ginkgo can increase vision capacity or slow the progression of degenerative eye disease.

9. Treats headaches and migraine
Very little research is available on ginkgo’s ability to treat headaches. However, depending on the root cause of the headache, it may help.
For example, it’s well known that ginkgo has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. If a headache or migraine is caused by excessive stress, ginkgo  may be useful .
Additionally, if a headache is related to reduced blood flow or  constricted blood vessels , ginkgo’s ability to dilate blood vessels  may improve  symptoms.
On the contrary,  some migraine headaches  are caused by the excessive dilation of blood vessels. In this situation, ginkgo may have little to no effect.
More research is necessary to understand whether ginkgo might be useful for treating headaches and migraine.

10. Improves asthma and COPD symptoms
Some research  indicates that ginkgo may improve symptoms of asthma and other inflammatory respiratory diseases like  COPD .
This is attributed to the anti-inflammatory compounds in ginkgo, which may allow for reduced inflammation of the airways and increased lung capacity.
One  older 2007 study  of 75 people evaluated the use of ginkgo extract alongside glucocorticosteroid medication therapy for managing  asthma symptoms . The levels of inflammatory compounds in the saliva of those who received ginkgo were significantly lower than those who received traditional medication alone.
More research on this specific application of ginkgo is necessary.

11. Reduces PMS symptoms
Preliminary research indicates that ginkgo may help treat both the physical and psychological symptoms of  premenstrual syndrome (PMS) .
An older 2009 study of 85 college students revealed a  23%  reduction in reported PMS symptoms when consuming ginkgo.
The placebo group in this study also experienced a slight reduction in PMS symptoms, though it was much lower, at around 8.8%.
Further research is necessary to better understand the cause-and-effect relationship between ginkgo and PMS symptoms.

12. Treats sexual dysfunction
Ginkgo may treat issues related to  sexual dysfunction , such as  erectile dysfunction  and  low libido .
Ginkgo  has the ability  to improve blood levels of nitric oxide, which improves circulation via the dilation of blood vessels.
As a result, ginkgo may also be useful for treating various symptoms of sexual dysfunction by improving blood flow to those areas of the body.
Some  2021 research  has investigated using ginkgo to treat sexual dysfunction caused by the use of  antidepressant drugs . Results indicated that ginkgo wasn’t any more effective than a placebo in these cases.
Additionally, there  may be  an interaction between ginkgo and SSRI medications, which could render them less effective.
An  older 2008 study  evaluated the use of ginkgo to increase sexual desire and contentment in women who were concurrently undergoing sexual psychotherapy.
The combination of ginkgo and therapy was effective over a longer term compared with a placebo, but supplementing with ginkgo alone was not.
However, research does not support using ginkgo to treat sexual dysfunction at this time.

Potential side effects
It’s important to talk with a doctor before taking ginkgo.
There are cases in which ginkgo  could cause  serious harm. If you are allergic to products that  contain alkylphenols , you should not take ginkgo, as it can cause an allergic reaction.
Other possible side effects  include :
an upset stomach
constipation
headache
dizziness
palpitations
allergic skin reactions
Ginkgo also has the potential to interact with certain medications. Examples include:
blood thinners  (Warfarin, aspirin)
SSRIs/MAOIs/antidepressants (Prozac, Zoloft)
NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen)

Dosage and supplement forms
Ginkgo biloba is commercially available in the following forms:
capsules
tablets
liquid extracts
dried leaves/tea
Most of the current research  reflects results  using purified ginkgo extract. Do not eat raw ginkgo seeds, as they are poisonous.
There’s no clearly defined maximum dosage, but it’s wise to start with a lower dose and work your way up to ensure tolerance. It’s best to contact a doctor for advice on dosages before taking ginkgo.
As there’s limited research in humans, it’s unclear what a safe dosage would be.

The bottom line
Ginkgo biloba has possible anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacities. It may also help improve circulation.
However, while ginkgo has been used for centuries, scientific research is still limited. Much of the available research is inconsistent or inconclusive, and it’s important to keep that in mind.
As with any herbal supplement, there are risks involved. Ginkgo could lead to serious health complications if you’re allergic or taking certain medications.
If you’re thinking of including ginkgo in your health regimen, be sure to consult a doctor first.
