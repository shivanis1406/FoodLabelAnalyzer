Title: 9 Lowest Calorie Alcoholic Drinks

When choosing a low calorie alcoholic drink, skip drinks mixed with simple sugar. Instead, opt for drinks like a vodka soda, tequila with lime, or rum with diet coke. Read on for six more low calorie options.
If you’re trying to lose weight, decreasing the number of calories you consume from alcohol can be very effective if you choose not to cut out alcohol completely.
In fact, many alcoholic beverages are loaded with calories and added sugar, both of which may  contribute to obesity  and other health problems in the long term.
However, while you should consume alcohol only in moderation as part of a balanced diet, there are many low calorie options you can enjoy without compromising your weight-loss plans.
Here are nine of the lowest calorie alcoholic drinks — along with some helpful variations of these drinks.

1. Vodka soda
A vodka soda is a classic drink made by combining vodka with unflavored  club soda .
With just  133 calories  in a one-drink (255-mL) serving, a vodka soda is one of the lowest-calorie mixed drinks you can order.
You can also add a bit of extra flavor by garnishing your drink with  cucumber  or  mint . Or try mixing in a spritz of  lemon  or lime juice.
Alternatively, you can try swapping the club soda for other types of  sparkling water  to give your drink an easy upgrade.

2. White wine
With just  148 calories  in one glass (180 mL),  white wine  can be a great option for cutting back on your calorie intake.
Plus, there are many different varieties to enjoy — from chardonnay to sauvignon blanc to a sweet riesling.
If you’re feeling creative, try adding  fresh fruit  to your wine or mixing in some sparkling water or club soda to make yourself a refreshing spritzer.

3. Hard seltzer
Hard seltzer can be a refreshing, low calorie alternative to  cocktails ,  beers , and mixed drinks.
Hard seltzer combines  seltzer water  with alcohol that is made from fermented  cane sugar . It’s typically available in several fruity flavors.
Although the exact number of calories varies depending on the specific brand and flavor, a 12-ounce (355-mL) serving of  mango  hard seltzer contains just  99 calories .

4. Tequila with lime
Not only is  tequila  with lime one of the easiest drinks you can make, but it’s also very low in calories.
In fact, a  shot (42 mL) of tequila  with a  lime wedge  has only 99 calories in total.
If drinking  tequila  straight isn’t for you, you can try mixing in some club soda, mint, or  coconut water  to make a low calorie cocktail.

5. Light beer
Compared with regular  beer , light beer often has fewer calories and a lower alcohol content.
This can make it a good choice if you like the taste of beer but are looking to lose weight.
While the  precise number of calories  may vary depending on the brand, a 12-ounce (360-mL) can of light beer usually has about  104 calories .

6. Gin and diet tonic
Gin  and tonic is a popular drink that is traditionally made by pouring gin and tonic water over a glass of ice.
However, you can easily decrease the calorie content of this classic cocktail by swapping regular tonic water for diet  tonic water  — a calorie-free alternative.
A gin and diet tonic with  1 jigger (42 mL) of gin  and  4 ounces (118 mL) of diet tonic water  has about 98 calories in total.
You can lower the calorie content even more by changing the ratio of your drink to include more ice and diet tonic water with less gin.

7. Dry martini
A classic martini consists of gin and vermouth and is typically topped with  olives  or lemon wedges.
To decrease the number of calories, order a dry martini instead, which contains more gin and less vermouth.
A dry martini made with  2.5 ounces (70 mL) of gin  and  0.5 ounces (15 mL) of vermouth  contains 185 calories.
Top it off with a splash of  orange bitters  and a  lemon wedge  for a low calorie, flavorful drink.

8. Paloma
The paloma is a refreshing drink made by serving tequila, lime juice, and  grapefruit juice  or soda over ice.
While most recipes also call for extra sugar, you can decrease the calorie count by  skipping the sugar  or using a  calorie-free sweetener  instead.
To make a low calorie Paloma with just 169 calories, mix  1.5 ounces (42 mL) of tequila  with  6 ounces (186 mL) of grapefruit juice , some ice, and a bit of lime juice.
Optionally, you can add a splash of grapefruit-flavored sparkling water and sprinkle some salt around the rim.

9. Rum and Diet Coke
Also known as a Cuba Libre, rum and Coke is a drink made by pairing white rum with  Coca-Cola .
Switching out the regular Coca-Cola for  Diet Coke  is a simple solution that can help you cut calories.
A 7.5-ounce (225-mL) serving of rum and Diet Coke contains 135 calories, compared to 200 calories in a regular  rum and Coke .

Tips for cutting calories
You can easily decrease the calorie content of your favorite drinks in several ways.
For starters, be sure to make your drinks at home instead of buying premade mixers, which are often  high in sugar and calories .
Instead of using high calorie sugars or  syrups , you can enhance the flavor of your favorite drinks with  fresh herbs  such as:
rosemary
mint
basil
lavender
Additionally, you can opt for low calorie or unsweetened varieties of add-ins like soda or tonic water, which are widely available and often contain few or no calories.
Finally, adjusting the ratio of your ingredients may be beneficial. Try using more ice, sparkling water, or seltzer and less soda or juice in your drink.

The takeaway

To decrease the calorie content, you can also try making mixed drinks at home, choosing low cal or unsweetened mixers, using herbs to add extra flavor, and adjusting the ingredient ratio.
