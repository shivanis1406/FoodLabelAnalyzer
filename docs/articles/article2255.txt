Title: The 11 Best Keto Frozen Meals

On the very high fat, very low carb keto diet, you have to stick to 20–50 grams of carbohydrates per day. Doing so helps you enter ketosis, a metabolic state in which your body primarily burns fat instead of carbs ( 1 ).
Because planning all your meals on this eating plan can be intensive, many people want quick options, such as frozen meals. However, many frozen dishes are high in carbs.
Finding a keto-friendly frozen meal can be tricky, but it’s not impossible if you know where to look.

A note about frozen meals
Sometimes, frozen meals can be a lifesaver thanks to the convenience they provide.
However, it’s a good idea to limit the number of frozen meals you eat. These meals are often highly processed and high in salt, and they have been linked to weight gain and chronic conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes ( 1 ).
Their high salt content may also be an issue for you if you have high blood pressure ( 2 ).
Overall, it’s best to eat frozen meals only occasionally, when you need a quick and convenient option.

However, some options toward the bottom of the list may contain preservatives or lower quality ingredients. We still included them and noted what is highly processed, because these meals tend to be less expensive and more widely available.
Some of these dishes can be ordered online, but many are available at your local grocery store.

If you’re ordering online, Carb-Wise options from Performance Kitchen or keto options from Five One Eight Kitchen are great choices.
Finally, consider food quality and other dietary needs, such as vegetarian or  paleo  options.
