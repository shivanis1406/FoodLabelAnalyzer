Title: The Top 10 Biotin-Rich Foods

Both plant- and animal-based foods can provide dietary biotin. Foods high in biotin can include egg yolks and sweet potatoes.
Biotin is a B vitamin that helps your body convert food into energy.
Also called vitamin H or vitamin B7, it’s important for eye, hair, skin, and brain function. It may also support liver function ( 1 ,  2 ).
Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin, which means that your body doesn’t store it. As a result, you need to consume it regularly to maintain adequate levels ( 3 ).
Biotin deficiency is so rare that there isn’t enough evidence to establish a Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) or Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for it. However, the Daily Value (DV) for biotin is typically around 30 mcg per day ( 4 ).
While biotin is available as a supplement, most people can get all they need by eating a varied diet.
Here are the top 10 biotin-rich foods.

1. Egg yolks
Eggs are full of B vitamins, protein, iron, and phosphorus. The  yolk  is an especially rich source of biotin ( 5 ).
A whole, cooked egg (50 grams) provides approximately 10 mcg of biotin, or approximately 33% of the DV ( 4 ).
You should always cook eggs fully, both to reduce your risk of  Salmonella  poisoning and improve biotin absorption. Egg whites contain a protein called avidin, which can interfere with biotin absorption if eaten raw ( 4 ,  6 ).
Eggs can be  hard-boiled , scrambled, or used to make baked goods like muffins or waffles.
Cooked whole eggs are a good source of biotin due to the yolk, which is rich in several B vitamins.

2. Legumes
Legumes  like peas, beans, and lentils are high in protein, fiber, and numerous micronutrients. Some of the richest sources of biotin in this category are peanuts and soybeans ( 7 ).
A 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of roasted peanuts contains just under 5 mcg of biotin, or 17% of the DV ( 8 ).
One study on the biotin content of popular Japanese foods found 19.3 mcg of biotin — 64% of the DV — in a 3/4-cup (100-gram) serving of  whole soybeans  ( 9 ).
Legumes are typically boiled and used as a base for entrées and salads or incorporated into stir-fries or baked dishes.
Legumes, especially peanuts and soybeans, are a good source of biotin. They’re also high in protein, fiber, and other vitamins and minerals.

3. Nuts and seeds
Nuts and seeds are a good source of fiber, unsaturated fat, and protein. Most also provide biotin, but the amount tends to vary by type ( 10 ).
A 1/4-cup (20-gram) serving of roasted  sunflower seeds  offers 2.6 mcg of biotin, or 10% of the DV, while 1/4 cup (30 grams) of roasted almonds contains 1.5 mcg, or 5% of the DV ( 4 ).
Nuts  and seeds can be enjoyed raw, tossed into salads, mixed into pasta dishes and stir-fries, or blended into homemade nut and seed butters.
Eating a variety of nuts and seeds is a good way to raise your biotin intake. Sunflower seeds and almonds are especially good sources.

4. Liver
Certain  organ meats , especially liver, are high in biotin. This makes sense biologically, as most of your body’s biotin is stored in your liver.
Just 3 ounces (75 grams) of cooked beef liver provides nearly 31 mcg of biotin, or 103% of the DV ( 4 ).
Cooked chicken liver is an even richer source, packing 138 mcg per 3-ounce (75-gram) serving — a whopping 460% of the DV ( 8 ).
Some people  enjoy liver  fried with onions, minced into homemade burger patties, or chopped and cooked to top pasta dishes.
While liver isn’t one of the most popular foods, it’s one of the best sources of biotin. A standard serving of chicken and beef liver each provide over 100% of the DV.

5. Sweet potatoes
Sweet potatoes are full of vitamins, minerals, fiber, and  carotenoid antioxidants . They’re also one of the best vegetable sources of biotin ( 8 ,  11 ).
A 1/2-cup (125-gram) serving of cooked  sweet potatoes  contains 2.4 mcg of biotin, or 8% of the DV ( 4 ).
Sweet potatoes can be baked or microwaved until soft. You can also peel, boil, and mash them or add them to homemade veggie burger patties.
Sweet potatoes are a great vegetable source of biotin, with 1/2 cup (125 grams), cooked, meeting 8% of the DV.

6. Mushrooms
Mushrooms are nutrient-rich fungi that offer several health benefits, including ample biotin. In fact, their high biotin content protects them from parasites and predators in the wild ( 12 ,  13 ).
Approximately 20 caps (120 grams) of canned  button mushrooms  contain 2.6 mcg of biotin, which is nearly 10% of the DV ( 8 ).
A 1-cup (70-gram) serving of chopped, fresh button mushrooms boasts 5.6 mcg, or 19% of the DV ( 8 ).
Canned mushrooms work well over noodles, atop homemade  pizzas , and in sauces and gravies, while fresh mushrooms can also be stuffed and baked, sautéed, or added to salads.
Canned and fresh mushrooms are a good source of biotin and easy to add to numerous dishes.

7. Bananas
Bananas are one of the most popular fruits worldwide. They’re packed with  fiber , carbs, and micronutrients like B vitamins, copper, and potassium ( 14 ).
One small  banana  (105 grams) also provides approximately 0.2 mcg of biotin, or 1% of the DV ( 4 ,  8 ).
They’re most often eaten on their own, but you can also add them to smoothies, spread nut butter on them, or freeze them to make nondairy ice cream.
Bananas are a sweet, nutritious, and popular snack, and they also provide small amounts of biotin.

8. Broccoli
Broccoli  is one of the most nutrient-dense vegetables, as it’s full of fiber, calcium, and vitamins A and C ( 15 ).
It’s also a good source of biotin. Just 1/2 cup (45 gram) of raw, chopped broccoli contains 0.4 mcg, or 1% of the DV ( 4 ,  8 ).
You can  enjoy it raw  with hummus or dip, steamed, roasted with olive oil and seasoning, blended into soups, or sautéed and added to pastas and casseroles.
Broccoli provides small amounts of biotin and is rich in several other nutrients, including calcium and vitamins A and C.

9. Yeast
Both nutritional yeast and brewer’s yeast provide biotin, but specific amounts vary by brand.
Brewer’s yeast, also called dry active yeast, is used to brew beer and leaven bread. Conversely,  nutritional yeast  is an inactive yeast that’s often used to make nondairy cheese.
Nutritional yeast may contain up to 21 mcg of biotin, or 69% of the DV, per 2 tablespoons (16 grams) ( 16 ).
On the other hand, a standard 2.25-teaspoon (7-gram) packet of  active dry yeast  used for baking provides 1.4 mcg of biotin, or 5% of the DV ( 8 ).
Nutritional and active dry yeast, which are used as a food flavoring and in baking, respectively, are both good sources of biotin.

10. Avocados
Avocados are best known as a good source of folate and unsaturated fats, but they’re also rich in biotin ( 17 ).
A medium  avocado  (200 grams) contains at least 1.85 mcg of biotin, or 6% of the DV ( 8 ).
Avocados can be eaten raw, mashed onto toast, stirred into guacamole, and sliced to top  salads , taco soup, and burritos.
Avocados, which are commonly used to make guacamole, are particularly rich in healthy fats, as well as biotin.

The bottom line
Biotin is a water-soluble  B vitamin  that your body needs to obtain from food. Deficiency is rare and can be avoided by eating biotin-rich foods.
Some of the best sources of biotin include legumes, egg yolks, organ meats, nuts, seeds, mushrooms, avocados, sweet potatoes, and yeast.
Biotin supplements are available as well, but most people can get all of the biotin they need by  eating a balanced diet .
