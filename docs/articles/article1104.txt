Title: The 15 Best Supplements to Boost Your Immune System Right Now

Deficiencies in certain vitamins, including vitamin C, zinc, and others, may weaken your immune system. Taking supplements of these vitamins may help support immune system function.
No supplement will cure or prevent disease.
With the 2019  COVID-19  pandemic, it’s especially important to understand that no supplement or diet can protect against COVID-19.
Physical distancing, also known as social distancing, and proper hygiene practices may help protect you from COVID-19.
Your immune system consists of a complex collection of cells, processes, and chemicals that  defend your body  against invading pathogens, including viruses, toxins, and bacteria.
Keeping your immune system healthy is key to preventing infection and disease.
Some research suggests supplementing with certain vitamins, minerals, and herbs may help boost your immune system.
However, it’s important to speak with a healthcare professional before trying a new supplement, as some supplements may interact with medications.
Here are 15 supplements that are known for their immune-boosting potential.

1. Vitamin D
Vitamin D is a fat-soluble nutrient essential to the health and functioning of your immune system.
Vitamin D  enhances  the pathogen-fighting effects of monocytes and macrophages — white blood cells that are important parts of your immune defense — and decreases inflammation, which helps promote immune response.
Many people are  deficient in this important vitamin , which may negatively affect immune function.
Vitamin D deficiency may be associated with an increased risk of several conditions,  such as :
osteoporosis
some types of cancer
type 2 diabetes
cardiovascular disease
depression
Research suggests that supplementing with vitamin D may help improve immune response.
For example, a  2019 review  found that  supplementing with vitamin D  significantly decreased the risk of respiratory infections in people deficient in this vitamin and lowered infection risk in those with adequate vitamin D levels.
Vitamin D has also been researched in connection with COVID-19 because of its effect on the immune system. It may  help expedite  healing and stall inflammation in the respiratory system.
However, more research is needed to fully support its effects in the treatment of COVID-19.
The recommended daily intake of vitamin D is  15 micrograms (600 IU)  for adults. However, it’s best to speak with a healthcare professional. They could help determine the best amount for you.

2. Zinc
Zinc  is a mineral commonly added to supplements and other healthcare products.
It’s  essential  for immune system function because it helps:
immune cell development and communication
reduce inflammation
protect tissue barriers in the body
prevent foreign pathogens from entering
Zinc deficiency may affect your immune system’s ability to function properly, resulting in an  increased  risk of infection and disease, including pneumonia.
Zinc deficiency affects around  2 billion people  worldwide and up to 30% of older adults.
Research suggests that  zinc supplements  may be beneficial for people who are already sick. For example, it could  help reduce  the duration of the common cold.
Taking zinc long-term is typically safe for healthy adults, as long as the daily dose is under the set upper limit of  40 milligrams (mg)  of elemental zinc per day.
Excessive doses may interfere with copper and iron absorption, which could increase your infection risk.

3. Vitamin C
Vitamin C is perhaps the most popular supplement for protecting against infection due to its important role in immune health.
This vitamin  supports the function  of various immune cells and enhances their ability to protect against infection. It may also help:
promote cellular death by clearing out old cells and replacing them with new ones
function as an antioxidant and protect against oxidative stress
reduce the duration and severity of upper respiratory tract infections, including the  common cold
Additionally, high dose intravenous vitamin C treatment may help improve symptoms in people with severe infections,  including  sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) resulting from viral infections.
That said,  more research  is needed to fully support the role of vitamin C supplementation in this setting.
The upper limit for vitamin C is  2,000 mg . Supplemental daily doses are typically between 250 and 1,000 mg.

4. Elderberry
Black elderberry (Sambucus nigra), which has long been used to treat infections, is being researched for its effects on immune health.
Animal studies  suggest  elderberry  extract may have antiviral potential against pathogens responsible for upper respiratory tract infections and strains of the influenza virus.
A  2018 review  found that elderberry supplements may help reduce  upper respiratory symptoms  caused by viral infections. Similarly, a  2021 review  noted that elderberry may help reduce the duration and severity of colds.
Some people recommend using elderberry supplements only in the early stages of COVID-19. However,  no research  has evaluated the use of elderberry for COVID-19.
Raw elderberries  should be  cooked before consumption. This helps destroy sambunigrin, a compound found in elderberries that may cause cyanide poisoning.
Speak with a healthcare professional before taking elderberry supplements.
Elderberry supplements are most often sold in liquid or capsule form.

5. Medicinal mushrooms
Medicinal mushrooms have been used since ancient times to help prevent and treat infection and disease.
Research suggests that many types of medicinal mushrooms may  help boost  the immune system.
For example, a  2017 study  in mice with tuberculosis found that treatment with  cordyceps  helped reduce bacterial load in the lungs, enhance immune response, and reduce inflammation.
Similarly, a  2019 study  in 79 adults found that supplementing with 1.7 grams (g) of cordyceps mycelium culture extract led to a 38% increase in the activity of natural killer (NK) cells, a type of white blood cell that protects against infection.
Turkey tail  is another medicinal mushroom that  may enhance  immune response, especially in people with certain types of cancer.
Medicinal mushroom products can be found in the form of tinctures, teas, and supplements.

Other supplements with immune-boosting potential
A wide range of other supplements may help improve your immune system.
However, it’s important to note that more research is needed to support their full effects. Speak with a healthcare professional before taking any new supplements.
Astragalus  is an herb commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).
Animal research  suggests its extract may significantly improve immune-related responses.
Selenium is an essential mineral for immune health.
Animal research demonstrates that selenium supplements may enhance antiviral defense against influenza strains, including  H1N1  and  H9N2 .
Garlic  has powerful anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunomodulating properties.
Research  suggests it may help enhance immune health by stimulating and enhancing certain cytokines.
This herb contains andrographolide, a terpenoid compound that may have antiviral effects against several respiratory disease-causing viruses. It works by stimulating different types of cells,  such as  cytokine T cells and natural killer cells.
Licorice contains many substances, including glycyrrhizin, that may help protect against viral infections.
Research  suggests glycyrrhizin has several anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and immune-boosting properties that could help protect against several illnesses, such as:
hepatitis A, B, and C viruses
vesicular stomatitis virus
herpes simplex virus
influenza A
respiratory-syndrome–related coronavirus (SARS-CoV)
respiratory syncytial virus
vaccinia virus
arboviruses
Some  human research  supports the use of this African geranium extract to help alleviate symptoms of acute viral respiratory infections, including the common cold and bronchitis.
Still, results are mixed, and more research is needed.
B vitamins, including B12 and B6, are important for a healthy immune response.
Yet, many adults are  deficient  in them, which may negatively affect immune health.
Curcumin is the main active compound in turmeric. It has powerful anti-inflammatory properties, and animal studies indicate that it may  help improve  immune function.
Echinacea  is a genus of plants in the daisy family.
Certain species have been shown to  improve  immune health and may protect against upper respiratory tract infections, though research is mixed.
Propolis is a resin-like material honeybees produce for use as a sealant in hives.
Though it has impressive  immune-enhancing effects  and may have antiviral properties as well, more human research is needed.
