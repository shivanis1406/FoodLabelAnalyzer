Title: What Is the Gerson Therapy, and Does It Fight Cancer?

The Gerson Therapy is a nutritional system that involves a specialized diet, raw juices, detoxification, and supplements. Some people believe it may help prevent or treat cancer.
Aside from conventional cancer treatments, there are some natural and alternative therapies, like Gerson Therapy, that some people believe to be an effective way to prevent or treat cancer.
However, many experts question the safety and efficacy of the Gerson Therapy.
This article provides a detailed overview of the Gerson Therapy and tells you whether it’s an effective way to treat cancer and other chronic diseases.

What is the Gerson Therapy?
The Gerson Therapy — also called the Gerson Therapy diet — is a natural alternative treatment system that claims to “activate the body’s extraordinary ability to heal itself.”
It was developed in the  early 1900s  by Dr. Max B. Gerson, who used it to relieve his migraine. Later, Gerson used this therapy to treat diseases like tuberculosis and cancer.
Gerson believed that cancers and other chronic diseases are the result of changes in your metabolism that happen when toxic substances accumulate in your body. The Gerson Therapy aims to restore your health by removing toxins and increasing immunity.
In 1978, his daughter Charlotte Gerson established the Gerson Institute, a nonprofit organization that provides education and training in the Gerson Therapy.
Gerson practitioners are medical doctors or people with a medical, clinical, or naturopathic background who have successfully completed the Gerson practitioner training program.
The Gerson Therapy has  three major components :
diet
detoxification
supplements
People on the therapy must follow an  organic , plant-based diet with raw juices, use coffee enemas several times daily for detoxification, and take a wide variety of supplements.
Before starting the Gerson Therapy, you must apply on their  website  — by submitting medical records, then undergoing a case evaluation — to see if you are eligible.
Although this therapy is meant to treat a wide range of chronic diseases, the Institute mentions that  certain conditions  do not respond well to the Gerson Therapy. These include:
colon removal
ileostomy
kidney failure
chronic kidney disease
dialysis
allogeneic  stem cell transplantation
It is important to note that the Gerson Therapy has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for cancer or other conditions.

How does the Gerson Therapy work?
The Gerson Therapy is divided into three key components — diet, supplements, and detoxification.
The Gerson Therapy diet is entirely  vegetarian  and extremely low in sodium, fats, and proteins, as Dr. Gerson believed that this type of diet helps treat diseases.
Anyone on this diet is asked to consume approximately  15–20 pounds  (7–9 kg) of organic produce per day. This is said to help “flood the body with nutrients.”
Most of that produce is used to make  raw juices . Dieters are asked to drink up to one 8-ounce (240-ml) glass of raw juice per hour — up to 13 times per day.
Juices must be made using a Gerson-recommended two-step juicer that first grinds the vegetables into a pulp, then extracts the juice by squeezing it under high pressure.
The Gerson Institute claims that its approved appliances provide  25 to 50%  more juice than other juicers — and that its drinks are up to 50 times higher in certain nutrients.
However, these claims have not been validated by a third party.
Because the diet is loaded with nutrients, its supplements are not meant to provide more nutrients. Instead, they’re intended to support your cells’ metabolic processes.
These supplements  include :
potassium
pancreatic enzymes
Lugol’s solution (potassium iodide and iodide in water)
a thyroid hormone supplement
vitamins B3 and B12
Potassium supplements are a key part of the Gerson Therapy. Dr. Gerson believed that diseased cells contained too much sodium and too little potassium.
Once his participants started the Gerson Therapy diet — which is high in potassium and  low in sodium  — their cells would reportedly shrink, which Gerson believed to be a sign of recovery.
According to the Gerson Institute, the combined effect of the diet and supplements releases toxins from your body’s tissues. Thus, your liver — which is the main organ that processes toxins — would be working harder than usual.
To support your liver, the Gerson Therapy incorporates  coffee enemas  that allegedly widen your liver’s bile duct so that it easily releases toxins.
The bile duct is a small tube that helps carry bile — a fluid that helps break down fatty acids and many waste products — from your liver to your intestines.
However, no scientific studies indicate that coffee enemas can widen your bile duct. What’s more, evidence is lacking that this therapy causes toxins to be released from your cells at all.
One  review from 2020  notes that the researchers do not recommend coffee enemas as an alternative therapy due to the lack of evidence on their effectiveness and safety.

Can it help treat cancer?
Although almost no scientific evidence supports the Gerson Therapy’s claims, a few case studies have examined its relationship to cancer treatment.
Older resea rch  into the efficacy of the Gerson Therapy found little evidence to support the claims that the therapy can help treat cancer.
The  National Cancer Institue (NCI)  also states that there is limited scientific evidence to support the claims from the Gerson Institute on the treatment of cancer through the Gerson Therapy. They also note that the FDA has not approved the Gerson Therapy for the treatment of cancer or any other condition.
The NCI recommends that you speak with your healthcare professional about nutritional needs during cancer treatment.
Other organizations, such as  Cancer Research UK  and the  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , also state that there is little to no evidence to show that the Gerson Therapy can treat cancer.

Foods to avoid
The Gerson Therapy bans foods that are high in protein, sodium, and fat. Additionally, you cannot eat foods with certain compounds that the Institute claims interfere with the healing process.
Foods in the Gerson Therapy should be prepared  without :
salt
spices
oils
aluminum cooking utensils or pans
Spices and fruit — such as pineapples and berries — are  often prohibited  because they contain aromatic acids, a plant compound. Dr. Gerson believed that aromatic acids interfered with the healing process. However, this is currently determined on a case-by-case basis.

Foods to eat
The Gerson Therapy mandates an organic, plant-based diet. You may be encouraged to consume:
Fruits:  all  fresh fruits  except berries and pineapple, which harbor aromatic acids
Dried fruits (stewed or pre-soaked only):  peaches, dates, figs, apricots, prunes, and raisins — all unsulphured
Vegetables:  all except mushrooms, hot peppers, carrot greens, radish greens, mustard greens, and raw spinach (cooked spinach is fine)
Lentils:  allowed only at certain times if you’re in good health
Grains:  rye bread (unsalted, non-fat), brown rice (if prescribed), and oatmeal
Dairy:  only non-fat, plain, organic yogurt — and only after six weeks
Spices (in small amounts):  allspice, anise, bay leaves, coriander, dill, fennel, mace, marjoram, rosemary, sage, saffron, sorrel, summer savory, thyme, and tarragon
Condiments:  vinegar — either wine or apple cider
Fats:  flaxseed oil — only if prescribed
Beverages:  freshly pressed juices (as prescribed), caffeine-free herbal teas
In addition to the above foods, certain items are permitted occasionally:
Bananas:  typically half a  banana  per week
Breads:  only whole wheat rye (unsalted, non-fat) — generally 1–2 slices per day
Quinoa:  usually once a week
Yams and sweet potatoes:  typically once a week (regular potatoes are unrestricted)
Popcorn:  air-popped, usually as a holiday treat only — a few times per year
Sweeteners:  maple syrup (grade A dark color — formerly grade B), honey, brown sugar, or unrefined blackstrap molasses — 1–2 teaspoons (15–30 ml) of any per day, maximum
The Gerson Institute  states that  individuals are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine the proper diet and whether the program may be right for them.

Potential health benefits
Although no comprehensive studies exist on the health attributes of the Gerson Therapy, it may provide some benefits — largely thanks to its nutrient-rich, plant-based diet.
Here are some potential benefits of the Gerson Therapy:
Higher in many nutrients.  Plant-based diets tend to provide more fiber,  antioxidants , vitamins, and minerals than typical Western diets high in processed foods.
May reduce your risk of heart disease.  Diets high in fruits, vegetables, and fiber have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease.
May improve kidney function.  Plant-based diets may protect against kidney disease and kidney stones.
May reduce arthritis pain.  Plant-based diets have also been linked to reduced arthritis symptoms, such as joint pain, swelling, and morning stiffness.
May help relieve constipation.  The Gerson Therapy and other plant-based diets are high in fiber, which may help relieve constipation and  keep your digestive system healthy .
While there is no scientific evidence to support this, the  Gerson Institute states  that they have had success in treating the following conditions:
breast cancer
ovarian cancer
rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
lymphoma
melanoma
infertility
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

Potential downsides and health risks
The Gerson Therapy has several serious risks and downsides.
These risks  include :
flu-like symptoms
foul odor with perspiration
loss of appetite
fever
tumor pain
cold sores or fever blisters
dizziness or weakness
diarrhea, vomiting, or intestinal cramping
Coffee enemas can also lead to electrolyte imbalance. This imbalance can cause serious issues like dehydration, infections, and seizures.
It’s advisable to discuss proper treatment with your healthcare professional before committing to this diet. Using unapproved alternative treatment methods can lead to dangerous side effects and may worsen your health.

The bottom line
The Gerson Therapy is an organic, plant-based diet that claims to treat chronic diseases like cancer through supplements and detoxification.
However, no high quality studies support its benefits. What’s more, it may pose serious health risks, leading most health experts to discourage the Gerson Therapy — especially for treating cancer.
It is important for you to speak with your healthcare professional before beginning any specialty diets or alternative treatments, especially during cancer treatment.
