Title: What Are 30-Day No Sugar Challenges? All You Need To Know

Reducing your intake of added sugar over time can benefit your overall health, including helping you maintain a moderate weight and healthy blood sugar levels.
Excessive sugar consumption is  linked  to an increased risk of certain health conditions, including  type 2 diabetes  and  heart disease .
Some people take part in “no sugar” challenges to reduce their intake. Many types of 30-day no sugar challenges exist, but most have similar guidelines.

How do they work?
The main goal is to  cut out  all sources of  added sugar  for 30 days. Instead, you focus on consuming nutrient-dense  whole foods . Natural sugars, which are found in foods like vegetables, fruits, and dairy products, are OK to eat.
Rules and recommendations may differ by program. Alternatively, you can easily create your own 30-day no sugar challenge using the information in this article.

Do they have benefits?
Any dietary pattern that decreases or cuts out added sugar is likely to  reduce obesity  and benefit health, especially among people who regularly consume high amounts of added sugar.
However, the most important factor in any dietary pattern is consistency, which isn’t necessarily the point of a 30-day no sugar challenge.
If you cut out added sugar for 30 days only to return to a diet that’s high in added sugar, the benefits of the challenge will be lost.
The following benefits are related to reducing added sugar in general.
Frequently eating foods and drinking beverages high in added sugar harms blood sugar management and may increase your risk of  type 2 diabetes , according to some  research .
Sweetened foods and drinks, such as  soda , candy, and  energy drinks , contain rapidly absorbable sugars, such as  high fructose corn syrup .  Some  research  has linked diets high in these types of sugar to  insulin resistance .
This may lead to elevated blood sugar and  insulin levels , which can eventually cause cell damage and increase your risk of several diseases, including:
retinopathy
dementia
chronic kidney disease
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
polycystic ovary syndrome
cardiovascular disease
Cutting back on added sugar is a good way to reduce blood sugar and insulin levels, even if you only do so for a short time period.
Foods and beverages with a lot of added sugar tend to be high in calories and low in  filling nutrients  like protein and fiber. Thus, a diet high in sugary foods has been linked to  weight gain ,  obesity , and other chronic diseases.
Cutting out sources of added sugar may help you  lose weight , especially when paired with a  nutrient-dense  diet.
Added sugar intake from sweetened beverages is strongly linked to an  increased risk of cavities  and tooth decay. This is because  bacteria in the mouth  break down sugar and produce acid that may damage your teeth.
Thus, cutting out added sugar can  protect your teeth .
High sugar diets, especially high fructose diets, can  increase  the risk of developing  NAFLD , a condition characterized by fat buildup in the liver.
A  2021 study  in 29 adolescent boys with NAFLD showed that eight weeks of a low sugar diet resulted in a 10.5 percent reduction in hepatic de novo lipogenesis, the process that makes fatty acids in your liver.
It also found greater decreases in hepatic fat and fasting insulin compared to the group that followed the usual diet.
Cutting out sugar, especially foods and beverages sweetened with high fructose corn syrup, can reduce liver fat and improve  liver health .
Sugar-sweetened beverages are  linked  to heart disease risk factors, including:
high blood pressure
increased triglycerides
high cholesterol
Studies  also show that consuming too much added sugar is linked to an increased risk of heart disease and heart disease mortality.
Research  suggests that diets high in added sugar may be linked to  anxiety  and  depressive symptoms , and decreasing sugar intake may help reduce these symptoms.
Cutting out added sugar may also enhance  skin health . Studies have linked high added sugar consumption to accelerated  skin aging .
While foods high in sugar may give you a quick burst of energy, a sugar high is only temporary and will lead to a subsequent crash. Therefore, diets that  prioritize complex carbs , like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, can help you sustain energy levels.

Foods to eat and foods to avoid
2020–2025 Dietary Guideline for Americans  recommends limiting added sugars to no more than 10 percent of total daily calories.
The  American Heart Association  also recommends limiting your daily added sugar intake to no more than 36 g (9 teaspoons) for men and 25 g (6 teaspoons) for women. These can be used as guidelines for a diet low in added sugars.
While following a 30-day no sugar challenge, people are encouraged to restrict  foods and beverages  high in  added sugars , including:
Sweeteners:  table sugar,  honey ,  maple syrup ,  corn syrup ,  agave ,  coconut sugar
Sweetened beverages:  soda, sweetened smoothies and juices,  sweetened coffee drinks ,  sports drinks
Condiments with added sugar:   ketchup , BBQ sauce, honey mustard,  coffee creame r
Sweetened dairy products:  flavored  yogurt ,  ice cream , chocolate milk
Sugary baked goods:  cookies, cakes, donuts,  bread  with added sugar
Sugary breakfast foods:  sugar-sweetened  cereals ,  bars , granola, flavored  oatmeal
Candy:  chocolate , gummy  candies , caramels
Sugary alcoholic beverages:  mixed drinks, sweetened liquor, sweetened canned  alcoholic drinks
Additionally, most challenges recommend forgoing artificial and naturally derived low or no-calorie  sweeteners  such as:
Splenda
Equal
Stevia
monk fruit
It’s also recommended that  refined grains , including white bread, pasta, and rice, be minimized and replaced with whole grain products without added sugars.
During 30-day no sugar challenges, participants are encouraged to fill up on  whole , nutrient-dense foods, including:
Vegetables:   broccoli ,  cauliflower ,  spinach ,  carrots ,  asparagus ,  zucchini ,  sweet potatoes
Fruits:   apples ,  oranges ,  berries ,  grapes ,  cherries ,  grapefruit
Proteins:   chicken ,  fish ,  beef ,  tofu ,  eggs
Healthy fat sources:   egg yolks ,  avocados ,  nuts ,  seeds ,  olive oil , unsweetened yogurt
Complex carb sources:   beans ,  quinoa , sweet potatoes,  butternut squash ,  brown rice
Unsweetened beverages:   water ,  sparkling water ,  unsweetened coffee ,  tea
This list is by no means comprehensive, but it can give you a good idea of where to start.

Are there downsides?
Reducing your added sugar intake has no adverse physical health effects as long as you do so responsibly. Make  balanced eating  choices for the duration of the 30-day challenge.
However, like any restrictive dietary pattern, some people may find that they develop an  unhealthy preoccupation  with healthy food or harmful food rules around foods they used to enjoy after participating in this type of challenge. People with  disordered eating  tendencies may be more likely to experience this.
If you’re thinking of trying this challenge, or making any change to your existing eating habits, you may consider working with a registered dietitian. They can help you eat balanced meals and offer education, support, and guidance.

Takeaway
If you decide to participate in a 30-day no sugar challenge, use it to discover which foods or beverages contribute most to your total added sugar intake. This can help you cut back on those sources when the 30-day challenge is over.
After the challenge, try not to focus on giving up all sources of added sugar for good. Instead, attempt to transition to a diet low in added sugars and high in  healthy foods  that you can follow long term.
This is much more powerful when it comes to overall health than any 30-day challenge could ever be.
