What is tahini?
Tahini is a paste made from ground sesame seeds.
Considered a staple of  Mediterranean cuisine , tahini is often featured in traditional Asian, Middle Eastern, and African dishes as well.
It’s an incredibly versatile ingredient and can be served as a dip, spread, or condiment.
It typically has a smooth texture similar to nut butter but a stronger, more savory taste that’s often described as bitter.
In addition to providing a wealth of nutrients, tahini has also been associated with several benefits, including improved heart health, reduced inflammation, and potential cancer-fighting effects.

Tahini nutrition
Tahini is relatively low in calories but high in fiber, protein, and an assortment of important vitamins and minerals.
One tablespoon (15 grams) of tahini contains the following nutrients ( 1 ,  2 ):
Calories:  89
Protein:  3 grams
Carbs:  3 grams
Fat:  8 grams
Fiber: .7 grams
Copper:  27% of the Daily Value (DV)
Selenium:  9% of the DV
Phosphorus:  9% of the DV
Iron:  4% of the DV
Zinc:  6% of the DV
Calcium:  2% of the DV
Tahini is an especially good source of  copper , a trace mineral essential for iron absorption, blood clot formation, and blood pressure ( 3 ).
It’s also rich in  selenium , a mineral that helps decrease inflammation and promotes immune health, as well as phosphorus, which is involved in maintaining bone health ( 4 ,  5 ).
Tahini is rich in many nutrients, including protein, fiber, copper, selenium, and phosphorus.

Benefits of tahini
Due to its impressive nutrient profile, tahini has been linked to a number of health benefits.
Sesame seeds, which are the main ingredient in tahini, have a  powerful effect  on heart health by decreasing risk factors, such as high blood pressure, triglycerides, and LDL (bad) cholesterol.
In a 2014 study, 50 people with osteoarthritis completed standard medication therapy for 2 months, either with or without the addition of 40 grams, or about 1.5 tablespoons, of sesame seeds daily.
By the end of the study, participants in the sesame-seed group had significant reductions in triglyceride and LDL (bad)  cholesterol levels , compared with the control group ( 6 ).
According to a review of eight studies, sesame seeds may also reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (the top and bottom numbers or a reading), which could help prevent heart disease and stroke ( 7 ).
As tahini is made from ground sesame seeds, these findings apply to the paste as well.
Though acute inflammation is an important part of your immune response,  chronic inflammation  is believed to contribute to conditions like cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders ( 8 ).
Some research suggests that sesame seeds could protect against inflammation.
In one 2021 meta-analysis, subjects who consumed sesame seeds or sesame products daily were found to have reduced levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a protein that contributes to inflammation ( 9 ).
In another study, feeding sesame oil to mice lowered levels of several inflammatory markers after just three months ( 10 ).
Tahini contains sesamol, a natural compound in sesame seeds that is thought to have  anticancer properties  ( 11 ).
One test-tube study showed that sesamol blocked the growth and spread of liver cancer cells ( 12 ).
Other research in animals and test tubes suggests that sesamol could fight skin, colon, and cervical cancer cells as well ( 13 ,  14 ,  15 ).
However, current research is limited to test-tube and animal studies evaluating the effects of one specific component of tahini.
More research is needed to understand how tahini may impact cancer in humans.
Tahini and its components may help improve heart health, reduce inflammation, and prevent the growth of certain types of cancer cells.

How to add tahini to your diet
Tahini is very versatile and can be enjoyed in various ways.
It’s often spread over toast or used as a dip for pita bread.
It can also be mixed with  olive oil , lemon juice, Dijon mustard, and spices to create a rich and creamy homemade salad dressing.
Alternatively, try using it to dip your favorite veggies, such as carrots, bell peppers,  cucumbers , or celery sticks, for a healthy snack.
Tahini can even bring a unique flavor to baked goods and desserts like banana bread, cookies, or cake to help tone down the sweetness and add a nutty taste.
Tahini can be used as a spread, dip, or salad dressing. It can also be mixed into baked goods to add a unique nutty flavor.

Potential downsides
Despite the many benefits associated with tahini, there are some downsides to consider.
Tahini is high in  omega-6 fatty acids , a type of polyunsaturated fat found primarily in vegetable oils like sunflower, safflower, and corn oils ( 16 ).
Though your body needs omega-6 fatty acids, consuming a diet high in omega-6 fatty acids yet low in omega-3s may contribute to chronic inflammation ( 17 ).
Therefore, it’s important to keep your intake of omega-6 foods like tahini in moderation and round out your diet with plenty of foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as fatty  fish .
Additionally, some people may be allergic to sesame seeds, which can potentially cause severe side effects like anaphylaxis, an allergic reaction that can impair breathing ( 18 ).
If you suspect that you may have an allergy to sesame seeds, avoid eating tahini.
Tahini is rich in omega-6 fatty acids and could cause an adverse reaction in those who are allergic to sesame seeds.

The bottom line
Tahini is made from ground sesame seeds.
It’s rich in important nutrients like  fiber , protein, copper, phosphorus, and selenium and may reduce heart disease risk and inflammation.
What’s more, test-tube and animal studies suggest that sesame seeds may have anticancer properties.
Best of all, tahini is versatile and easy to use, which makes it a great addition to a healthy,  well-rounded diet .
