Title: WeightWatchers Review for 2024: A Dietitian’s Take

Our dietitians scored WeightWatchers highly for its flexible weight loss approach and access to virtual and in-person support. However, it isn’t cheap and requires food tracking, which can be time consuming.

Healthline diet score: 4.10 out of 5
From its humble beginnings as a weekly weight loss group for founder Jean Nidetch and her friends, WeightWatchers quickly grew into one of the most sought-after  diet plans  in the world.
Millions of people have joined it, hoping to lose weight.

Weight loss:  5
Adherence:  4.5
Whole body health:  3.5

Bottom line:  WeightWatchers uses a flexible, points-based system and has research to support its effectiveness.

Can WeightWatchers help you lose weight?
WeightWatchers uses a science-based approach to weight loss, emphasizing the importance of:
portion control
food choices
slow, consistent weight loss
Unlike many  fad diets  that promise unrealistic results over short periods of time, WeightWatchers says members can expect to lose 0.5 to 2 pounds (lb) [0.23 to 0.9 kilograms (kg)] per week, depending on their chosen plan.
The program highlights lifestyle modification and counsels members on how to choose foods using the Points system, which prioritizes healthy foods.
Several studies have shown that WeightWatchers can help promote short-term  weight loss .
In one study of 152 people with obesity, researchers found that people on WeightWatchers lost an average of  nearly 6%  of their body weight in 3 months. Plus, one-third of participants in this study were able to lose 10% or more of their body weight after 6 months.
Another  study  evaluated the effects of WeightWatchers in women of childbearing age and people considering or planning pregnancy with obesity.
The study found that the program was effective for short-term weight loss, with approximately one-third of participants losing at least 5% of their body weight in 12 weeks.
WeightWatchers is designed to support long-term, sustainable weight loss.
In fact, two studies from  2018  and  2021  investigating the cost-effectiveness of the WeightWatchers program found that it helped save significant amounts of money on future healthcare costs via weight reduction.
In one of these studies, researchers  found  that WeightWatchers was more cost-effective and more successful at reducing obesity than standard care.
In the other, researchers found that, on average, participants lost between  6.3 and 11.6 lb  (2.9 and 5.2 kg) in about 7 months.
Furthermore, a 2015 review of 39 controlled studies found that after 12 months, participants following the WeightWatchers program lost  2.6%  more weight than participants who received standard weight loss education.
Still, more recent research on the long-term effectiveness of WeightWatchers is lacking.

How does WeightWatchers work?
Initially, WeightWatchers used an exchange system, where foods were counted according to servings, similar to the diabetes exchange system. (The diabetes exchange system groups foods by carb counts so that you can easily swap one food for another with a similar amount of carbohydrates.)
In the 1990s, WeightWatchers introduced a points-based system that assigned values to foods and drinks based on their fiber, fat, and calorie content.
WeightWatchers has adjusted the points-based system several times over the years, most recently focusing on individualization and other health considerations that may affect your weight, like sleep, stress, and exercise.
The first step in signing up for WeightWatchers is to take the personal assessment, which asks questions about your current health habits and goals.
Once the assessment is complete, you’re prompted to sign up for one of three membership options:
WeightWatchers Membership:  The most basic option, this plan offers access to the WeightWatchers app, along with a customized weight loss and wellness plan, tracking tools, workouts, and meditations. It costs $23 for a 1-month membership, or as low as $11 per month for a 12-month membership.
WeightWatchers Membership + Workshops:  This plan offers everything from the basic plan, plus virtual and in-person meetups with a WeightWatchers coach and group. It starts at $45 for 1 month, or $22 per month if you sign up for 12 months.
WeightWatchers Clinic:  This plan combines the company’s basic membership with access to prescription weight loss medications and ongoing support from a dedicated care team. It’s only available to eligible individuals and starts at $84 per month.
You can further customize your plan by opting for the Diabetes Program, which includes a customized nutrition plan designed to help lower your A1C, or the GLP-1 Program, which is intended for people currently taking a  glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) medication  like  Wegovy  or  Zepbound .

What are WeightWatchers Points?
WeightWatchers Points are a stand-in for  calorie counting , designed to simplify eating healthily at a  calorie deficit . Your Points budget is based on your starting weight, weight goals, activity level, age, and reproductive status. For example, you’ll get more Points if you’re  breastfeeding or chestfeeding  because you need the extra calories.
There are also ZeroPoint foods, which anyone on WeightWatchers can eat without spending Points from their budget. However, the ZeroPoint lists are different depending on which program you’re on. For example, popcorn is a ZeroPoint food for some members, but not for those on the Diabetes plan since it may raise blood sugar.
Here’s a brief explanation of Points and ZeroPoint foods:
Points:  These are values assigned to foods based on their nutritional content. More nutritious foods, like fish and vegetables, are assigned fewer Points than more  heavily processed foods  like candy and soda.
ZeroPoint foods:  These are foods and beverages that don’t count toward your Points budget. There are over 200 ZeroPoint foods, including things like scrambled eggs (with no added fat), nonfat yogurt, fruit, and nonstarchy vegetables.
While no foods are off-limits, WeightWatchers recommends staying at or below your Points budget if weight loss is your goal.

WeightWatchers app
The WeightWatchers app is packed with features for members, including a food tracker, a  meal planning  tool, personalized eating plans, and more than 13,000 recipes.
In addition to encouraging healthy eating, WeightWatchers motivates you to stay active by assigning you a weekly fitness goal.
Activities like  dancing , walking, and cleaning, in addition to more traditional workouts like  running  and  weightlifting , all count toward your fitness goal. You can get extra Points in your Points budget by including exercise in your routine.
The app provides fitness videos and workout routines, along with a weekly review of your physical activity level.
Because sleep is a critical component of a healthy lifestyle, WeightWatchers also offers a sleep tracker and services from  Headspace , including sleep music, 5-minute behavior change coaching, and mini-meditations.
Another notable feature is the app’s built-in social network, which allows members to create posts, view other members’ posts, search by hashtags, and interact with others in group forums.

Weight loss medications
WeightWatchers recently launched WeightWatchers Clinic, a new membership option that combines WeightWatchers’ signature Points program with prescription  weight loss medications  to those who qualify.
These injectable medications — known as GLP-1 agonists — work by reducing appetite, slowing the emptying of the stomach, and increasing feelings of fullness to  promote  weight loss.
The program offers several different types of GLP-1 medications, including:
semaglutide ( Wegovy )
liraglutide (Saxenda)
tirzepatide (Zepbound)
In some cases, other types of medications may also be prescribed for weight loss, including naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave).
In addition to a weight loss prescription, a WeightWatchers Clinic membership also includes:
a WeightWatchers membership
a tailored nutrition plan
regular check-ins with a clinician to adjust your treatment plan as needed
support from a dedicated care team, including fitness trainers and registered dietitians
assistance from an insurance coordinator to help navigate insurance coverage
For this service, WeightWatchers offers flexible monthly plans starting at $84 per month, along with a $49 initial consultation fee. Note that this doesn’t include the  cost of GLP-1 medications , which can vary in price depending on your insurance coverage.

What can you eat on WeightWatchers?
Although the WeightWatchers Point system emphasizes whole, unprocessed foods, including vegetables, fruits, and lean proteins, no foods are off-limits.
While healthy choices are encouraged, members can choose any foods they want, as long as they stay under their daily Points allotment.
The WeightWatchers program also offers ZeroPoint foods. ZeroPoint foods may include fruits,  starchy and nonstarchy vegetables , lean proteins, lentils and beans, nonfat dairy, eggs, tofu, seafood and shellfish, and some whole grains.
lean proteins
healthy fats
nonstarchy vegetables
fresh, frozen, and unsweetened canned fruit
high fiber carbohydrates , such as sweet potatoes, brown rice, oatmeal, beans, and whole grain products
While the Points system allows members to choose any food they like, WeightWatchers discourages eating foods that are highly processed or high in added sugar and  saturated fats , such as:
sugary drinks
potato chips
processed meats
candy
cakes and cookies
However, WeightWatchers makes it clear that no foods are off-limits and members can eat their favorite snacks and desserts as long as they stay within their designated Points.

Customer reviews and brand reputation
Many reviewers are happy with WeightWatchers and report that they successfully lost weight on the program. Some reviewers say they appreciate that no foods are off-limits on WeightWatchers, which makes the program a much more sustainable approach to weight loss.
Of course, not all reviews are positive. Customers most frequently complain about expensive early cancellation fees, difficulties canceling their memberships, and confusion about how the WeightWatchers pricing structure works.
As a brand, WeightWatchers has been around for more than 60 years and currently holds an A rating from the  Better Business Bureau (BBB) .
However, in 2022, the  Federal Trade Commission (FTC)  filed a complaint against the company, which alleged that WeightWatchers marketed to and collected personal information from children.
The case has since been settled, with WeightWatchers paying a fine and agreeing to delete any illegally collected personal information and any algorithms derived from the data.
It’s also worth noting that the company has faced legal scrutiny because of how difficult it is to cancel a WeightWatchers membership.
Additionally, another recent class action lawsuit also alleged that WeightWatchers violated privacy regulations by sharing the video viewing history of users with Facebook.
WeightWatchers scored well during  Healthline’s vetting process  for not making any unsubstantiated health claims.
Additionally, while WeightWatchers coaches aren’t required to be licensed health professionals, the company doesn’t mislead consumers into thinking that coaches are doctors or dietitians.

WeightWatchers vs. competitors
Here’s a quick look at how WeightWatchers compares with a few of its competitors:  Noom ,  Ro Body , and  Calibrate .
It’s worth noting that Noom Med’s $49 monthly cost is in addition to the cost of a Noom app subscription. However, WeightWatchers’ $84 per month medication plan includes full access to the WeightWatchers program.
The cost for each service listed above doesn’t include the cost of weight loss medications, which may be covered by insurance in some instances.

Should you try WeightWatchers?
As with any diet program, WeightWatchers may be a good fit for some and not a great fit for others. Here’s a quick look at who should or shouldn’t give it a try.
WeightWatchers may be a great fit for people who:
haven’t had success with restrictive diets
need more flexibility to be successful
want to develop healthy habits that will stick
want support from a coach or support group (although this group should sign up for the Membership + Workshops option)
While WeightWatchers has many benefits, there are several reasons why it may not be the best plan for everyone. It:
Requires food tracking:  Following the program requires tracking foods — and their associated Points — that you consume each day. This can be a tedious and time-consuming task and may be a turnoff for some.
May be too lenient:  The WeightWatchers program may be too lenient for those whose top concern is self-control. Especially with an allotment of calorie-containing ZeroPoint foods, it’s possible to eat higher quantities of calories without going over your Points budget. This can make it difficult to lose weight.
Doesn’t guarantee a balanced diet:  Similarly, while the program encourages the intake of nutrient-rich foods, members can theoretically choose to eat foods that are high in sugar and low in nutrients and still stay under their set number of Points.
Isn’t free:  Another potential downfall is that it may be too expensive for some people. Though monthly costs vary depending on the subscription plan, the total investment might be out of reach for those on a budget.
Trying to “do it right” when it comes to nutrition may feel tempting, but it can backfire.
If you’re preoccupied with food or your weight, feel guilt surrounding your food choices, or routinely engage in restrictive diets, consider reaching out for support. These behaviors may indicate a disordered relationship with food or an eating disorder.
Disordered eating  and eating disorders can affect anyone, regardless of gender identity, race, age, body size, socioeconomic status, or other identities.
They can be caused by any combination of biological, social, cultural, and environmental factors — not just by exposure to diet culture.
Feel empowered to talk with a qualified healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian, if you’re having a hard time.
