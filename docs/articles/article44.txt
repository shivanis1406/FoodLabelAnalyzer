Title: 16 Fascinating Types of Grapes

Bite-sized, sweet, and juicy, grapes are a favorite of fruit lovers around the world.
They come in an abundance of colors and flavors, and some types are used differently than others.
For example, some grape varieties  —  known as table grapes  —  are typically eaten fresh or made into dried fruit or juice, while others are favored for winemaking.
Here are 16 types of grapes, including some you may have never heard of.

1. Concord
Concord grapes have a deep bluish-purple hue and are commonly enjoyed fresh as table grapes. They’re also used to make flavorful juices, jellies, jams, and baked goods.
These jewel-toned grapes are packed with nutrients and particularly high in flavonoid antioxidants and the phenolic compound resveratrol, which are both powerful plant compounds that offer  anticancer , anti-inflammatory, and heart-health benefits ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ).
In fact, one study showed that Concord grapes have significantly higher Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) than red or green grapes ( 4 ).

2. Cotton Candy
Cotton Candy grapes were first produced in California in 2011 and have been a hit with consumers ever since. These candy-like grapes were made by hybridizing grape species to create a unique taste ( 5 ).
Cotton Candy grapes are green and taste oddly similar to the cloud-like confectionary cotton candy.
However, unlike traditional cotton candy, Cotton Candy grapes are packed with nutrients, such as vitamin C,  fiber , and potassium, making them a smart snacking choice to satisfy your sweet tooth ( 6 ).
Still, keep in mind that these grapes are slightly higher in sugar than Concord grapes due to their intense sweetness ( 7 ).

3. Moon Drops
The unique shape and delightfully sweet taste of Moon Drops make this interesting grape variety stand out from other table grapes.
Considered a type of seedless black grape, Moon Drops have a surprisingly crunchy texture and are  deep blue  — almost black — in color. They’re also long and tubular and have a distinctive dimple on one end.
These grapes make an excellent snack choice. Due to their large size, they can be stuffed with fillings like whipped cheese or roasted and tossed into a leafy salad to add natural sweetness.

4. Flame Seedless
Celebrated for its delectable flavor, Flame Seedless is a popular table grape variety. These medium-sized grapes grow in large clusters and have a deep red color.
Plus, they’re high in nutrients and pack numerous beneficial compounds.
For example, the red hue of Flame Seedless comes from plant pigments called anthocyanins. Anthocyanins act as powerful antioxidants in your body, protecting your cells against damage from  oxidative stress .
One test-tube study showed that extracts from the skin and flesh of Flame seedless exhibited the strongest protection against oxidative-stress-induced cellular damage in liver tissue, compared with three other grape varieties ( 8 ).

5. Dominga
Dominga is a type of white table grape with a sweet, pleasing flavor and yellowish skin.
Research shows that they’re particularly high in  polyphenol  antioxidants ( 9 ).
In particular, they contain higher amounts of Flavan-3-ols than other grapes. These compounds have been shown to benefit heart health ( 10 ).
Consuming polyphenol-rich foods like Dominga grapes may help preserve mental function and offer neuroprotective effects, as well as boosting many other aspects of health ( 11 ).

6. Red Globe
Red Globe grapes are a large, seeded table grape enjoyed by people around the world, especially in Asian countries. They have a rosy, red color and firm, crisp flesh.
These subtly sweet grapes offer an abundance of nutrients and beneficial plant compounds ( 12 ).
Because of their large size, Red Globe grapes are suggested for snacking and can even be  frozen  to use as ice cubes, keeping drinks cold while infusing them with a delightful taste.

7. Crimson
Crimson grapes are seedless, with a lovely dark pink to light red skin and green flesh. Their sweet taste and crisp texture make them a popular snacking grape.
This variety was introduced in 1989 after being created by plant breeders in California ( 13 ).
Like other red grapes, Crimson grapes are packed with anthocyanins, which give these fruits their beautiful color and also contribute to their health benefits ( 14 ).

8. Black Muscat
Black Muscat is a variety thought to have been created in the 1800s by hybridizing Muscat of Alexandria and Trollinger grapes.
They’re versatile and enjoyed fresh as table grapes while also used for making several types of wine, including  dessert wines  and dry red wines.
These large grapes are bluish-black and give off a pleasant floral aroma. They have a deliciously sweet, juicy taste and pair perfectly with salty, rich foods like cheeses.
In fact, one study rated Black Muscat grapes as significantly sweeter, juicier, and more aromatic than five other grape varieties tested ( 15 ).
The study also suggests that Black Muscat has the highest levels of various bioactive compounds, such as alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, and monoterpenols, which may benefit health ( 15 ).

9. Centennial
Centennial grapes are a large white grape variety. They’re enjoyed as a table grape and commonly used to make large  raisins  perfect for snacking and baking.
The Centennial grape was created in 1966 at the University of California by plant breeder Harold P. Olmo. These grapes are seedless and have a thin yellowish skin that covers firm, sweet flesh ( 16 ).

10. Thompson Seedless
As their name implies, Thompson Seedless grapes are a seedless variety. Favored for their sweet taste, they’re the most widely grown white table grape in the U.S. state of California.
These green grapes were named after William Thompson, the first person to popularize this variety in America.
However, it was later discovered that Thompson Seedless grapes were an ancient grape variety that originated in Persia called Sultanina. Thompson Seedless grapes are known by several other names around the world including  Sultana  and Oval Kishmish ( 17 ).
Thompson Seedless is considered one of the most important varieties because it has been used to breed many other types of grapes. For example, it’s the main grape used to create seedless varieties ( 17 ).

11. Autumn Royal
Autumn Royal was created by fruit breeders David Ramming and Ron Tarailo in Fresno, California, in 1996. These large grapes have deep purple-black skin and bright yellow-green flesh ( 18 ).
Autumn Royals are seedless and have a rich, sweet taste and firm, crunchy texture, which makes them a popular table grape. They’re among the largest seedless grape varieties available ( 18 ).

12. Tempranillo
Tempranillo grapes originated in Spain and are primarily used to make  red wine . These dark, blackish grapes create full-bodied, flavorful wines often described as having a complex, smooth flavor with notes of cherry, strawberry, or black currant ( 19 ).
Tempranillo grapes are often blended with other grape varieties, such as Syrah, Grenache, or Cabernet Sauvignon, to create delicious wines.
Tempranillo wines are often said to pair best with savory foods, such as lamb, pork, or spicy dishes.

13. Glenora
Glenora is a seedless table grape created in 1952 by crossing Ontario and Russian Seedless grapes ( 20 ).
They’re highly prolific and grow in large, uniform clusters. The grapes are medium-sized and deep bluish-black.
They have an interesting flavor profile that’s often described as sweet with slightly spicy undertones.
Glenora grapes are disease resistant and easy to grow, making them a popular variety with home gardeners and farmers alike.

14. Marquis
Marquis is a white seedless variety that produces large, round fruits. It was developed by plant breeders at Cornell University in 1966 by crossing Emerald Seedless and Athens grapes ( 21 ).
They’re very juicy and have soft, green skin. Marquis grapes are commonly enjoyed as a table grape and can be used to make delicious jams and baked goods.
This cold-hardy variety is tolerant of many soil conditions and has large, fragrant  flowers  that attract beneficial pollinators like honey bees, making it a popular breed with home gardeners ( 22 ).

15. Koshu
Koshu is a grape native to Japan that’s enjoyed as a table grape and also used to make wine. It’s one of the most popular and widely planted grape varieties in Japan.
Koshu grapes are tart with pale  purple  skin. Genetic testing has revealed that they were created through the hybridization of wild grape species, including  V .  davidii  ( 23 ).
Koshu grapes are primarily grown in an area of Japan known as the Koshu Valley, which has the highest concentration of wineries in the country. They’re used to produce white wines that offer fruity, delicate, and refreshing flavors.

16. Kyoho
Similar to Concord grapes, Kyoho have a deep blackish-purple color. They were created by crossing Centennial grapes with a variety known as Ishiharawase and have been the most popularly cultivated variety in  Japan  since 1994 ( 24 ).
Their thick skin surrounds juicy, flavorful flesh that has an intensely sweet flavor. Kyohos are very large, and a single grape can weigh as much as 0.5 ounces (14 grams) ( 24 ).
Kyoho grapes are packed with beneficial plant compounds, including anthocyanins. One study investigating the anthocyanin content of Kyoho grapes identified 23 types of anthocyanins in the skin alone ( 25 ).

The bottom line
Grapes  come in an abundance of colors, textures, flavors, and sizes. Depending on the variety, grapes can be used for snacking or made into delicious jams, juices, and wines.
