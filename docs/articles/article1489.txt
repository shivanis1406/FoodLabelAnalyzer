Title: Can You Treat Psoriasis with Dietary Detoxes or Cleanses?

“Detox diets” are often touted as a natural way to eliminate toxins, improve skin health, and reduce psoriasis symptoms. But these “cleanses” are often restrictive, unsustainable, and, in some cases, dangerous.
Psoriasis is an  autoimmune condition  that causes skin cells to accumulate and become red, itchy, and dry.
Although certain dietary factors may affect your symptoms, so-called “ detox diets ” promising a quick fix aren’t the solution.
No scientific evidence suggests that these diets remove toxins, enhance immune function, or cleanse your body.
Your body has its own detoxification system — involving the liver, lungs, kidneys, skin, and digestive system — responsible for getting rid of harmful chemicals and compounds.
This naturally occurring process  doesn’t require  dietary intervention or supplementation.
While detox diets may improve psoriasis symptoms for some people, it’s likely due to limiting specific dietary triggers rather than eliminating entire food groups.

What does a detox diet for psoriasis involve?
Although the exact recommendations can vary, a detox diet usually involves eliminating anything considered inflammatory.
This typically includes some or all of the following:
dairy
red meat
alcohol
added sugars
refined carbs
nightshades
fried foods
gluten
Instead, you’re  meant to eat  a variety of antioxidant- and nutrient-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.

What side effects or risks are associated with a detox diet for psoriasis?
More restrictive diets may make it harder to meet your nutrient needs and even increase your risk of  nutritional deficiencies .
For example, poorly planned gluten-free diets  are often  low in fiber and may lack important  micronutrients  like zinc, magnesium, iron, calcium, vitamin B12, and folate.
Other foods often avoided on detox diets provide  essential nutrients . This includes  dairy products  and nightshade vegetables like  tomatoes ,  eggplants , and  peppers .
Furthermore, detox diets can promote unhealthy eating habits and foster a  negative relationship  with food.
They can also be unsustainable and difficult to follow in the long run. Your psoriasis symptoms are likely to return once you resume a regular diet.

What does the research say about the impact of food on psoriasis?
Research indicates that diet may play a significant role in psoriasis.
For example, a  2017 survey  involving 1,206 people with psoriasis showed that certain dietary modifications seemed to improve skin conditions in the majority of respondents.
Some of the most effective modifications included decreasing alcohol, gluten, and nightshade intake or increasing fish oil, vegetable, and  vitamin D  intake.
Still, these skin health improvements were subjective, and not all dietary modifications were equally effective.
For instance, only 54% of participants reported that  reducing alcohol consumption  was helpful, and fewer than 43% noted improvements with  increased vegetable intake .
Other dietary factors may also affect psoriasis severity.
According to a  small 2014 study  including 200 people, those with psoriasis tended to have lower antioxidant levels and higher levels of oxidative stress than a control group.
These results  suggest  that a diet rich in antioxidants may alleviate psoriasis symptoms by combating oxidative stress.
Other research indicates that  fried foods , added sugar, refined carbs, and processed meats  may increase  certain markers of inflammation, which  could contribute  to psoriasis.
Some studies  also show  that those with  celiac disease  or  non-celiac gluten sensitivity  may have a higher risk of psoriasis. For these individuals, eliminating gluten may help relieve symptoms.
Nonetheless, following a  gluten-free diet  may not benefit those without gluten-related disorders.
In fact, in  a study  of 85,185 people with psoriasis, 85,324 people with psoriatic arthritis and 63,443 people with atopic dermatitis concluded that increased gluten intake wasn’t associated with a higher risk of each respective condition.

What can you try instead of a detox diet for psoriasis?
The same food item or ingredient can have  different effects  on different people. It’s important to find what works for you rather than eliminating entire food groups from your diet.
If you can tolerate  gluten , for example, there’s no need to follow a restrictive diet that cuts out gluten completely.
Some  research suggests  that adding more  whole grains  to your diet lowers levels of inflammation, which may be beneficial for psoriasis.
Instead of following a short-term detox diet, stick to a nutritious,  balanced diet  rich in fruits, vegetables, protein, and  heart-healthy fats .
Doing so will ensure that you’re meeting your nutritional needs and make it much easier to identify potential triggers by  eliminating one or two  ingredients at a time.

The bottom line
Psoriasis detox diets often ban foods and beverages that may  trigger symptoms , including gluten, alcohol, added sugars, nightshades, and refined carbs.
While eliminating certain items may benefit those with psoriasis, detox diets, quick fixes, and cleanses may be unnecessarily restrictive and promote an unhealthy relationship with food.
Instead, it’s best to follow a healthy, well-rounded diet while removing potential trigger foods one at a time to find what works for you.
