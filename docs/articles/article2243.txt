Title: 8 Foods to Avoid with a Gluten Intolerance (and 7 to Eat)

If you have a gluten intolerance, it’s important to avoid any grains, breads, pastas, and baked goods that contain this protein. But there are plenty of healthy gluten-free options to keep you satisfied.
Many people avoid eating  gluten  — a group of proteins found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye — due to personal preference or a medical condition.
Celiac disease, wheat allergy, and  non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS)  all involve a negative reaction to gluten and are treated with a gluten-free diet. These conditions are considered gluten-related disorders, though they are sometimes referred to as forms of  gluten intolerance .
Both celiac disease and NCGS cause symptoms such as  diarrhea , gas, and bloating and may lead to  intestinal damage . But celiac disease is an autoimmune condition that is linked to other serious health effects, such as anemia, stunted growth, and  neurological effects .
Wheat allergy  involves to an allergic reaction to wheat proteins, which may cause life threatening symptoms. This condition is treated with a wheat-free diet but not necessarily a  gluten-free diet .
Although people with wheat allergies must avoid wheat, most can eat other grains, including gluten-containing grains such as  barley  and rye.
Meanwhile, people with celiac disease and NCGS must avoid all gluten-containing foods to manage their symptoms. Notably, many nutritious foods are naturally  gluten-free , and quite a few companies make delicious gluten-free products.

Tips for eating out
Many restaurants don’t offer gluten-free meals, so it’s important to know what you can safely order if you have a gluten intolerance and are going out to eat.
If you have celiac disease, NCGS, or a wheat allergy, it’s important that you inform the waitstaff. The restaurant is much more likely to take your condition seriously if they know you can’t have gluten for medical reasons.
In general, you should stay away from pasta, bread, and grain dishes unless the restaurant offers gluten-free options like brown rice pasta or gluten-free grains.
You’ll also need to avoid bread baskets. Instead, ask the waitstaff to bring a gluten-free appetizer such as  edamame , a caprese or simple salad, or crudités with hummus.
Fried foods  such as french fries, fried chicken, fried fish, and mozzarella sticks usually contain gluten, so you should avoid them as well.
When choosing a meal, keep it simple and use the following steps to create a gluten-free meal:
Choose a protein source:  fish, shrimp, chicken, beef, beans, plain tofu, lentils, etc.
Choose a gluten-free starch or grain:  potatoes, sweet potatoes, winter squash, amaranth, quinoa, brown rice, etc.
Choose a non-starchy vegetable:  broccoli, cauliflower, pepper, mushrooms, zucchini, spinach, green beans, etc.
Customizable salads and gluten-free grain bowls make great meal choices.
If you don’t trust the salad dressings or sauces used at restaurants, you can bring your own from home. Simply pour a small amount into a portable glass jar or bottle.
To ensure that you’ll have gluten-free options, it’s a good idea to scan the menu before choosing to eat at a restaurant. You can also call ahead to discuss your options with the staff.
When you go out to eat, check the menu for gluten-free items and be sure to inform the server if you have a gluten sensitivity.
