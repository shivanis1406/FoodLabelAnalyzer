Title: 7 Emerging Benefits of Bacopa monnieri (Brahmi)

Bacopa monnieri is an ancient herbal remedy that today has proven benefits. It may help improve inflammation, reduce ADHD symptoms, and prevent anxiety and stress.
Bacopa monnieri , also called brahmi, water hyssop, thyme-leaved gratiola, and herb of grace, is a staple plant in traditional Ayurvedic medicine.
It grows in wet, tropical environments, and its ability to thrive underwater makes it popular for aquarium use ( 1 ).
Bacopa monnieri  has been used by Ayurvedic medical practitioners for centuries for a variety of purposes, including improving memory, reducing anxiety, and treating epilepsy ( 2 ).
In fact, research shows that it may boost brain function and alleviate anxiety and stress, among other benefits.
A class of powerful compounds called bacosides in  Bacopa monnieri  is believed to be responsible for these benefits.
Here are 7 emerging benefits of  Bacopa monnieri .

1. Contains powerful antioxidants
Antioxidants  are substances that help protect against cell damage caused by potentially harmful molecules called free radicals.
Research suggests that damage caused by free radicals is linked to many chronic conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers ( 3 ).
Bacopa monnieri  contains powerful compounds that may have antioxidant effects.
For example, bacosides, the main active compounds in  Bacopa monnieri , have been shown to neutralize free radicals and prevent fat molecules from reacting with free radicals ( 4 ).
When fat molecules react with free radicals, they undergo a process called lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation is linked to several conditions, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other neurodegenerative disorders ( 5 ,  6 ).
Bacopa monnieri  may help prevent damage caused by this process.
For example, an older study showed that treating rats with dementia with  Bacopa monnieri  reduced free radical damage and reversed signs of memory impairment ( 7 ).
More studies in humans are needed to better understand the effects of Bacopa monnieri on on neurodegenerative disease, if any. A systematic review of 5 randomized controlled trials found no benefit of this herb in the treatment of Alzheimer’s, though the authors did note that the studies were of small sample sizes ( 8 ,  9 ).
Bacopa monnieri  contains active compounds called bacosides, which have been shown to have antioxidant effects, especially in the brain.

2. May reduce inflammation
Inflammation is your body’s natural response to help heal and fight disease.
However, chronic, low-level  inflammation  has been linked to many chronic conditions, including cancer, diabetes, and heart and kidney disease ( 10 ).
In test-tube studies,  Bacopa monnieri  appeared to suppress the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are molecules that stimulate an inflammatory immune response ( 11 ).
Also, in test-tube and animal studies, it inhibited enzymes, such as cyclooxygenases, caspases, and lipoxygenases — all of which play key roles in inflammation and pain ( 11 ,  12 ).
What’s more, in animal studies,  Bacopa monnieri  had anti-inflammatory effects comparable to those of diclofenac and indomethacin — two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs commonly used to treat inflammation ( 12 ,  13 ).
Nevertheless, more research is needed to determine whether  Bacopa monnieri  reduces inflammation in humans.
Test-tube and animal studies show that  Bacopa monnieri  may have potent anti-inflammatory properties and suppress pro-inflammatory enzymes and cytokines.

3. May boost brain function
Older studies suggests that  Bacopa monnieri  may help  enhance brain function .
For example, one study in mice showed that supplementing with  Bacopa monnieri  improved their spatial learning and ability to retain information ( 14 ).
The same study also found that it increased dendritic length and branching. Dendrites are parts of nerve cells in the brain that are closely linked to learning and memory ( 14 ).
Additionally, a 12-week study in 46 healthy adults observed that taking 300 mg of  Bacopa monnieri  daily significantly improved the speed of processing visual information, learning rate, and memory, compared with the placebo treatment ( 15 ).
Another 12-week study in 60 older adults found that taking either 300 mg or 600 mg of  Bacopa monnieri  extract daily improved memory, attention, and the ability to process information, compared with the placebo treatment ( 16 ).
Animal and human studies show that  Bacopa monnieri  may helpimprove memory, attention, and the ability to process visual information.

4. May help reduce ADHD symptoms
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by symptoms like hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattentiveness ( 17 ).
Interestingly, research has shown that  Bacopa monnieri  may help  reduce ADHD symptoms .
One study in 31 children aged 6–12 years found that taking 225 mg of  Bacopa monnieri  extract daily for 6 months significantly reduced ADHD symptoms, such as restlessness, poor self-control, inattention, and impulsivity in 85% of the children ( 18 ).
A more recent study of 112 males aged 6-14 years with ADHD found cognitive, mood, and sleep benefits among those taking Bacopa monnieri, but saw no effect on behavioral outcomes ( 19 ).
Although some findings are promising, more large-scale studies examining the effects of  Bacopa monnieri  on ADHD are needed before it can be recommended as a treatment.
Bacopa monnieri  may help reduce ADHD symptoms, such as restlessness and self-control, but more large-scale human studies are needed.

5. May prevent anxiety and stress
Bacopa monnieri  may help  prevent anxiety and stress . It’s considered an adaptogenic herb, meaning that it increases your body’s resistance to stress ( 20 ).
Research suggests that  Bacopa monnieri  helps reduce stress and anxiety by elevating your mood and reducing levels of  cortisol , a hormone that is closely linked to stress levels ( 21 ).
One rodent study showed that  Bacopa monnieri  had anti-anxiety effects comparable to those of lorazepam (benzodiazepine), a prescription medication used to treat anxiety ( 22 ).
However, human studies on  Bacopa monnieri  and anxiety show mixed results.
For example, two 12-week human studies found that taking 300 mg of  Bacopa monnieri  daily significantly reduced anxiety and depression scores in adults, compared with the placebo treatment ( 1 ,  15 ).
A more recent human study found taking 500 mg Bacopa monnieri twice daily for 4 weeks reduced depression, anxiety and stress ( 23 ).
Yet, another human study found that treatment with  Bacopa monnieri  had no effect on anxiety ( 24 ).
More large-scale human studies are needed to confirm its effects on stress and anxiety.
Bacopa monnieri  may help reduce stress and anxiety by elevating mood and reducing cortisol levels. However, human studies show mixed results.

6. May help lower blood pressure levels
High blood pressure is a serious health concern, as it places strain on your heart and blood vessels. This can weaken your heart and increase your risk of heart disease ( 25 ,  26 ).
Research suggests that  Bacopa monnieri  may help keep blood pressure within a healthy range.
In one animal study,  Bacopa monnieri  reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. It did this by releasing nitric oxide, which helps dilate blood vessels, resulting in  improved blood flow  and lower blood pressure ( 27 ,  28 ).
A 2020 study of 69 participants on high blood pressure medication found an herbal supplement which included Bacopa monnieri among other herbs lowered blood pressure and increased nitric oxide levels ( 29 ).
However, one older 12-week study in 54 healthy older adults found that taking 300 mg of  Bacopa monnieri  daily had no effect on blood pressure levels ( 30 ).
Based on current findings,  Bacopa monnieri  may lower blood pressure in animals with high blood pressure levels. Nevertheless, more human research is required to confirm these effects.
Bacopa monnieri  may help reduce blood pressure in animals with high blood pressure levels. However, human research in this area is lacking.

7. May have anticancer properties
Test-tube and animal studies have found that  Bacopa monnieri  may have anticancer properties.
Bacosides, the active class of compounds in  Bacopa monnieri , have been shown to kill aggressive brain tumor cells and inhibit the growth of breast, brain, and colon cancer cells in test-tube studies ( 31 ,  32 ,  33 ).
Additionally,  Bacopa monnieri  induced breast cancer cell death in animal and test-tube studies ( 34 ).
Research suggests that the high levels of antioxidants and compounds like bacosides in  Bacopa monnieri  may be responsible for its cancer-fighting properties ( 35 ).
Keep in mind that these results are from test-tube and animal studies. Until there are more human studies on  Bacopa monnieri  and cancer, it cannot be recommended as a treatment.
Bacopa monnieri  has been shown to block the growth and spread of cancer cells in test-tube and animal studies, but human research is needed to confirm these effects.

Bacopa monnieri side effects
While  Bacopa monnieri  is considered safe, it may cause side effects in some people.
For example, it may cause digestive symptoms, including nausea, stomach cramps, and diarrhea ( 36 ).
Furthermore, bacopa monnieri  is not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women, as no studies have assessed the safety of its use during pregnancy or lactation ( 37 ).
Finally, it may interact with certain medications, including amitriptyline, a medication used as an antidepressant and for pain relief ( 38 ).
If you are taking any medications, speak with your healthcare provider before taking  Bacopa monnieri.
Bacopa monnieri  is generally safe, but some people may experience nausea, stomach cramps, and diarrhea. Pregnant women should avoid this herb, while those on medications should speak with their healthcare provider before taking it.

How to take Bacopa monnieri
Bacopa monnieri  can be purchased online and from health food stores.
It’s available in several forms, including capsules and powders.
Typical dosages for  Bacopa monnieri  extract in human studies range from 300–450 mg per day ( 39 ).
However, dosage recommendations can vary widely depending on the product you purchase. If you have questions regarding dosage, speak with a qualified health professional to ensure your safety.
The powdered form can be added to hot water to make a soothing tea. It can also be mixed with  ghee  — a form of clarified butter — and added to warm water to make an herbal drink.
Although  Bacopa monnieri  is considered safe for most people, speak with your healthcare provider before taking it to ensure your safety and proper usage.
Bacopa monnieri  is available in several forms but is most commonly taken in capsule form. Typical doses range from 300–450 mg per day.

The bottom line
Bacopa monnieri  is an ancient Ayurvedic herbal remedy for many ailments.
This herbal supplement is not regulated by the FDA and it has not been approved for the treatment of any medical conditions. In 2019, the FDA had to warn a company for using unauthorized health claims to market herbal supplements which included Bacopa monnieri ( 37 ).
Human studies show it may help boost brain function, treat ADHD symptoms, and reduce stress and anxiety. Furthermore, test-tube and animal studies have found that it may possess anticancer properties and reduce inflammation and blood pressure.
Although these potential health benefits are promising, more research on  Bacopa monnieri  is needed to understand its full effects in humans.
