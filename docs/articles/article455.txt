Title: 10 Natural Appetite Suppressants That May Help You Lose Weight

Certain herbs and plants may help promote weight loss by reducing appetite. They may do this by making you feel more full, slowing how your stomach empties, blocking nutrient absorption, or influencing appetite hormones.
This article focuses on natural herbs and plants that have been shown to help you eat less food by suppressing appetite, increasing feelings of fullness, or reducing food cravings.
Here are 10 natural appetite suppressants that may help you lose weight.

1. Fenugreek
Fenugreek  is an herb from the legume family. The seeds, after being dried and ground, are the most commonly used part of the plant.
Fenugreek contains both  soluble and insoluble fiber , which can  increase feelings of fullness  and lead to a lower food intake.
In  one study , nine Korean females with overweight consumed  fennel , fenugreek, or a placebo tea before attending a buffet.
Compared with other participants, those who drank fenugreek tea had:
less hunger
less inclination to eat
a greater feeling of fullness
However, there were no differences in the amount of food the groups ate.
In addition, this was a small study, and it was unclear whether the effect was due to fiber or other ingredients in fenugreek. More research is needed to confirm the benefits of fenugreek in suppressing appetite.
Fenugreek seeds contains fiber and may help reduce appetite by increasing feelings of fullness.

2. Glucomannan and other viscous fiber
Dietary  fiber , such as  glucomannan , may  help manage  appetite and weight. Glucomannan  is present  in  Konjac , a starchy root vegetable used to make noodles and other foods.
A 2020 review concluded that consuming  viscous fiber  — such as glucomannan — may modestly but significantly reduce body weight and other measures of fat, especially in people with high body weight, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.
The  Office of Dietary Supplements  notes that taking up to 15.1 g per day of glucomannan for several weeks is likely safe, although tablets can pose a choking hazard.
Some people have also experienced loose stools, flatulence, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal discomfort as adverse effects.
Glucomannan is a type of fiber that may help suppress your appetite. It forms a viscous gel, which delays fat and carb absorption.

3. Gymnema sylvestre
Gymnema sylvestre  has long been used in India as an antidiabetes medication, but it may also have anti-obesity properties.
Some  research  from 2012 suggests that  Gymnema sylvestre  has properties that may help manage blood lipids and other factors that tend to be high in people with obesity.
In the study, rats that consumed a high-fat diet followed by  Gymnema sylvestre  extract for 28 days experienced decreases in cholesterol levels and BMI.
However, more investigations are needed to establish whether  Gymnema sylvestre  is safe and effective in helping humans manage weight and appetite.
Gymnema sylvestre  is an herb that can may help reduce obesity.

4. Griffonia simplicifolia (5-HTP)
Griffonia simplicifolia  is a plant that contains  5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) , a compound that is converted into serotonin in the brain. An increase in serotonin levels may help  suppress appetite , according to some  research .
Some older, limited  research  suggests that 5-HTP may help people overcome obesity by inducing feelings of fullness.
However, taking 5-HTP supplements may increase the risk of  serotonin syndrome , a potentially serious condition. Always consult a doctor before using these or other supplements.
Griffonia simplicifolia  is a plant rich in 5-HTP. This compound is converted into serotonin in the brain, which has been shown to decrease appetite.

5. Caralluma fimbriata
Caralluma fimbriata  is an herb that may suppress appetite and manage obesity.
In one  study , 83 adults with overweight took supplements with either  Caralluma fimbriata  extract or a placebo for 16 weeks. At the end of the study, those taking  Caralluma fimbriata  extract had a reduction in calorie intake and waist circumference. They also did not gain weight, while those in the placebo group did.
A  2021 review  noted that taking  Caralluma fimbriata  extract may reduce waist circumference but does not appear to affect body weight or BMI. Possible adverse effects include constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and rashes.
Caralluma fimbriata  is an herb that may help decrease appetite levels. Combined with exercise and a calorie-controlled diet, it may help promote weight loss.

6. Green tea extract
Green tea extract  may be  effective for weight loss , among other health benefits.
Green tea contains two compounds that may contribute to its weight loss: caffeine and catechins.
Caffeine is a stimulant that increases  fat burning  and suppresses appetite, while green tea catechins — particularly  epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)  — may  boost metabolism  and reduce fat.
The authors of  one review  note that consuming green tea with ECGC levels of 100–460 milligrams (mg) per day for 12 weeks may help reduce body weight and fat mass, while adding in caffeine at 80–300 mg/day may increase the effect.
Another  study, from 2012 , found evidence that drinking beverages containing soluble fiber, ECGC, and caffeine can leave people less likely to eat so much at the next meal.
Green tea extract contains caffeine and catechins, which can boost metabolism, burn fat, and aid weight loss. Combining green tea extract with other ingredients may decrease appetite levels and reduce food intake.

7. Conjugated linoleic acid
Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)  is a type of fat present in some animal fats and as supplements.
Some  experiments  have suggested CLA supplements might help  improve body composition  and  reduce body fat  and obesity, but more studies are needed.
Conjugated linoleic acid is a a naturally-occurring trans fat that may help with weight loss. It may work by changing the way your body metabolizes fat.

8. Garcinia cambogia
Garcinia cambogia  comes from a fruit of the same name, also known as  Garcinia gummi-gutta .
The peel of this fruit contains high concentrations of hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which may have weight loss properties.
A  2022 review  of eight trials, with data for 530 participants, suggested that Garcinia supplements could reduce:
body weight
the percentage of fat mass
waist circumference
However,  more studies  are needed to confirm the safety and effectiveness of Garcinia HCA supplements for weight management.
Garcinia cambogia contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA). HCA has been shown to help increase serotonin levels, which may improve fullness levels. However, some studies show no significant effects from this supplement.

9. Yerba mate
Yerba mate  is a plant native to South America. It’s known for its energy-boosting properties.
Some  research  has suggested that taking capsules containing a total of 3 g of yerba mate daily for 12 weeks may help reduce body fat and improve the waist-hip ratio of people with obesity.
Moreover, a  study  of 12 healthy women has indicated that taking 2 g of yerba mate before performing a 30-minute  cycling  exercise reduced appetite and also boosted metabolism, focus, and  energy levels .
Yerba mate  appears to be safe  and does not seem to produce any severe side effects. However, drinking yerba mate very hot and reusing the same leaves may lead to a higher risk of esophageal and other types of cancer.
Yerba mate is a plant known for its energy-boosting properties, and it may also help with appetite reduction and weight loss.

10. Coffee
Studies  suggest that the caffeine in coffee may  help promote weight loss  by:
increasing calorie burn
boosting fat breakdown
reducing appetite
It seems that ingesting caffeine  0.5–4 hours  before a meal may influence stomach emptying,  appetite hormones , and feelings of hunger.
Nevertheless, note that a high caffeine intake  may raise  blood pressure in some people.
The caffeine in coffee may help reduce appetite, delay stomach emptying, and influence appetite hormones, all of which can help you eat less. Caffeine may also increase fat burn and aid weight loss.

The bottom line
Certain herbs and plants may help promote weight loss.
Depending on the herb, they may do this by:
suppressing appetite
increasing fullness levels
slowing stomach emptying
blocking the absorption of nutrients
influencing appetite hormones
boosting the burning of energy
breaking down fat
The items listed above may offer a  natural approach to weight loss  alongside dietary measures and exercise.
