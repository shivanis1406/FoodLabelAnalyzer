Title: Can You Eat Pork Rare? All You Need to Know

Though raw pork dishes exist in some cultures, eating raw or undercooked pork is risky business that can yield serious and unpleasant side effects.
Some foods, like certain fish and seafood, can be enjoyed raw when prepared safely — though pork is definitely not one of these foods.
This article explores the risks and side effects of consuming raw or undercooked pork, and provides some tips to keep you healthy.

Is eating rare pork safe?
Unlike steak, which can be eaten without being fully brown on the inside, pork that’s bloody (or rare) on the inside should not be consumed.
This is because pork meat, which comes from pigs, is prone to certain bacteria and parasites that are killed in the cooking process.
Thus, when pork isn’t cooked through to its proper temperature, there’s a risk that those bacteria and parasites will survive and be consumed. This can make you very sick.
One parasite found in pork is  Trichinella spiralis , a roundworm which causes an infection called  trichinosis , also known as trichinellosis. Other animals, like wolves, boars, bears, and walruses, can also be carriers of this roundworm ( 1 ,  2 ).
What’s more, eating rare or raw pork also puts you at risk of certain tapeworms,  Taenia solium  or  Taenia  asiatica,  entering your digestive tract and reproducing. These lead to infections, like taeniasis or cysticercosis ( 3 ,  4 ).
Thus, eating rare or undercooked pork is not considered safe.
To diminish the risk of developing these infections, you should always cook your pork to the appropriate temperature.
Eating raw or undercooked pork can make you very sick and put you at risk for parasites like roundworm or tapeworms. These are typically killed in the cooking process — which is why it’s crucial to cook your pork thoroughly.

Symptoms of eating contaminated pork
Symptoms of trichinosis can emerge within 1 to 2 days of consuming the contaminated, undercooked pork — but may not show for up to a week after ingestion ( 5 ).
Once the larvae enter your digestive system and begin to reproduce on days 5 to 7, you may experience gastrointestinal upset, with symptoms like nausea,  vomiting , diarrhea, fatigue, and abdominal cramps ( 5 ).
Then, a week to several weeks after ingestion, the larvae begin to burrow themselves into muscle and intestinal walls.
In this phase, symptoms like a high fever, muscle ache, light sensitivity, eye infections, facial swelling, rashes, headaches, and chills are common ( 5 ).
Trichinosis can sometimes lead to more serious complications, affecting the heart or the brain. While these complications are rare, they can be fatal. With adequate medical treatment, most will recover from trichinosis in about 8 weeks ( 5 ).
On the other hand,  tapeworm-related infections  like taeniasis or cysticercosis are a bit trickier to diagnose as tapeworms don’t cause immediate symptoms and often go unrecognized.
Tapeworms can be detected about 2 to 3 months after ingestion of contaminated meat by means of a series of stool samples.
If symptoms of taeniasis do develop, they usually include:
unexplained weight loss
digestive problems
pain
irritation around the anal area
blockage of the intestine
However, if you suddenly experience seizures, this is one of the symptoms of cysticercosis. This means the tapeworm has traveled to other areas of the body like the brain, eye, or heart ( 4 ).
If you’re experiencing any of these symptoms, seek prompt medical attention.
Those with a compromised immune system should be especially vigilant about following food safety guidelines and cooking pork to an appropriate temperature.
This includes those who are pregnant, undergoing cancer therapy, or on certain medications which suppress the immune system.
Additionally, people living with HIV, AIDS, diabetes, or those who have received an organ transplant should be especially careful about where their food is coming from and that it’s being properly prepared.
Symptoms of trichinosis can include nausea, abdominal cramps, and, later, muscle pains, facial swelling, and high fevers. Tapeworms may not cause symptoms but can still make you sick and even cause sudden seizures.

Changes in practices
Due to improved agricultural practices in the United States, Canada, and Europe in the last several decades, developing trichinosis has become rare ( 5 ,  6 ).
In fact, from 2011–2015, an average of 16 cases of trichinosis were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States each year ( 6 , 7 ).
Worldwide trichinosis estimates are much greater — at 10,000 cases each year — most stemming from China and Southeast Asian or Eastern European countries ( 5 ,  6 ).
Pork-related tapeworm cases are harder to discern, but globally it’s estimated that 28,000 deaths per year can be attributed to these parasites ( 4 ).
However, it’s worth keeping in mind that practices in the United States are still evolving.
On October 1, 2019, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced it would reduce the number of its inspectors on site and allow pork manufacturers to inspect their pork products themselves. These measures went into effect just 2 months later ( 8 ).
Previously, only government inspectors could determine which pork products looked safe enough to be sold to the public ( 8 ).
While it’s too soon to understand the effect of this key change, it could represent less oversight. Therefore, thoroughly cooking your pork remains crucial.
Changes to agricultural practices over past decades in the United States have made pork safer to eat. However, these have recently changed, allowing for less oversight. Either way, it’s still important to avoid eating undercooked pork.

General tips to keep you safe
You won’t be able to tell if your pork is infected with  Trichinella spirals  or pork tapeworms just by looking at it, since these larvae are microscopic in size. Therefore, the best defense against trichinosis is  cooking your pork thoroughly .
Trichinae is killed at 137°F (58°C), while tapeworm eggs and larvae are killed between 122–149°F (50–65°C) ( 5 ,  9 ,  10 ).
One study found that pork tapeworm eggs and larvae could be killed at a lower temperature of 122°F (50°C) for roasts that bake over 15–20 minutes, but higher temperatures of over 149°F (65°C) were needed for dishes with ground pork mixes ( 9 ,  10 ).
In the United States, experts recommend cooking pork until its  internal temperature  reaches 145°F (63°C) for chops, steaks, and loins. For ground pork, organ meats, or ground meat mixes, cook to at least 160°F (71°C) ( 11 ).
Whether it’s a loin or ground pork, you should let the meat rest for 3 minutes before consuming. This allows the meat to continue to cook and rise in temperature.
When cooked to 145°F (63°C), you may notice the white meat has a hint of pink as you slice into it. According to the revised guidelines from the USDA, this is acceptable.
You should use a calibrated thermometer to take the temperature of your meats, and follow the manufacturer’s guidelines.
Proper food handling is also really important. This means that handwashing is imperative while you cook, as is using clean drinking water to wash off cutting surfaces, dishes, or utensils.

Cooking your pork to a safe temperature is crucial to avoid infection. While pork loins, chops, and steaks should be cooked to 145°F (63°C), ground pork should reach at least 160°F (71°C). Allow your meat to rest 3 minutes before eating.

The bottom line
Eating raw or undercooked pork is not a good idea. The meat can harbor parasites, like roundworms or tapeworms.
These can cause foodborne illnesses like trichinosis or  taeniasis . While rare, trichinosis can lead to serious complications that are sometimes fatal. Those with compromised immune systems should be especially careful.
Although improvements in agricultural practices have made certain infections less likely, it’s still advisable to practice proper food handling and cook your pork to a recommended temperature.
In this way, you can cook pork that isn’t only delicious but safe to eat.
