BOTTOM LINE: The South Beach Diet is a lower carb diet that may help you lose weight, reduce insulin levels, and protect heart health. However, the diet may be restrictive and allows processed vegetable oils, which may pose health risks.

What is the South Beach Diet?
The  South Beach Diet  was created in the mid-1990s by Dr. Arthur Agatston, a Florida-based cardiologist. His work in heart disease research led to the development of the Agatston score, which measures the amount of calcium in the coronary arteries.
According to published interviews, Dr. Agatston observed that patients on the Atkins Diet were  losing weight  and belly fat, while those on low-fat, high-carb diets were struggling to achieve results.
However, he was uncomfortable with the high amount of saturated fat allowed on the Atkins Diet, especially for people with heart disease. In addition, he didn’t believe in restricting high-fiber foods with “good carbs,” like fruit and whole grains.
Dr. Agatston wanted to create a diet that allowed overweight, diabetic and prediabetic individuals to easily lose weight and reduce their risk of heart disease.
Therefore, he developed the South Beach Diet, which is rich in low-glycemic-index carbs, lean proteins and unsaturated fats.
After losing weight and  belly fat  when he tried the diet out on himself, he began prescribing it to his patients, who reported similar results.
Dr. Agatston’s book  The South Beach Diet  was published in 2003 and became a bestseller around the world. An updated version called  The South Beach Diet Supercharged  was published in 2009 and also became a worldwide bestseller.
The South Beach Diet is a lower-carb diet that emphasizes lean meats, unsaturated fats and low-glycemic-index carbs. It was created by cardiologist Dr. Arthur Agatston.

How does the South Beach Diet work?
The South Beach Diet has three different phases: two for weight loss and a third for weight maintenance.
Phase 1 lasts 14 days.
It’s considered the strictest phase because it limits fruit, grains and other higher-carb foods in order to decrease blood sugar and insulin levels, stabilize hunger and reduce cravings.
Most people can expect to lose 8–13 pounds (3.5–6 kg) of body weight during this phase.
During phase 1, you consume three meals per day composed of lean protein, non-starchy vegetables and small amounts of healthy fat and  legumes .
In addition, you consume two mandatory snacks per day, preferably a combination of lean protein and vegetables.
This phase begins on day 15 and should be maintained for as many weeks as necessary to achieve your goal weight.
You can expect to lose 1–2 pounds (0.5–1 kg) per week during this phase, on average.
During phase 2, all foods from phase 1 are allowed, plus limited portions of fruit and “good carbs,” such as whole grains and certain types of alcohol.
Once you achieve your target weight, you advance to phase three.
In this stage, although the phase-2 guidelines should be the basis for your lifestyle, occasional treats are allowed and no foods are truly off limits.
However, if you overindulge and start putting on weight, Dr. Agatston recommends returning to phase 1 for one to two weeks before returning to phase three.
In  The South Beach Diet Supercharged , Dr. Agatston also recommends regular  exercise  and provides a three-phase fitness program to accompany the diet phases.
The South Beach Diet consists of three phases: a low-carb phase for rapid weight loss, a less restrictive phase for more gradual weight loss and a third phase for weight maintenance.

Benefits of the South Beach Diet
There are several benefits of the South Beach diet, including its ability to produce weight loss without  hunger .
Research, including an analysis of 24 studies, has consistently shown that high-protein,  low-carb diets  are effective for weight loss ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ).
Part of this is due to protein’s ability to increase your metabolic rate. In addition, protein helps modify hormone levels that reduce hunger and promote fullness, so you end up naturally eating less ( 5 ,  6 ,  7 ).
What’s more, gradually adding small amounts of healthy carbs back into your diet may promote continued weight loss in some people and make it easier for them to stick to the diet long-term.
In one study, overweight and obese people with metabolic syndrome followed the South Beach Diet for 12 weeks ( 8 ).
By the end of the study, they had lost 11 pounds (5.2 kg) and 2 inches (5.1 cm) from around their waists, on average. They also experienced significant decreases in fasting insulin and an increase in the fullness hormone CCK.
The South Beach Diet encourages a high intake of fatty fish like salmon and other foods that fight inflammation, such as leafy greens and cruciferous veggies.
In addition, it recommends dieters regularly consume  eggs , nuts, seeds,  extra virgin olive oil  and other foods that have been shown to protect heart health.
The book makes meal planning easy and pleasurable by providing two weeks of sample menus and recipes for each phase. There are also hundreds of  recipes  available online for phase 1 and phase 2 meals.
The South Beach Diet may help you lose weight and belly fat, reduce insulin levels, increase hormone levels that promote fullness and help protect heart health.

Downsides of the South Beach Diet
Unfortunately, the South Beach Diet also has a couple of drawbacks.
The main issue is that it may be overly restrictive with respect to the amounts and types of fats allowed.
In addition, it allows potentially harmful types of fat, such as soybean oil and safflower oil, which are extremely high in omega-6 fatty acids.
Although it’s important to get some omega-6 fats in your diet, if you’re like most people, you probably already get  far more than you need .
In contrast, if you eat a Western Diet, it’s likely you get too little of the anti-inflammatory omega-3 fats found in fatty fish like  salmon , sardines and mackerel.
Consuming a high ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats has been linked to inflammation, heart disease and other health problems ( 9 ,  10 ,  11 ,  12 ).
In contrast, butter and coconut oil aren’t included on the South Beach Diet because they are high in saturated fat.
However, coconut oil has been credited with several health benefits, including weight loss, a reduction in belly fat and better heart health markers in overweight and obese adults ( 13 ,  14 ).
In addition, most comprehensive reviews of studies have found no association between saturated fat intake and an increased risk of heart disease ( 15 ,  16 ,  17 ).
On the other hand, other large reviews have found that replacing a portion of saturated fat with unsaturated fat could potentially reduce the risk of heart disease ( 18 ,  19 ).
Overall, choosing less processed fat and eating plenty of fish high in  omega-3 fats  may be more important for heart health than restricting saturated fat.
The South Beach Diet may be overly restrictive by prohibiting many saturated fat sources and limiting fat intake overall. In addition, it allows the use of processed vegetable oils.

Is the South Beach Diet safe and sustainable?
The South Beach Diet  is a healthy way of eating that is far lower in carbs than conventional low-fat diets. It also encourages dieters to eat mainly unprocessed foods, liberal amounts of vegetables and healthy, high-fiber carb sources.
However, the diet allows processed vegetable oils, which could pose health risks. Nevertheless, you can avoid this drawback by choosing unprocessed monounsaturated fats like extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil or macadamia oil instead.
All this being said, the South Beach Diet is likely a sustainable way of eating.
Many people have reported losing weight and keeping it off by following the diet.
Yet in the end, the most effective diet for weight loss is whichever one you can easily stick with long-term.
