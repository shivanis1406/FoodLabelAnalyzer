Title: What Is Arrowroot, and How Is It Used?

Arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea) is a tropical tuber native to Indonesia. It’s often processed into flour and used in baking, cooking, and around the house.
This vegetable is mostly employed in the kitchen, as it works well in sweet and savory dishes alike. Some proponents claim that it may have medicinal properties as well.
Aside from being high in protein and several nutrients, arrowroot is very easy to digest. This makes it a good choice for children and older adults.
This article reviews the nutrients, benefits, and uses of arrowroot.

Nutritional profile
Arrowroot is a  starchy root vegetable  similar to yam, cassava, sweet potato, and taro.
Like many starches, it’s high in carbohydrates. It also contains a range of important micronutrients like folate, phosphorus, and potassium.
A 1-cup (120-gram) serving of sliced, raw arrowroot  contains :
Arrowroot has a higher protein content than other tubers, packing 5 grams per 1 cup (120 grams), compared with just  2.3 grams  in the same amount of yam.
It’s also rich in folate (vitamin B9), which is essential for development during pregnancy and DNA formation. Low levels of this vitamin are associated with an  increased risk  of birth defects, namely neural tube defects.

Potential benefits of arrowroot
Historically, arrowroot has been used for its medicinal properties. Most of its potential health benefits are linked to its starch content and composition.
However, it’s important to note that there’s limited evidence supporting these health claims.
Arrowroot powder contains resistant starch, which your body cannot digest. It forms a viscous gel when mixed with water and behaves like soluble fiber in your gut.
Foods high in fiber and resistant starch slow your rate of digestion, giving you a  prolonged feeling of fullness . In turn, this may regulate your appetite and aid in weight loss. However,  research  has shown that appetite management is highly dependent on the amount of resistant starch you consume.
Arrowroot’s protein content may aid feelings of fullness as well.
Arrowroot may help with diarrhea both by firming stool.
Arrowroot’s  high starch content  may be responsible, as it helps increase stool consistency and size. In turn, this reduces the frequency of bowel movements.
However, there’s limited research on using arrowroot powder for diarrhea.
Like most tubers, arrowroot is naturally gluten-free. Its powder can be used as a  substitute for wheat flour .
Those who have  celiac disease  — a common digestive disorder in which gluten inflames your small intestine — need to completely avoid this gluten. This includes grains like barley, wheat, and rye.
Arrowroot’s resistant starch is especially useful for gluten-free products. It helps improve their texture, crispness, and flavor, so it’s a popular choice for gluten-free baking.

Uses for arrowroot
Though you can cook the root itself, arrowroot is more frequently consumed as a powder.
It’s used as a thickening agent for sauces, puddings, and jellies, as well as an ingredient in baked goods like cookies and cakes. Additionally, it’s a popular replacement for wheat flour in gluten-free recipes.
It may have several cosmetic applications due to its alleged oil-absorbing capacity. However, they’re not necessarily supported by scientific evidence.
Some uses for arrowroot powder include:
Dry shampoo:  You can massage arrowroot powder into your scalp to refresh your hair without water.
Deodorant ingredient:  To make homemade deodorant, you can mix equal parts arrowroot powder,  coconut oil , and baking soda.
Talcum powder substitute:  On its own, arrowroot powder may absorb moisture and increase smoothness. As with any other talcum powders, these should never be used on a baby because of the risk of severe lung damage.

Substitutes for arrowroot powder
If you run out of arrowroot powder, you  can try  one of these substitutes — all of which are gluten-free:
Cornstarch:  This common ingredient can be used for both culinary and cosmetic purposes. Use 1 tablespoon of  cornstarch  for every 2 teaspoons of arrowroot.
Tapioca flour:  This popular gluten-free flour is similar in flavor to arrowroot. For every 1 teaspoon of arrowroot, use 1 tablespoon of  tapioca flour .
Potato starch:  Arrowroot and potato starch contain similar amounts of amylose, a starch compound that acts as a thickener. Use 1 teaspoon of potato starch for every 2 teaspoons of arrowroot.
Rice flour:  Arrowroot and rice flour have very similar carbohydrate content, but rice flour is higher in starch. When swapping it with arrowroot, use only half as much.

The bottom line
Arrowroot is a  root vegetable  often sold as a powder. It’s used as a thickening agent and gluten-free flour.
There are also some potential health benefits are associated with its starch content. While research is limited, it may aid in  weight loss  and help with diarrhea.
