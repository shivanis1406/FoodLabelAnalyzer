Massage therapy is a popular way to reduce muscle strain and pain.
That said, you don’t have to go to a professional to see results. Percussive massagers — also known as massage guns — provide short bursts of pressure into your muscle tissue.
As a result, they help  reduce muscle soreness  and  improve joint and muscle mobility .
We’ve rounded up the best massage guns after talking with a variety of physical therapists and trainers about the ones they personally use and recommend.
Generally, prices range from $39.99–$599. But this varies depending on where you shop.
General price ranges with dollar signs ($–$$$) are indicated below. One dollar sign means the massage gun is rather affordable, whereas three dollar signs indicate a higher cost.
Pricing guide:

The Renpho Power Thermacool is one of the best massage guns on the market today. It offers long battery life, a wide range of speeds, and numerous attachments for different massage techniques.

This massage gun can deliver up to 50 pounds (lb) of massage intensity at a relatively quiet volume of 45 decibels or less. You can also use the companion app for mobile devices to choose from different massage techniques for your specific needs.

Healthline Editor Kristin Curran-Sheehan recommends the Renpho Power Thermacool because it “offers 3-in-1 treatment for aches, injuries, or chronic pain maintenance. I manage  fibromyalgia  and  trapezius myalgia , and [the heated percussion of the Thermacool] obliterated the resistance out of my trapezius muscles … on level 1.”
She also appreciated the user-centered design of this massage gun.
“I’ve had other massage guns and I appreciate Renpho’s considerations of the user,” she said.
“The Power ThermaCool Massage Gun has a 10-minute timer for heat and a 5-minute timer for cool, which are around the  recommended time frames  for massage guns so as not to overexert a muscle.
“And it’s lightweight. So if you manage chronic pain like me, hoisting a gun in an awkward position to hit a muscle can be just as injurious if it’s heavy.”
She also has high praise for the mobile app that can be used with the massage gun.
“It’s super intuitive and you can control the settings on your mobile device when it may be too difficult to adjust while using on the massage gun itself.”

The  Theragun Elite  is a favorite among chiropractors, athletes, and casual exercisers. It features a powerful motor and five attachable heads for targeted  muscle relief .
The device offers five speed options, allowing you to dig deep or go lighter on more sensitive areas.
It’s also quieter than many other massage guns. Plus, it weighs just 2.2 lb, or 1 kilogram (kg). This makes it easy to pack in your gym bag.
Dr. Melissa Prestipino , PT, DPT, owner of Maize & Blue Rehab in Sparta, New Jersey, said, “The Theragun Elite offers a very quiet percussive force, which is quieter than other massage guns on the market. This feature is beneficial when using the device in a public place and not wanting to draw attention with a loud sound.”
She also called out its easy-to-grip ergonomic design, which she says makes it more comfortable for people with hand and wrist issues, such as arthritis.
“The triangular handle allows you to hold the device from different positions and angles, setting it apart from the typical massage gun shape,” she said.

The Theragun PRO is a good option for serious athletes and the best massage gun for runners. It offers several speeds and attachments for a deep and  powerful massage .
The PRO stands out from others on the market due to its ergonomic grip and adjustable head. This allows you to apply this percussion massager at different angles without tiring your hand.
Using Bluetooth capabilities, you can also connect the Theragun PRO to the Therabody app for personalized wellness routines.
Additionally, it comes with two rechargeable batteries so that you can charge one while the other is in use.
However, the Theragun PRO is one of the most expensive massage guns on the market, making it a candidate for the best splurge on the list.
Natasha Caleel , a licensed occupational therapist and corrective exercise specialist, uses it with clients regularly and finds it to be a great option for athletes at all levels as well as those trying to reduce muscle tension after a tough day at work.
“The rotating arm makes it easier to get to those hard-to-reach places, especially when using it on yourself,” she said. However, Caleel points out that the vibration and weight can make it hard to use on yourself for extended periods.

The Hyperice Hypervolt Go 2 is a sleek, compact massage gun that’s easy to take with you anywhere. It has a higher price point than some larger massage guns, but it’s simple to use and doesn’t have a lot of frills or fuss.

It’s also one of the quietest massage guns on our list and it’s easy to charge with an included USB charger cable, so you can quickly charge it using a laptop or even a portable charger while at your meet, game, or tournament.


Student athlete “Garrett” recommends this massage gun for athletes who need a device to help themselves recover while they travel.
“This massage gun is really compact, and for its size, it still has lots of power. The battery is relatively long lasting, and it doesn’t take long to fully charge.”
He also notes that it’s easy to use the different attachments on the massage gun: “It’s easy to change out the two different tips and the bullet.”
He did have a few critiques to share with potential buyers.
“The lights on the bottom [indicating charge life] are difficult to see outside,” he says, “and the massage gun does not come with a carrying case or bag.”
But overall, Garrett felt comfortable with this massage gun and the brand as a whole: “Hyperice as a whole is usually a very reliable brand.”

Weighing only 1.5 lb (0.68 kg), the Renpho R3 is a good massage gun if you’re looking for a full-size massage gun that’s still lightweight and easy to carry.
This massage gun features five speeds, comes with a carrying case, and charges using a USB-C cable, which many people find convenient.
The five attachable heads make it easy to target knots in various areas of your body, such as your neck, shoulder blades, or  glutes .
The Renpho R3 is one go-to massage gun for  Amanda Capritto , a certified personal trainer, nutrition coach, and exercise specialist. She said it’s a great option thanks to its compactness, price point, and specs.
Capritto often recommends the Renpho R3 to people who want a gentle but effective massage gun for a reasonable price. If you simply need something basic and lightweight, it’ll get the job done.
“The Renpho R3 does a moderately good job of massaging sore muscles and providing pain relief for most recreational exercisers,” she said.

The Vybe V2 Percussion Massager generates up to 60 lb (27.2 kg) of percussive force to provide a deep, powerful massage. This is comparable to the Theragun PRO but at a fraction of the cost.
“The V2 Percussion Massager is one of the more affordable massage guns on the market. Its multiple grips and 90-degree rotating arm make it easy to use,” said Prestipino. In her experience, the device and carry case are sleeker and less bulky than competitors, making it ideal for travel.
With three attachment heads designed to provide deep tissue relief, the cordless device may help loosen muscle knots, alleviate tension, and improve mobility.
It also offers six intensity levels and a rotating arm so that you can reach most areas of your body.
Just keep in mind that the Vybe V2’s motor is quite noisy.

The Renpho Mini Massage Gun is a compact, portable massage gun that’s still powerful enough to pack a punch.
It features five intensities geared toward warmup,  fascia relief ,  lactic acid breakdown , deep tissue, and professional impact.
The Renpho Mini massage gun is also the lightest weight percussion massager on our list. It runs quietly and has four attachable heads that focus on everyday use, the spinal region, muscle knots, and bony areas.
Plus, thanks to its convenient travel case and lightweight design, this massage gun can be easily stowed away in a backpack, purse, or carry-on.
Prestipino described the Renpho Mini Massage Gun as mini but mighty.
“For a smaller gun, it offers a very effective force to penetrate muscle tissue well. This massage gun is about 1.5 times stronger than most guns its size,” she said.
“The four adjustable massage heads pop on and off very easily. The gun offers a 10-minute auto-off feature that helps the 4-hour battery life last even longer,” she added.

What brand of massage gun is best?

How we chose these massage guns
When looking for the best massage guns, we considered the following criteria:
Power:  We looked for products with 2,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) or more.
Special features:  We considered massage guns with special features, such as attachable heads, carrying cases, lightweight designs, and multiple massage modes.
Customer reviews:  All products on this list have mostly positive customer reviews.
Vetting:  These massage guns have been vetted to ensure they align with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being. You can read more about  our vetting process .

How to choose the best massage gun for you
When shopping for the best massage gun, you’ll want to consider a variety of factors, including:
Intensity:  Do you want an intense deep tissue massage? Or do you need less intensity for more sensitive areas? Look for a massager that offers an optimal amount of power to fit your needs.
Battery life:  While most handheld massage guns are rechargeable, it’s nice to have one with a solid battery life, especially if you plan on using it on the go.
Weight:  If you plan on carrying it with you throughout the day, you’ll want to choose a massage gun that’s compact and lightweight.
Usability:  Some massage guns are easier and more comfortable to use than others. Look for percussive massagers that rotate or have functional grips and handles.
Price:  Percussive massagers can vary greatly in price. It’s important to consider how much you’re willing to spend.

How to use a massage gun
While using a massage gun is fairly straightforward, there are a few important things to know:
Start by massaging the least sensitive areas of your body for short periods.
Massage each area or muscle group for a maximum of 2 minutes.
Avoid massaging major arteries, areas with severe pain, and bony areas—including your spine and joints.
To prevent the massage gun from overheating, always follow the time limit set in place by the manufacturer.
Check with a medical professional before trying a  massage gun on the neck .
Kelsey Decker, NSCA-CPT, education coordinator at  StretchLab , said that she suggests “starting on a lower level of intensity to make sure your body can handle the sensation. You can also increase the intensity by applying more pressure to the area of focus. Spend about 30 seconds to 2 minutes per muscle group area.”
According to Decker, you can use a massage gun before a workout to alleviate tightness and activate your muscles before heading into a dynamic warmup and then your workout. You can also use it for post-exercise recovery to help release tension.
That said,  more research  is needed to determine whether using a massage gun before or after workouts is more beneficial and which speeds and durations are most effective.

When to avoid using a massage gun
To ensure safety, Decker recommends focusing on muscle and fascia while avoiding bones, tendons, joints, and  ligaments .
According to Decker, you’ll also want to avoid using a massage gun:
on joint, disk, or bone injuries
on metal screws, implants, or pins
if you have excessive pain, inflammation, or an acute injury
if you have a pacemaker
if you have vertigo
Finally, talk with a healthcare professional before using a massage gun, especially if you have any medical conditions or take medications.
A professional can also advise you on the best practices if you’re healing from an injury or surgery.

Alternatives to using a massage gun
Several alternatives to massage guns provide comparable benefits. You can use these methods individually, in combination, and with massage gun therapy.
Massage gun alternatives include:
Professional massage:  A massage from a licensed therapist is one of the best ways to relieve muscle tension. For affordable options, search for community clinics, massage schools, and businesses offering a sliding scale.
Fascial counterstrain:  This type of  manual therapy  involves manipulating tissues, muscles, bones, nerves, blood vessels, and even organs to reduce pain.
Self-massage:  Use your  fingers, knuckles, and palms  to release tension using kneading and circular motions. You can also press directly on trigger points for a short time.
Topical products:  Use  topical products , such as massage oil, CBD balm, and analgesic ointment, to reduce friction and make applying pressure easier during a self-massage.
Gua sha:  This traditional  Chinese healing technique  uses a tool to apply pressure to acupressure points and scrape your skin. Tools come in different shapes to target specific areas of the body. They’re small enough to toss in your bag to use on the go. Professional sessions are available, often from acupuncturists.
Massage tools:   Foam rollers , tennis balls, and massage balls can help release tension in specific areas.
Stretches:  A simple stretching routine is an effective way to alleviate tightness.
Cold therapy:  Use ice packs, cold compresses, or  cold plunge  to reduce inflammation, swelling, and tension.
Heat therapy:  Hot packs,  heating pads , and hot baths can help relax muscles and relieve pain.
Electrical stimulation:  A  TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation)  device can stimulate muscles and promote relaxation.
Acupressure mats:  These mats have tiny spikes that apply  acupressure to specific points  on your body, enhancing relaxation and reducing muscle tension.

Frequently asked questions about massage guns
According to a  2023 review  of 13 studies, massage guns can be beneficial for relieving muscle stiffness and soreness from physical activity and daily life.
They boost blood flow to your muscles, which promotes healing, improves workout recovery, and enhances muscle function. The devices may also help improve flexibility, increase range of motion, and break up scar tissue that can cause stiffness and reduce mobility.
Massage guns can also help promote relaxation, mindfulness, and body awareness. Focusing on the sensations in your body encourages  present-moment awareness . This can be beneficial for managing anxiety,  reducing rumination , and identifying areas of tension.
You can use a massage gun anytime, as long as you do gentle stretches and exercises to warm up your muscles beforehand. You may prefer to use it in the morning to energize yourself for the day ahead and in the evening to relax and unwind.

Decker pointed out that massage guns are not a substitute for stretching, but she said you could use the tool with stretching to ease muscle tension in tight spots or areas of concern.
“[A] massage gun can help the group of muscles relax before transitioning into a stretch for the same muscle groups,” Decker said.
“For example, if you have  tight hips  and it’s difficult to get them to loosen up while stretching, use the massage gun device for 30 seconds to 1 minute and then go back to stretching your hips.”

Using a massage gun during pregnancy may provide similar benefits to prenatal massage. A  2021 research review  suggests that relaxing massage during pregnancy may help alleviate pain, boost mood, and improve sleep.
However, during your first trimester, it’s best to avoid using a massage gun or having any type of massage since this may increase your risk of miscarriage.
Once you enter the second trimester, it’s likely safe to use a massage gun as long as you talk with a healthcare professional beforehand. While using a massage gun, you can sit or lie on your left side. Do not lie on your stomach. Avoid lying on your back for any length of time.
Avoid massaging your abdominal area. Do not use strong pressure, especially on your legs.
Massage during pregnancy  may not be suitable for people with:

The best budget massage gun is the Vybe V2 Percussion Massager. The user-friendly design is powerful enough to provide deep tissue massage, offering plenty of value for the price.
As long as you can tolerate the noise, the Vybe V2 Percussion Massager is a good option if you only plan to use it occasionally or want to try out a massage gun before investing in a high end model.
It’s wise to be wary of massage guns that are considerably cheaper than the competition. They may wear out quickly and have a heavy, bulky design.
