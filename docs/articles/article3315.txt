Our  Medical Standards and Insights team  has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline.
To choose the products on this page, we considered all the multivitamins that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further.
Bodies have different needs. Folks assigned male at birth often need more of some nutrients and less of others than folks assigned female at birth do.
For example, people who don’t menstruate have a lower risk of iron deficiency anemia. So, they have  lower iron needs .
While most people can meet their nutrient needs through diet alone, some may need supplements, especially if they have dietary restrictions or issues with nutrient absorption.
For example, older adults have a greater risk of deficiencies in several nutrients, including  vitamin B12  and  vitamin D .
However, figuring out which multivitamin to choose can be confusing. Keep reading to see which product might be right for you.

Garden of Life Organics Men’s Multi is worth considering for men who want a simple, high quality multivitamin to help cover their nutritional bases.
Specifically, we like that the product contains whole foods-based ingredients, all of which are certified organic by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and is designed to be easy on the stomach.
The organic men’s formula contains 17 essential vitamins and minerals, including all eight B vitamins and more than 100% of the DV for vitamin D. It’s also formulated with a proprietary blend of fruits, vegetables, and herbal extracts.
In addition to being certified organic, this multivitamin is certified vegan and gluten-free as well as non-GMO verified.
According to the company, all Garden of Life products are third-party tested for purity and potency, though the name of the testing organization isn’t disclosed.
Healthline team member Jacob Moore took this multivitamin with his lunch every day for 2 weeks. According to Moore, “Over that time frame, I didn’t notice any major differences in how I felt, which was not surprising to me as I already eat a healthy diet that provides good nutrients.
“However, I did notice that it was incredibly easy to take the supplement, and I enjoyed the peace of mind that came with knowing I was getting some extra vitamins and minerals on days when I wasn’t able to hit my desired vegetable and fruit intake.”

Healthline team member Luke Sheppard shared that he was interested in taking mindbodygreen ultimate multivitamin + because of “the quantity of vitamins, minerals, and supplements contained within each serving.”
Sheppard noted that the bottle arrived in good condition and the capsules were easy to swallow without any bad taste or aftertaste.
“ Each serving is two capsules, and I swallowed both simultaneously and never had any difficulty swallowing or discomfort in my throat,” he said.
According to Sheppard, the only con he’s noticed so far is the cost.
“The price of this product is similar, but ultimately more expensive, than nearly all competitor products. That said, it also includes more vitamins, minerals, and supplements than competitor products with 33 different ingredients,” he said.

Nature Made for Him is one the best multivitamins for men on a budget. In addition to being verified by the  United States Pharmacopeia (USP) , this affordable supplement contains 22 essential vitamins and minerals, without any added herbs or superfoods.
We also like how easy it is to find both in-store and online.
One potential downside: It includes forms of  magnesium  and  zinc  that are not as readily absorbed as others.

According to Healthline team member Carson Pledger, “ I live a busy lifestyle and don’t always have time to make sure I am getting all the different nutrients I need in the foods I eat or make. My goal with taking this product was to make sure I’m not missing anything crucial that my body needs.”
Pledger reported that the bottle arrived in good condition, and the vitamins didn’t have a noticeable taste or aftertaste.
While he had only been taking the multivitamin for a little over 2 weeks at the time of his review, Pledger stated, “ Nature Made Multi For Him is a great value product that offers everything I know to look for in a multivitamin at a good price point.
“It does not have any extra bells or whistles, but [it] has higher concentrations of many of the same vitamins I see in similar products.”

For fitness enthusiasts, getting enough nutrients in your daily diet is crucial. In fact, micronutrients  are needed  for everything from energy production to muscle growth, recovery, and more, which could be especially important if you’re physically active.

This complete multivitamin from Transparent Labs features a blend of 19 vitamins and minerals and is formulated specifically for active adults.

It also includes ashwagandha extract, a medicinal herb that  may benefit  physical performance.

Furthermore, it’s third-party tested and certified by  Informed Choice , an organization that evaluates the safety and purity of supplements.
Read more information on the brand in our  full Transparent Labs review .


Healthline team member Jacob Moore started taking the Transparent Lab Multivitamin to improve his general health and ensure that all of his nutritional bases were covered.

Initially, he was surprised at the recommended serving size of four capsules per day.
“However, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the pills are incredibly easy to swallow and that I could take the entire serving with one sip of water,” he said.

At just $1 per day, Moore was pleased with the price of this multivitamin and even experienced some positive effects after starting supplementation, including an uptick in his energy levels.

“I tried this supplement as a basic ‘coverall’ for my nutrition but found that I really enjoyed it and prefer it over other multivitamins I’ve used. This has been my favorite multi I’ve tried and will be my go-to in the future,” Moore said.

These mint-enhanced capsules from  Ritual  are designed to help bridge nutrient gaps in men 18 years and older and are our choice as the best multivitamin for young men in their 20s and 30s.
Each one-capsule serving contains the recommended DV for vitamin B12 and vitamin D as well as smaller amounts of other nutrients, such as vitamin E and zinc.
This supplement also contains the omega-3 fatty acid  docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) , which has been shown to support heart health.
Ritual’s men’s formula provides 330 milligrams (mg) of omega-3 DHA per dose. But some  research  suggests that higher doses may be necessary to support heart health.
Ritual products are processed in facilities that are certified by  NSF International  and meet the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations set by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
They are also third-party tested by  Eurofins  and  IEH Laboratories .
Just keep in mind that Ritual multivitamins are designed to only provide a few key nutrients and aren’t as comprehensive as others on our list.
Healthline contributor  Joe Capraro  reported an overall positive experience with Ritual’s multivitamin.
“I was very satisfied with these — definitely a product I’d consider using in the future.
“I had been experiencing mild anemia prior to taking these vitamins, and the B12 and folate content seemed to help bring my  hemoglobin  and iron levels back closer to normal range during the 90-day test period [based on blood work].
“A wider range of nutrients would be nice, though. Most multivitamins provide more than the eight [nutrients that] this one supplies. As someone with  celiac disease , I did appreciate that these capsules were gluten-free (they are also vegan).”

Smarty Pants Men’s Formula is a chewable fruity multivitamin, which contains 17 essential nutrients for men and is a good option for men who dislike swallowing pills.
One serving of these multivitamin gummies contains 9 grams (g) of carbs and 6 g of added sugar, so if you’re  monitoring your carb intake , this may not be your best option.
SmartyPants products are processed in facilities that meet CGMP standards, and the products are third-party tested for purity and potency. This supplement is also certified by NSF International.
Healthline team member Nick Trull tested a handful of supplements, including this gummy multivitamin.
According to Trull, “I’ve enjoyed taking the SmartyPants Multivitamin. It’s tasty and easy to consume and has been a fun treat to kick off the day.”
“I’m not sure if it’s the vitamins, but I’ve noticed increased energy. For someone who is not as keen to pills, it has been a great and tasty alternative.
“The only downside is the recommendation for six gummies, rather than one or two, a day.”

Pure Encapsulations Men’s Nutrients is formulated to support key areas of health for men over age 40, including eye, heart, bone, and prostate health.

It’s also notably high in  B vitamins , which may help boost energy levels if you’re not getting adequate amounts of these vitamins from your diet.

This supplement is also a good option for people who have certain dietary concerns or gluten-related disorders: It’s gluten-free, vegetarian-friendly, and free of wheat, soy, dairy, eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, GMOs, and artificial colors, flavors, and sweeteners.

Just keep in mind that one serving contains only 12.5 micrograms (mcg), or 500 international units (IU), of vitamin D. That’s 63% of the DV for vitamin D, which may not be enough for some people.

According to the company, all Pure Encapsulations products are rigorously tested, both in house and by third-party labs, to ensure purity and potency. Products and manufacturing processes are also audited twice per year by NSF International.

Healthline team member Douglas Backstrom shared that as someone who is particular about the foods and supplements he takes, he was curious to see how this option from Pure Encapsulations stacked up.
At the time of his review, Backstrom had been taking the pills daily for 8 days.
“ The size of the capsules is pretty large! But I also take three fish oil pills at once, and those are large, too. If you’re not used to swallowing large pills or have difficulty with them, it’s best to consider taking them one at a time or separate intervals.
“Still, these should be taken with food because it may cause nausea. One serving size for Pure Encapsulations is three pills twice a day; I take these with my breakfast and lunch,” he said.
Backstrom also noted there’s a bit of an aftertaste, so you’ll want to swallow them quickly.
When asked about his overall thoughts about Pure Encapsulations Men’s Nutrients, Backstrom said, “ This seems to be a good product, though I’d need to take it for more than a week to be sure. However, this product is more than a basic complex vitamin. The product comes with an extensive ingredients list and seems most suitable for active individuals.”

A comparison of the best multivitamins for men
Here’s a quick look at how our top picks compare:

How to choose a multivitamin for men
Before starting a new supplement, you can talk with a healthcare professional about any nutritional gaps you may need to fill, as well as any supplements you may need to avoid.
They may recommend a single nutrient, rather than a multivitamin, depending on your current intake.
When deciding which multivitamin is right for you, consider factors such as:
Percentage of the Daily Value (DV):  It’s OK to choose a multivitamin that has less than 100% of the DV for some nutrients, especially if you regularly consume them in your diet. However, if you have nutrient deficiencies, it’s important to choose a product that contains higher doses of these nutrients. It’s wise to talk with a healthcare professional for specific dosing recommendations.
Quality:  Look for seals from organizations such as  USP  and  NSF  on product packaging, which indicate that a product has been third-party tested for quality and accurate labeling.
Allergies:  Always check the ingredient label for potential allergens such as dairy, gluten, or fish, if these are a concern for you.
Specific health concerns:  Based on your specific health concerns, you can talk with a healthcare professional about whether there are certain nutrients you should look for or avoid in a multivitamin.
Form:  Look for a multivitamin in the form you’re most comfortable taking, such as swallowable capsules, dissolvable tablets, liquid, or gummies.
Dosage:  If you often forget to take your vitamins, choose one that you’ll need to take just once per day.
Budget:  Consider the price per serving when determining which product best fits your budget.
Expiration dates:  Check expiration dates to make sure the product is still at its best.

Which vitamins should men take daily?
When choosing a multivitamin, it’s important to pay attention to the nutrients it contains.
Micronutrient needs are highly personal and vary by age and sex. Chronic health conditions and medications can also affect micronutrient needs.
However, adult men generally need to make sure to get enough of the  following vitamins and minerals :
Vitamin A:  necessary for skin, eye, and immune health
B vitamins:  involved in energy metabolism and red blood cell production
Vitamin C:  essential for the immune system and  collagen production
Vitamin D:  important for bone, dental, immune, and  prostate health
Calcium, magnesium, and vitamin K:  vital for bone health
Vitamin E and selenium:  antioxidants that help protect cells from damage
Magnesium and  potassium :  regulate blood pressure and heart and muscle contraction and promote cardiovascular health
As men age, vitamin B12 also becomes harder to absorb, and a supplement may be necessary.
Several multivitamins for men may contain other vitamins, minerals, herbs, or antioxidants that  could be beneficial for prostate health .
For example, saw palmetto and beta-sitosterol are commonly included in men’s supplements.
These two substances  may help support  prostate health and manage urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostate hyperplasia, or enlargement of the prostate gland. Still, more research is needed.
Though supplementing with certain nutrients and plant compounds may benefit prostate health, taking high doses of vitamin E may have the opposite effect.
Keep in mind that some nutrients and herbs may not be recommended for certain people or may have negative interactions with medications. Always consult a healthcare professional before adding a new supplement to your wellness routine.
More research is needed, but  some evidence  suggests that taking high doses of supplemental vitamin E may significantly increase the risk of prostate cancer in healthy men.  Because of this, it’s best to avoid supplements that contain high doses of vitamin E unless it’s specifically recommended by a qualified healthcare professional. If you have questions about the safety of vitamin E supplements, consult a healthcare professional, like a doctor or dietitian, for advice.
While many nutrients are essential, it’s particularly important for men to get enough of certain nutrients:
calcium
magnesium
selenium
all eight B vitamins
vitamins A, C, D, and K
Depending on your diet, you may not need a supplement that contains all these nutrients. Meeting with a registered dietitian or having blood work done by a healthcare professional can help you identify the nutrients to look for when selecting a multivitamin.

Who might need to take a multivitamin?
Multivitamins  are not necessary for everyone, but if you’re unable to meet your nutrient needs through diet alone, a multivitamin could be a good idea.
Men who may benefit from a multivitamin include those with:
dietary restrictions
absorption issues
limited access to nutrient-dense foods
Additionally,  as you age , it becomes harder to get enough of some nutrients, including vitamins B12 and D.
But if you’re already taking dietary supplements, including some protein powders, or regularly consuming  fortified foods , adding a multivitamin to your regimen could lead to an overconsumption of nutrients.
It’s wise to talk with a healthcare professional about whether you could benefit from taking a multivitamin. Depending on your needs, they may advise you to take a single-nutrient supplement instead.

Just remember, it’s important to talk with a healthcare professional first, like a primary care doctor or registered dietitian, especially if you take other prescribed or over-the-counter medications.
