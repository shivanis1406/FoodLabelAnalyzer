Title: Healthy Drinks

In the beginning, there was  water —abundant, refreshing, providing everything the body needs to replenish the fluids it loses. Humans relied on it as the only beverage for millions of years.  Milk  was introduced with the advent of agriculture and the domestication of animals. Then came  beer and wine  and  coffee  and  tea , all consumed for taste and pleasure as much as for the fluids they provide. The newcomers— sugary beverages  including soda,  sports drinks , and  energy drinks —offer hydration but with a hefty dose of unnecessary calories that the body may have a hard time regulating. Alternatively,  “diet” drinks  offer sweetness without the calories, but does that make them a healthy choice?
With so many options, it’s easy to be confused about which beverages are best for our health. Follow the links below for an in-depth look at each, but if you’re short on time, here’s the takeaway:
Water  is the best choice for quenching your thirst.  Coffee  and  tea , without added sweeteners, are healthy choices, too.
Some beverages should be limited or consumed in moderation, including  fruit juice ,  milk , and those made with  low-calorie sweeteners , like diet drinks.  Alcohol  in moderation can be healthy for some people, but not everyone.
It’s generally best to avoid  sugary drinks  like soda,  sports beverages , and  energy drinks .
