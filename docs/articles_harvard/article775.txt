Title: Roasted Squash with Pomegranate

Pomegranate molasses is available in Middle Eastern groceries and also, sometimes, in the imported food section of conventional groceries.
Roasted Squash with Pomegranate
Olive oil for baking tray
4 pounds butternut, delicata, or acorn squash
Up to 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice or lime juice (optional, to taste)
Pomegranate molasses (just a little, for drizzling on top)
Seeds from 1 large pomegranate
Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a baking tray with foil and coat with olive oil.
Slice the squash in half lengthwise . Use kitchen scissors to loosen the seeds, then scrape them out with a spoon and discard them. Peel squash. Cut the peeled squash into 1-inch cubes, and arrange them in a single layer on the prepared tray.
Bake in the center of the oven for 15 to 20 minutes (possibly longer, depending on the type of squash and the thickness of the pieces) or until fork-tender. Try not to let them get mushy, but do make sure they are cooked through.
Transfer to a serving bowl or platter. Taste to see if it wants to be enhanced with lemon or lime juice, and add this in small amounts, as necessary to brighten.
Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature, topped with an artful drizzle of pomegranate molasses and a scattering of pomegranate seeds.
