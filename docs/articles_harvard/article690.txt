Title: Disease Prevention

Chronic diseases —including  heart disease ,  stroke ,  diabetes , and  cancer — account for some of the most common health problems in the United States, according to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Yet many of these chronic diseases are preventable, as they’re linked to poor diet and lifestyle choices including tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, and inadequate physical activity.
The  CDC reports  some sobering statistics about Americans:
Chronic diseases are the leading causes of death and disability.
70% of annual deaths are due to chronic diseases.
These preventable conditions not only compromise quality of life, they add to rising health care costs—75% of our health care dollars are devoted to treat these diseases.
Among adults ages 20 to 74, diabetes remains the leading cause of kidney failure, blindness, and non-traumatic lower-extremity amputations.
The good news is that you have the power to help prevent chronic disease, as making positive diet and lifestyle changes can help reduce risk. Eating  healthy foods , getting enough  exercise , and refraining from tobacco and excessive  alcohol  use confer numerous health benefits—including possibly preventing the onset of chronic diseases.
