Title: Diabetes Prevention Toolkit

Type 2 diabetes is largely preventable by taking  several simple steps : keeping weight under control, exercising more, eating a healthy diet, and not smoking. Yet it is clear that the burden of behavior change cannot fall entirely on individuals. Families, schools, worksites, healthcare providers, communities, media, the food industry, and government must work together to make healthy choices easy choices.
This toolkit offers links to dozens of resources to do just that. Among them are evidence-based guidelines and action plans; research reports and surveillance data; tools for families, schools, healthcare providers, employers, and public health policymakers; case studies that showcase local and state efforts to promote healthy eating and active living; and more. Many of these resources focus on food- and physical activity-related policy changes that can promote healthy environments, encourage healthy behaviors, and ultimately, help turn around the  diabetes epidemic .
