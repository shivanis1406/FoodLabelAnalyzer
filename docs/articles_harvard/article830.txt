3 Cara Cara oranges, cut into segments
2 navel oranges, cut into segments
1 pink grapefruit, cut into segments
¼ cup chopped mint leaves
Combine all ingredients for the dressing in a small mixing bowl and whisk well.
To make beautiful Cara Cara segments, use a sharp knife to cut the top (stem side) and bottom off the fruit. Set the fruit on its bottom and use your knife to cut away the rest of the peel, working from the top to bottom and rotating the fruit as you go until all of the peel has been removed. You want to remove all of the white pith as well. Cut out the segments, leaving behind the membrane that separates the segments. Place the segments in a medium mixing bowl.
Drain off any juice from the segments, and then add the mint and dressing. Use a spoon to mix gently. Serve immediately.
