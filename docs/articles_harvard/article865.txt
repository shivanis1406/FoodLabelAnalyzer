To prepare almond-tomato sauce, sauté olive oil, garlic, and hot pepper flakes until garlic is lightly browned in a medium-sized saucepot. Add the onions to the garlic, and cook onions for 10 to 12 minutes until onions are soft.
Once onions are softened, add the thyme, basil, sugar, capers, and almonds. Hand crush tomatoes and add to the saucepot.
Cook on a low simmer for 10 minutes, stir in almonds, cool, and reserve. This can be done a day ahead.
For cod and littleneck clams, preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and place almond–tomato sauce in bottom of ovenproof casserole dish.
Lightly brush cod with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
Place cod on top of sauce in center of casserole dish with clams around outer edge.
Bake uncovered for 15 to 20 minutes.
