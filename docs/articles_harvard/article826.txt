Title: Portabella Sandwiches with Umami Sauce

Umami is the Japanese term for deliciousness. The umami flavor in certain foods comes from glutamic acid, an amino acid associated with savory or meaty flavors. Mushrooms contain a significant amount of glutamic acid and are considered an umami-rich food. Other umami-rich foods include tomatoes, aged cheeses like Parmeggiano Reggiano, and fermented foods like fish sauce and soy sauce. This recipe aggregates a number of umami-rich foods to create a savory, meat-free sandwich.

Preheat your grill to medium-high.
In a small bowl combine the mayonnaise, soy sauce, and mustard. Set aside
In a medium sauté pan over medium-high heat combine the onions and olive oil. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes, or until onions are brown and have developed caramelized flavor. Add the thyme, cook for additional 30 seconds, remove from heat, and set aside
Brush the portabella mushroom caps with olive oil on both sides. Grill 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until tender.
