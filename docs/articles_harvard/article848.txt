Title: Heart of the Plate, Heart of the Pyramid

Mollie Katzen and Harvard University Dining Services chefs Martin Breslin and Patty Gregory collaborated to create the “Heart of the Plate, Heart of the Pyramid” food station in  Sebastian’s Café  at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The station encourages you to rethink your plate and put the Department of Nutrition’s  healthy eating guidance  into practice: Move away from the traditional mealtime paradigm of a large portion of meat at the center of your plate, and instead build a plate with equal portions of healthy protein (including fish, chicken, and tofu), whole grains, and vegetables.
Try creating a healthy plate at home: Here recipes for some of the most popular vegetable and whole grain dishes from Sebastian’s Café, scaled down to fit the home kitchen.
