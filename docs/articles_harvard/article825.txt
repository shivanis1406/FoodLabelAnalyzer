Cardamom Roasted Cauliflower
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil + 2 teaspoons for oiling the baking dish
1 teaspoon whole cardamom seeds
3 dried red chiles
1 tablespoon coriander seeds
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
½ teaspoon whole black peppercorns
1 2 ½ to 3 pound head of cauliflower, cored and cut into florets
1 medium red onion, peeled, halved and thinly sliced
½ teaspoon kosher salt
Juice from one lemon
Preheat your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Oil a 9”x13” baking dish with 2 teaspoons of olive oil and set aside.
Grind the cardamom, chiles, coriander, cumin, and peppercorns in a coffee grinder or small food processor until fine. Mix the spices with the olive oil in a large mixing bowl.
Add the cauliflower and onions and toss to coat with the spice-oil mixture. Transfer the vegetables to a baking dish and roast until they are tender, about 1 hour, stirring every 20 minutes. Sprinkle with kosher salt and a squeeze of lemon and serve.
