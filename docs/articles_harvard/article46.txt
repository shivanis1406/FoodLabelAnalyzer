Title: French Onion Soup with Beef Broth

French Onion Soup with Beef Broth
1 cup olive oil
4 ounces butter
25 pounds white onions, thinly sliced
1 cup dry sherry or cognac
5 gallons beef stock
4 ounces fresh thyme, chopped
8 ounces chives, chopped
1 ounce black pepper
In a soup pot over medium heat, add butter and oil. When butter is melted, add onions. Cook, stirring occasionally so onions do not burn.
As soon as onions start to brown, approximately 15 minutes, reduce heat to medium-low and stir more often, until onions are a rich brown color, about 45 minutes.
Add sherry or cognac and beef stock. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to simmer. Simmer 20 minutes.
Add thyme, chives, and pepper. Serve.
