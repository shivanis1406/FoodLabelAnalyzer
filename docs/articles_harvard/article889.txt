Title: Guacamole

Guacamole
2 medium avocados
1½ tablespoons freshly-squeezed lime juice
1 garlic clove, minced
2 tablespoon white onion, finely chopped and rinsed
1 to 2 serrano chiles, finely chopped
1 small tomato, cut into a ¼-inch dice
Salt to taste
Cut the avocado in half lengthwise all the way to the pit and then twist the two halves apart. Remove the pit by scooping it out with a spoon and then, with the same spoon, scoop the flesh into a small mixing bowl.
Mash the avocado with a fork to a coarse puree, and then add the lime juice and garlic.
Stir in the onion, tomato, and chili. Taste and season with salt.
If not serving immediately, press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the guacamole to prevent browning and refrigerate, preferably not for more than a few hours.
