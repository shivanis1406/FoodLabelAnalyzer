Title: Tips to lower trans fat intake

1. Read labels carefully and avoid foods with trans fats.
2. Avoid eating commercially prepared baked foods  (including cookies, pies, and donuts), snack foods, and processed foods, including fast foods, unless you know they are trans free.
3. When cooking, choose healthier oils such olive, canola, or another liquid vegetable oil. If you desire a buttery flavor, try blending olive oil and butter, using only a small amount of butter.
4. When dining out, avoid deep-fried foods because some restaurants still use partially hydrogenated oils in their fryers.
