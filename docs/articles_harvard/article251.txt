Title: Healthy Workplaces

Approximately 130 million full-time American workers spend over one-third of their day, five days per week engaged with their place of employment. [1,2] Due to the number of people reached and the amount time spent in these settings, creating healthy worksite programs, policies, and environments have the potential to positively impact workers’ health. [3,4]
Diet-related chronic diseases are among the health conditions that contribute to direct medical costs and lost productivity to U.S. employers, including  heart disease , hypertension, and  diabetes . [3] Worksite wellness programs primarily focus on improving health, increasing productivity, and reducing insurance costs. [4]
What about remote and hybrid workers?
Worksite Wellness Programs
Worksite wellness programs have used a variety of mechanisms to promote health. Programs can be offered to the entire workplace, or specifically targeted to high-risk individuals.
Best practices for worksite wellness
Employers offer multifaceted nutrition and physical activity programs and initiatives. [2,4,6] Programs would include components such as:
 
 Employee steering committees 



 Nutrition classes and seminars 



 Promotional and educational materials 



 Health risk assessments 



 Goal setting and lifestyle skills 



 Group  exercise sessions 



 Signage to promote stair use 



 Increased availability of healthy foods and nutrition labeling in worksite cafeterias

Development of healthy food and beverage procurement policies for cafeterias, vending machines, concessions stands, and/or for food provided at meetings, conferences and other organizational events. [2,8-10,16]
Create initiate incentive-based walking programs for employees. [8,9]
Initiate employee wellness programs that includes promoting use of stairs and  walking trails , and targeting healthy eating. [8,9]
The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Workplace Health Resource Center (WHRC)  provides tools and products that employers can use to create tailored health promotion programs to meet their specific workplace needs.
