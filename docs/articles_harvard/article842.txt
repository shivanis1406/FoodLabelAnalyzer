Title: Asparagus Spears with Mandarin Orange

Asparagus Spears with Mandarin Orange
1 pound fresh asparagus
1 4-ounce can of mandarin oranges, drained
1 tablespoon olive oil
Salt (optional) and pepper to taste
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
Break off and discard the woody ends of the asparagus and cut the stalks into 2-inch pieces.
Put the asparagus in a bowl, drizzle it with the olive oil, and sprinkle it with pepper and, if desired, salt. Toss gently to distribute the olive oil.
Spread the asparagus evenly on a baking sheet and roast in the oven until tender, about 25 minutes.
Remove from the oven, place in a warmed bowl, toss with the mandarin orange sections, and serve.
