Title: Healthy Kitchens, Healthy Lives Recipe Nutrition Goals

Healthy Kitchens, Healthy Lives  (HKHL) is annual conference that bridges nutrition science, health care, and the culinary arts. A collaboration between the Harvard Chan School’s Department of Nutrition and The Culinary Institute of America, the conference was created to  teach medical professionals about nutrition and self-care , so that they will be better prepared to teach patients valuable skills for leading healthier lives.
Achieving at least 6 out of 7 criteria below is a shared and aspirational goal for every HKHL recipe, some of which are featured in our  recipe bank  (where indicated).

Plant-Based Protein Goal: 
 >50% plant-based protein (beans, legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains) for the day***
*These calorie limits are based on a 2,000 kcal diet. The items above do not include beverages or snacks that may contribute calories to the daily diet. Daily caloric needs are based on age, gender, and physical activity level. Some individuals may require more or fewer calories than this per meal and per day.
**Does not include natural sugars from dairy, fruits, or vegetables. The American Heart Association recommendation for  added sugar  is a maximum of 24g for women (6 teaspoons) and 36 grams for men (9 teaspoons).
*** The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for  protein  is 0.8g/kg (0.36g/lb) body weight per day. This equates to 54g protein per day for an individual who weights 150lbs. For reference, the protein content of 1/2 cup of cooked beans is 8g; 1 ounce of nuts is 7g; and 1 cup of chopped broccoli is 2.5g. Most Americans consume protein beyond the needed recommendations.
