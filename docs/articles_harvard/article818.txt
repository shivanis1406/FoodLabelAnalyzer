Title: Roasted Sweet Potatoes with Pecans

Roasted Sweet Potatoes with Pecans
4 sweet potatoes, scrubbed and cut into bite-size pieces
2 tablespoons olive oil
Â¼ cup toasted pecans, coarsely chopped
Salt (optional) and pepper to taste
Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
Toss the sweet potato pieces with the olive oil, salt (optional) and pepper, and place in a baking dish.
Roast for 10 minutes, stir, then remove from oven and toss the sweet potatoes with a spatula or tongs so that they will brown evenly. Return the sweet potatoes to the oven and roast until they are fork tender, about another 10 minutes.
Remove sweet potatoes from the oven and toss with the pecans. Return to the oven and roast another 7 to 10 minutes.
Remove the sweet potato mixture to a warm platter and serve immediately.
