2 cups cooked beans or drained and rinsed canned beans, such as black beans, chickpeas, pinto beans, or a combination
8 or 9 sprigs cilantro, chopped

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
Make the enchilada sauce :
 
 Heat the olive oil in a medium pot over medium heat. 
 Stir together the chili powder, oregano, cumin, garlic powder, and onion powder in a bowl. 
 Add the spices to the hot oil all at once. Cook, stirring, for a few seconds to allow the spices to become fragrant and infuse the oil with flavor without burning. 
 Add the tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. 
 Puree directly in the pot with an immersion blender. (If the sauce is not deep enough to fully immerse the blender and prevent splattering, carefully transfer the sauce to a deep bowl or jar to blend. Return to the pan after blending.) 
 Simmer for 5 minutes more to slightly reduce the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Set aside. (This sauce can be made ahead and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks and reheated for quicker prep.)

Assemble the casserole : In a 9‑inch square casserole dish, combine the quinoa, enchilada sauce, chile, beans, cilantro, cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper, and 3/4 cup of the cheese. Adjust the seasonings. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup cheese evenly over the top.
Bake until bubbling and the cheese has melted, about 15 minutes.
Serve immediately, garnished with the avocado and fresh tomato.
