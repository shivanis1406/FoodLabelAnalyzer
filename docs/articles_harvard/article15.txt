Title: B Vitamins

You’re probably familiar with Vitamin B6 and B12, but did you know there are actually eight B vitamins?
B1 (thiamin)
B2 (riboflavin)
B3 (niacin)
B5 (pantothenic acid)
B6 (pyridoxine)
B7 (biotin)
B9 (folate [folic acid])
B12 (cobalamin)
These vitamins help a variety of enzymes do their jobs, ranging from releasing energy from carbohydrates and fat to breaking down amino acids and transporting oxygen and energy-containing nutrients around the body.
