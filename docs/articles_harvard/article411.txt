Title: Mushrooms

An often under-appreciated food, mushrooms have been eaten and used as medicine for thousands of years. Traditional and folk medicine practitioners laud the bell-shaped fungi for their healing and cleansing properties. All varieties of mushrooms are low in calories and fat, and contain modest amounts of fiber and various nutrients. Perhaps the more interesting properties of mushrooms are their non-nutritive plant substances—polysaccharides, indoles, polyphenols, and carotenoids in which cell and animal studies have shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. [1] Mushrooms are also recognized by chefs for their ability to create savory rich flavors called umami, thanks to the presence of an amino acid called glutamate, which is also found in meats, fish, cheeses, and simmering soups.
Although considered a vegetable, mushrooms are neither a plant nor animal food. They are a type of fungus that contains a substance called ergosterol, similar in structure to cholesterol in animals. Ergosterol can be transformed into vitamin D with exposure to ultraviolet light. Mushrooms vary in appearance with more than 10,000 known types, but generally they are distinguished by a stem, fleshy rounded cap, and gills underneath the cap. China and the U.S. are among the top five producers of mushrooms worldwide.

Are mushrooms a good source of vitamin D?
The amount of vitamin D mushrooms contain varies widely and depends on how long the mushrooms are exposed to UV light. Estimates show that fresh wild mushrooms like chanterelles and morels can contain up to 1200 IU of vitamin D per 3.5-ounce serving, whereas mushrooms grown in darkened conditions like white button, shiitake, and oyster contain less than 40 IU. [3] However, button mushrooms that are exposed to sunlight can produce up to 400 IU vitamin D per 3.5-ounce serving though the exact amount depends on factors related to their UV exposure such as the time of day, season, latitude, and duration. Mushrooms treated with UV lamps can produce even higher amounts of vitamin D. Even after harvesting, mushrooms can continue to produce vitamin D, whether exposed to UV light from the sun or a lamp.
Dried mushrooms also contain the vitamin. Some estimates show dried mushrooms to contain about 600 IU of vitamin D2 per 3.5 ounces if stored in dark, cool, dry conditions for up to 6 months (the vitamin may start to break down after that time). [3]
Humidity and cooking mushrooms in water do not appear to affect vitamin D content in mushrooms, but cooking them in fat (such as oils) can cause the vitamin to leach out because it is fat-soluble.

Mushrooms and Health
Edible mushrooms like maitake and shiitake have also been used as medicine throughout history. Other mushrooms that are too tough to eat have been used solely for medicinal purposes such as reishi. Plant chemicals and components in mushrooms may exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects, but the exact mechanism is still unclear and an area of active research. [4] Animal and cell studies show that mushrooms can stimulate the activity of immune cells, macrophages, and free radicals that can stop the growth and spread of tumor cells and cause existing tumor cells to die. [5] Various polysaccharides in mushrooms including beta-glucans are believed to exert these cancer-fighting properties. [4,6]
Two epidemiological studies found that higher mushroom intake had protective effects on the brain in older adults. [7, 8] Components in mushrooms may prevent the growth of amyloid proteins related to dementia, and act as antioxidants, specifically an amino acid called ergothioneine. A 2019 cross-sectional study of 663 Chinese men and women 60 years of age and older found that those who ate more than 2 servings of mushrooms per week (1 serving = 3/4 cup cooked) compared with those who ate less than 1 serving per week had a reduced risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). [9] After adjusting for potential confounders (factors linked with cognitive decline) such as body mass index, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and dietary intake of meat, vegetables, fruits, and nuts, the group with the higher intake of mushrooms had a 52% lower risk of developing MCI than the low intake group. This cross-sectional study only provided a snapshot of the prevalence of MCI in the participants at one point in time; the authors noted that a direct effect of mushrooms on cognition could not be made by this study. For example, it is possible that people who developed MCI had changed their diet that included less mushrooms. Epidemiological studies following people over time, measuring biomarkers for ergothioneine and other mushrooms substances, and randomized clinical trials that administer ergothioneine or other mushroom phytonutrients will help to shed light on its potential effect on cognition.
Mushrooms contain polysaccharides that act as a  prebiotic , or food for beneficial gut bacteria. Studies show that these polysaccharides stimulate the growth and survival of beneficial strains like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. They remain undigested and therefore can reach the colon where these bacteria live. [10, 11]
In two large prospective cohort studies, mushroom consumption was not significantly associated with risk of  type 2 diabetes ,  cardiovascular disease , [12] or cancer. [13]  However, low levels of mushroom consumption in the populations may have limited the ability of these studies to detect significant associations. In addition, mushroom consumption was measured once at baseline and consumption patterns may have changed over time. Moreover, different types of mushrooms were not assessed in the Food Frequency Questionnaires.

Purchase
There are thousands of varieties of mushrooms, with different colors, shapes, and sizes. Because some wild mushrooms can cause stomach upset or allergic reactions, or may even be poisonous, your safest bet is to stick to supermarket varieties and avoid picking and eating raw wild mushrooms on your own.
The common button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) is the most common in the U.S. It is the mildest-tasting mushroom and can be eaten raw or cooked.
Other types of mushrooms available for sale include:
Chanterelle:  the cap is a wavy golden trumpet-like shape Cremini (baby bella) :  a young Portobello mushroom that is dark and firm Enoki:  long, thin white stems with small white caps that are eaten raw or cooked Maitake:  a head that resembles flowering leaves Morel:  the cap is a spongy dimpled oblong shape Oyster:  a fan-shaped delicate cap Porcini:  a reddish-brown rounded cap with a thick cylindrical stem Portobello :  a large brown thick cap with rich juicy flavor that work well as a meat substitute Shiitake:  a dark brown umbrella cap with a thin cream-colored stem
Mushrooms that have been specially treated with UV light may carry a label on the front of the package that says “UV-treated” or “rich in vitamin D,” or display the exact amount of vitamin D they contain.

Storage
Select mushrooms with firm whole caps with an even texture. They should be refrigerated until use, but ideally within one week. Do not wash or clean them until just before using. Storing in a brown paper bag with the top open will help to absorb moisture and keep them from spoiling, as opposed to tight plastic wrapping that traps moisture. Because they are about 80-90% water, mushrooms do not freeze well, becoming mushy when defrosted.

Make
Mushrooms are delicate and should be cleaned gently. Either place them under gentle running water to release any dirt or brush dirt off with a dampened paper towel.
Cooking mushrooms in high-temperature water such as boiling and microwaving may cause its water-soluble nutrients (B vitamins, potassium) to escape in the cooking water. Sautéing quickly over high heat, or simmering over low heat, such as in soups, are ideal cooking methods for preserving nutrients.
Add chopped mushrooms into salads, omelets, scrambled eggs, stir-fries, pasta sauces, chilis, or soups.
Sauté mushrooms in olive oil and add to cooked pasta or whole grains.
Grill large portobello mushroom caps. Remove the stems and gills if desired. Marinate the mushrooms for 10 minutes in a favorite sauce. Grill for about 3 minutes each side until they caramelize.
Mushrooms make a great replacement for meat  because of their umami flavor. Replace about a quarter to a half of the meat in a recipe with chopped mushrooms.

Did You Know?
Not all mushrooms are edible. Wild mushrooms with white gills or a ring around the stem are considered poisonous. Some other inedible mushrooms look like edible mushrooms, so unless one is trained in recognizing wild mushrooms, it’s best to find your mushrooms at the market!
