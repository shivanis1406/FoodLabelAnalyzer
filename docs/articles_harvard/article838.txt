Title: Wheatberries and Chives

Wheat Berries and Chives
¾ cup wheat berries
¼ cup brown rice
1 cup raisins
1 medium onion, diced
2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
1 tablespoon olive oil
¼ cup fresh chives, chopped
Reconstitute the raisins by microwaving them in 1 cup of water for 2 minutes; drain.
In a medium saucepan, bring the broth to a boil over high heat.
Add the wheat berries to the pan, reduce the heat to low, and cover. Simmer the wheat berries for about 30 minutes, then add brown rice, and cover. Continue simmering the grains until all the liquid has been absorbed and the grains are tender, an additional 30 to 40 minutes. If the grains dry out before they are tender, add a small amount of water, as needed.
Meanwhile, warm the olive oil in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until it is tender. Set aside.
When the grains are tender, remove from heat. Add the onions, raisins, and chives, toss gently, and serve.
