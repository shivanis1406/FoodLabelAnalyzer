Title: Strategies for Eating Well on a Budget

An all-too-common mantra says, “It’s too expensive to eat healthy.” It’s true that when comparing specific foods like organic fruits with conventional fruits, the former tends to be a few dollars more per pound. And when a shopping cart filled with fresh produce, poultry, and fish is compared with one loaded with boxes of macaroni and cheese, ground hamburger meat, and cookies, the latter will likely ring lower at the cash register.
Certainly,  policy improvements and other actions  are needed to create a food environment where the healthy choice is the easy and accessible choice. In the meantime, know that creating nutritious meals can be more affordable than one might think. In fact, one meta-analysis looking at the price difference between healthful and less healthful dietary patterns found that diets with healthier foods only cost a bit more—about $1.48 per day. [1]
A note on food affordability and resources that can help
From the supermarket to the kitchen, here are some strategies to get the biggest nutrition bang for your buck.
Tips for Supermarket Savings
Supermarket savings isn’t just about finding the cheapest sale items. It also means preventing impulse purchases that are caused by enticing food advertising or shopping on an empty stomach (that makes everything look delicious!).  Food waste  is another money drain when food spoils before it is prepared or eaten and is thrown out. Consider the following tips before heading to the market:
Plan out a few meals  you want to prepare the next week and create your shopping list based on these ingredients.
Consider meatless meals .  Plant-based proteins  are highly nutritious and generally more affordable than meats and fish. If you still crave meat,  incorporate smaller amounts  as a base for flavor or as a condiment, while focusing on plant proteins like  beans  or  tofu  so that you can save on cost, increase volume of the meal, and boost nutrition and heartiness.
Purchase foods and snacks that are satiating and filling . How easy is it to eat a half a package of chips in one sitting? In contrast, how many handfuls of  nuts  or  apples  can you eat at one time? Even though a 3-pound bag of apples may cost $4.00 versus $2.50 for a large bag of chips, consider which will satisfy your hunger longer. One study found that unsatiating foods leave people wanting to eat more often, which may translate into greater food costs. [2]
Don’t shop on an empty stomach . Munch on a piece of fruit or some nuts before entering the store.
Allow for flexibility in your shopping list  if items like fresh produce or poultry and fish are on sale. If they are foods you enjoy, you might purchase extra quantities and freeze them for later use. Fresh meats, fish, and some produce ( bananas , berries,  avocados , broccoli, cauliflower,  Brussels sprouts , corn) freeze well.
Consider purchasing nonperishable staple foods in bulk . Even though it may cost more upfront to buy a “family-sized” package products like  whole grains ,  lentils , and  dried beans , the cost per unit is usually cheaper. To determine this, you will need to calculate the price per unit:
 
 Find the common unit of measurement when comparing two products. For example, a bag of brown rice may be in pounds. 
 Divide the price of the rice by the total pounds, which is the price per unit. Example: Rice A costs $1.59 for a 1-pound bag ($1.59 per pound), whereas Rice B costs $3.99 for a 5-pound bag (about $0.80 per pound). Rice B is cheaper.

Buy generic or store-brand : you will notice when comparing the ingredients list that similar if not identical ingredients are used. The generic brand is generally cheaper because less money is spent on advertising and creating fancy food labels.
Scan the discounted produce cart  that usually sits in a corner; this is filled with produce starting to age but which are still tasty if you can eat them the same day or the next day.
Don’t buy more highly perishable items than you can use in one week  (unless you plan to freeze them), or else you run the risk of food spoilage and waste. Learn  how to store produce  correctly for a longer shelf life, and be aware of highly perishable foods such as ready-to-eat bagged salad greens, mushrooms, berries, avocados, and bananas.
Stretch your fresh herbs, spices, and alliums . These are key ingredients for building flavorful meals, and while alliums like onions and garlic have a longer shelf life, bagged herbs in the supermarket are particularly perishable. Unless a recipe calls for a whole package (e.g. a bunch of basil for pesto), you’ll be left with extra sprigs. Careful storage can help extend the shelf life (e.g. cilantro in a cup of water covered with a bag), but if you don’t plan on using within one week, consider other ways to extend their utility. One idea is to chop and freeze herbs in an ice cube tray filled with olive oil—ready to be popped in a pan to sauté vegetables.
 
 Another flavor-builder that can handle the freezer is ginger: store in an airtight bag and when ready to use, peel and grate as much as you like (no need to thaw), returning the remainder to the freezer. 
 If you enjoy fresh scallions (green onions), you can easily regrow them on a sunny windowsill. Place the white root ends in a glass of water (changing out the water about once per week). Once the green ends have regrown, snip what you need and let the rest keep growing.

Use what you have before buying more . Commit to taking inventory of all the food in your kitchen twice a month. Bring forward the buried items and plan meals based on these ingredients.
Eat attentively . Practicing mindfulness during meals (known as  mindful eating ) can increase enjoyment of the food. You may even be satisfied with smaller portions. Conversely, eating while distracted can lead to feeling hungry again sooner and a higher intake of food later on. [3,4]
Nutritious and Inexpensive Staples
A combination of fresh and processed foods can make up a healthful shopping list. Processed foods have their pros and cons but they shouldn’t be entirely labeled as unhealthy, since the  degree of processing and type of processing  affects nutrient content. For example, thanks to processing methods like freezing and canning, we can fill our freezers and stock our pantries with healthy staples like frozen fruits and vegetables, tinned fish, and canned beans. That said, when choosing canned or frozen foods, select options that do not include extra sodium, sugar, or other additives.
Here are some foods that are economical year-round and offer a wide range of nutrients including protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals:
Beans , peas,  lentils  (dried, frozen, canned)
Canned fish (tuna, salmon, sardines)
Ground turkey 90% lean
Chicken thighs with skin (these are cheaper than skinless chicken thighs but the skin can be removed before cooking)
Peanut butter
Lowfat cottage cheese
Tofu
Eggs
Leafy greens ( kale , collards)
Whole heads lettuce or cabbage
Broccoli
Radishes
Fresh carrots
Fresh  apples
Fresh  bananas
Any fresh produce on sale
Frozen unsweetened fruit
Frozen or canned vegetables without added salt
Generic store-brand high-fiber cereals (plain shredded wheat, bran)
Whole rolled  oats
Whole grains, dried ( brown rice , millet, barley, bulgur)
Whole grain pasta
Peanuts
Dried popcorn kernels to cook in an air-popper
String cheese
Sodium-free herbs (cumin, curry, thyme, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder) and herb blends
Canned reduced-sodium tomato paste
Vinegars
Olive oil and other liquid vegetable oils
