Title: Diet Reviews

From bookstores to social media to blogs, there’s no shortage of information on diet. So how to differentiate what “works” from an overhyped fad?
It’s important to remember that even if a particular diet may be successful for one person, it may not be effective for another due to individual differences in genes and lifestyle. And while research shows that calories matter,  focusing on food quality  is an equally important part of  preventing weight gain  and promoting weight loss. Diets are also more likely to be successful when they are easier to follow, so tailoring a strategy to suit your own lifestyle is key.
Still, when faced with the seemingly endless promotion of weight-loss strategies and diet plans, it helps to see what evidence is supporting them.  In this series, we take a look at some popular diets and approaches to eating—and review the research behind them.
