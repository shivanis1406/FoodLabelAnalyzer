Title: Fruit Cooler

Store-bought or café smoothies are marketed as “health” foods, but they are often loaded with sugar and high in calories—some have upwards of 300 calories in a 12-ounce serving. Try making a refreshing fresh fruit cooler instead. There’s no added sugar, and just a small amount of fruit, so this drink is only about 18 calories for each 12-ounce glass.
Fruit Cooler
1/2 cup ice
3/4 cup sugar-free sparkling water
1/3 cup of melon or berries
Chopped mint leaves or citrus slices (optional)
Place ice, sparkling water, and fruit in a blender.
Blend until slushy, pour into a glass and garnish with mint or citrus slices.
