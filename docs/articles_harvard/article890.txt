Title: Crawfish Etouffee

The longer this stew sits, the better it gets. As the scallions keep poorly in the stew, be sure to add them just before serving.
Crawfish Etouffee
1 stalk celery, finely chopped
1 large onion, finely chopped
1 medium-large sweet green pepper, finely chopped
½ cup finely chopped parsley (including stems)
1/3 cup sesame oil
2 to 3 tablespoons whole wheat pastry flour
2 tablespoons tomato puree
1 cup water
1 large clove garlic, crushed
Cayenne pepper
Low-sodium soy sauce (optional)
Worcestershire sauce (optional)
1 pound crawfish tails, shelled, or 1½ pounds medium-size or small shrimp, shelled
¼ cup chopped scallions
Hot pepper sauce (optional)
Sauté the celery, onions, sweet green peppers, parsley in the sesame oil for about 20 minutes over medium heat.
Add the flour and stir until lightly browned. Add the tomato puree and water and stir for 4 minutes over a low flame.
Stir in the garlic, a pinch of cayenne, and a dash each of soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce if you wish. Add the crawfish tails or shrimp and simmer for 20 minutes. Just before serving, stir in the scallions, and a dash of hot pepper sauce if you wish.
Serve hot over brown rice.
