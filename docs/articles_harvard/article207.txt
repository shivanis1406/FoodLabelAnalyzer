Title: The Healthy Eating Plate now available in other languages!

The Healthy Eating Plate  — a simple, visual meal-planning guide that addresses important deficiencies in the U.S. government’s MyPlate icon—is now available in  15 languages , giving it the potential to reach over half the world’s population.
