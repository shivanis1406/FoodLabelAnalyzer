Title: Baked Ricotta with Rosemary and Pepper Flakes

This is a wonderful addition to any brunch. The flavorful baked ricotta can be used as a spread for toasted whole grain bread. The rosemary adds a wonderful citrus note and the pepper flakes add a little heat. This is also great cooked with scrambled eggs.
Baked Ricotta with Rosemary and Pepper Flakes
2 cups part-skim ricotta cheese
1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary
¼ – ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
½ teaspoon kosher or sea salt
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.
In a small mixing bowl combine the ricotta with rosemary, pepper flakes, and salt.
Oil an ovenproof shallow baking dish with the extra virgin olive oil and transfer the cheese mixture to the baking dish. Smooth the cheese into an even layer of about ¾-inch thickness.
Place the cheese into the oven and bake for about 25 minutes, or until the cheese puffs up in the middle as well as along the edges. Remove the cheese from the oven and allow to cool slightly before serving.
