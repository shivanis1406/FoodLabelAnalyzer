Title: Kale with Caramelized Onions

Kale with Caramelized Onions
1 pound fresh kale, roughly chopped
1 medium-sized onion, sliced thin
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional)
Salt and pepper to taste
First, caramelize the onions: Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a sauté pan over medium low heat and add the onions.
Cook very slowly on medium low heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are browned; do not burn. When finished, remove from heat and set aside.
In a separate sauté pan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Add the chopped kale and sauté until tender, about 8 minutes.
Add the onions and, if desired, the lemon juice. Toss together. Remove from heat and serve.
