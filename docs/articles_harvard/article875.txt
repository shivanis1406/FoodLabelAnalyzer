Title: Fresh Spinach with Sesame Seeds

Fresh Spinach with Sesame Seeds
1 pound baby spinach
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon canola oil or peanut oil
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
Heat the canola or peanut oil in a wok or a large sauté pan over medium heat, and sauté the garlic for 20 seconds; do not let it get brown.
Add spinach and toss lightly with tongs so that all pieces cook evenly.
When spinach is lightly wilted, remove from heat, drizzle with sesame oil, and toss. Add sesame seeds and toss again. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.
