Title: Moroccan Chicken Stew with Apricots

Rich warm spices and sweet dried fruit make this Moroccan stew an instant favorite. Although traditional spice mixes rely on ground ginger and turmeric, the fresh roots add a bright flavor that can’t be matched. The combination of sweet and savory in this sauce makes it a great companion to almost any protein. (See more recipes from  Always Delicious ).
Moroccan Chicken Stew with Apricots
For the Moroccan Sauce:

 Dash of freshly grated nutmeg 
 1/4 teaspoon ground white or black pepper 
 9 or 10 sprigs cilantro, stems and leaves coarsely chopped 
 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
 1/4 cup water 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 Dash of cayenne pepper, or to taste (optional)
1 (2‑inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced into thin rounds
3 medium cloves garlic
1 (3‑ to 4‑inch) piece fresh turmeric, peeled, or 1 teaspoon ground turmeric (optional)
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
Dash of freshly grated nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground white or black pepper
9 or 10 sprigs cilantro, stems and leaves coarsely chopped
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup water
1/2 teaspoon salt
Dash of cayenne pepper, or to taste (optional)
For the Chicken Stew:
 
 Moroccan Sauce (Ingredients above)) 
 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1‑inch cubes or slices 
 1 to 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
 1 medium onion, diced 
 2 medium carrots, cut into chunks (about 1 cup) 
 1 small sweet potato or 1/2 small winter squash, cut into 1‑inch pieces (about 1 1/2 cups) 
 6 dried apricots, whole or diced, or 4 fresh apricots, quartered and pitted 
 1/4 cup water 
 1/4 teaspoon salt
Moroccan Sauce (Ingredients above))
1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1‑inch cubes or slices
1 to 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium onion, diced
2 medium carrots, cut into chunks (about 1 cup)
1 small sweet potato or 1/2 small winter squash, cut into 1‑inch pieces (about 1 1/2 cups)
6 dried apricots, whole or diced, or 4 fresh apricots, quartered and pitted
1/4 cup water
1/4 teaspoon salt
Make the sauce:  Place all the ingredients in a wide-mouthed mason jar or cup that will fit an immersion blender without splashing. Blend, working the blender in the jar until the garlic, ginger, and turmeric are smooth. Place a lid on the jar. For best results, set aside for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to develop. The sauce will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
Marinate the chicken : Place the sauce in a large zip-top bag, add the chicken, seal the bag, and massage to completely coat the chicken with the sauce. Place it in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 1 hour and up to overnight (or cook it immediately if you have less time).
Prepare the stew:  Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven or stovetop-safe slow cooker insert over medium heat, or in a slow cooker on the sauté setting. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir in the chicken and sauce from the bag, carrots, sweet potatoes, apricots, water, and salt. Cook, stirring, for 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, or transfer the ingredients or the slow-cooker insert to the slow cooker. Cover and simmer for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 1/2 hours on the stovetop (longer, slow cooking creates a more savory dish) or cook on low in a slow cooker for up to 8 hours or according to the manufacturer’s instructions. If desired, remove the lid for the last 15 to 30 minutes to thicken the sauce.
Serve hot (stew pictured over Cauliflower Couscous).
