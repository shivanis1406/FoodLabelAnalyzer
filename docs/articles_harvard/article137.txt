Title: HSPH Researchers Support Trans Fat Ban in NYC Restaurants

Calling artificial trans fats “the most harmful nutrient in our diet,” two researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health testified in support of a proposed ban on trans fats in New York City restaurants.
The measure, proposed by the  New York City Dept. of Health and Mental Hygiene , would give restaurants six months to switch to using oils, margarines and shortening that have less than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving. Within 18 months, all foods that restaurants serve would need to have less than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving; the only exception would be for packaged foods that are served in the manufacturer’s original packaging.
At an October 30, 2006 hearing on the trans fat restrictions, Dr. Walter Willett, chair of the Dept. of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health, and Dr. Dariush Mozzafarian, an instructor in the Dept. of Epidemiology at Harvard School of Public Health, detailed the many negative health effects associated with trans fat intake, including increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease.
