Blueberry Muffins
Blueberry Muffins
1 cup (120 g) whole wheat pastry flour
¾ cup (90 g) white whole wheat flour
¼ cup (26 g) almond flour
1 tsp. (4 g) baking powder
½ tsp. (4 g) baking soda
½ tsp.    (2 g) salt
1 tsp. (2 g) orange zest

1 Tbsp.   (14 g) orange juice, freshly squeezed
½ tsp. (4 g) vanilla
Place the rack in the top third of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit Line muffin tins with paper liners.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and orange zest. Add the fresh blue berries and toss gently to coat the blueberries in flour. This will help keep the blueberries suspended in the batter versus falling to the bottom.
In a medium mixing bowl, lightly beat the eggs, then whisk in the buttermilk, brown sugar, canola oil, orange juice, and vanilla. Don’t be concerned if the mixture looks curdled or lumpy.
Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until most of the flour is incorporated. The mixture can be slightly lumpy; don’t over mix. Divide the batter among the 18 prepared muffin cups.
Bake 12 to 14 minutes, until the muffins are golden brown around the edges.
