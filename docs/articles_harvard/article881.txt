Title: Recipes

Healthy eating is as delicious as it is nutritious—a feast for the senses as well as good for the body.  The Healthy Eating Plate  is an excellent guide for creating healthy, balanced meals, and cooking is a great way to experiment with new flavors. We offer recipes for  cooking at home  — whether for yourself, or your friends and family — as well as recipes for larger  food service  operations.
To get you started, we’ve compiled helpful suggestions for how to create a healthy kitchen.
5 Quick Tips to Stock a Healthy Kitchen
1. Produce 
 Choose locally grown  vegetables and fruits  whenever you can, and eat plenty every day. Aim for a variety of colors — variety is as important as quantity; no single fruit or vegetable provides all of the nutrients you need to be healthy.
2. Grains 
 Trade in white rice for  whole grains  such as barley, bulgur, oat berries,  quinoa , brown rice, and more. Try perusing your local grocery store’s bulk bins to discover new, delicious whole grains that are often simple to prepare.
3. Protein 
 Rely on healthy  protein  such as fresh fish, chicken or turkey, tofu,  eggs , and a variety of beans and  nuts . Remember to balance your plate with lots of vegetables & fruit, whole grains and healthy fats as well.
4. Fats and oils 
 Use liquid vegetable  oils  whenever possible for sautéing vegetables, stir-frying fish or chicken, and as the base of salad dressings.  Good choices  include canola, sunflower, corn, soybean, peanut, and olive oil.
5. Other essentials 
 Even a small amount of a high-quality ingredient can have a big impact on flavor. Stock your kitchen with high-quality basics like extra virgin olive oil,  balsamic vinegar , fresh and dried herbs, and a variety of unsalted nuts (such as walnuts, almonds, and pistachios), and you’ll have flavorful building blocks for any recipe.

A note about recipe development 
Some of the  recipes  were contributed by well-known chefs like Ming Tsai and Mollie Katzen, who collaborated with Harvard University Dining Services chefs Martin Breslin and Patty Gregory. Other recipes are from the renowned Culinary Institute of America. These contributors created colorful dishes that are both healthy and delicious.
