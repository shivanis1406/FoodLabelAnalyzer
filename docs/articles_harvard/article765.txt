Title: Mashed Cauliflower

This creamy side dish offers a healthy and delicious alternative to mashed potatoes.
Mashed Cauliflower
1 head cauliflower, cut into flowers
2 to 3 tablespoons skim milk
1 tablespoon olive oil
Â¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Steam cauliflower in a medium-sized pot on the stove top until tender (approximately 10 minutes). Remove cauliflower from heat and let it cool slightly.
Once cool, pulse cauliflower in a food processor or blender until smooth, adding skim milk as needed if the mixture gets too dry.
Brush an 8-inch by 8-inch casserole dish with olive oil. Spoon cauliflower into the baking dish and smooth with a spatula.
Sprinkle the top with parmesan cheese and bake until brown on top, about 25 minutes. Let the casserole cool for 10 minutes before serving.
