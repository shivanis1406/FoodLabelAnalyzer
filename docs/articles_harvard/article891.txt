Title: Fish Creole

Serve this fish stew over brown rice.
Fish Creole
¼ cup olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
½ sweet green pepper, finely chopped
1 stalk celery, finely chopped
¼ cup chopped parsley
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 16-ounce can tomato puree
½ to 1 cup water or fish stock
2 bay leaves
1 pound non-oily white-fleshed fish scraps (monkfish is nice), cut into large bite-size chunks
Hot pepper sauce
Cayenne pepper
Heat the oil in a large pot and sauté the onions, sweet green peppers, celery, parsley, and garlic until wilted and cooked through, about 10 minutes.
Add the tomato purée, ½ cup water or stock, and the bay leaves. Simmer for 20 minutes, add the fish and remaining water or stock, if necessary, and cook for 15 minutes longer, or until the fish flakes when tested with a fork.
Add hot pepper sauce and cayenne to taste.
