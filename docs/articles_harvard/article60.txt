Title: Healthy Living Guide 2022/2023


A Digest on Healthy Eating and Healthy Living
Throughout 2022, food and nutrition were often in the spotlight, perhaps most notably with the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. The  national strategy  that emerged from the event (the first of its kind since the original conference in 1969) aims at ending hunger and increasing healthy eating and physical activity by 2030. While the plan includes many promising approaches, such as expanding nutrition assistance programs and covering medically tailored meals under Medicare, our Department of Nutrition experts also  noted some major omissions , including protecting children from unhealthy food marketing, as well as transforming the food system in response to climate change. “To have a significant impact, the administration must bring together the public and private sectors, along with philanthropists, academia, and individuals to develop truly sustainable food systems that support both public and planetary health,” Drs. Frank Hu, Walter Willett, and Lilian Cheung wrote in reflection of the event.
Indeed, there is much work to be done in creating policies that ensure there is not only enough food to sustain current and future generations, but also make optimal choices accessible and affordable to all. In the meantime, we encourage you to incorporate healthy behaviors wherever you can—no change is too small! We hope you find this Guide useful, and we wish you a fulfilling 2023.
