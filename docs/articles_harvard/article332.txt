Title: Protein, carbs, and weight loss

How might a high-protein, low-carb diet lead to weight loss more quickly than a low-fat, high-carb diet, at least in the short run?
First , chicken, beef, fish, beans, and other high-protein foods move more slowly from the stomach to the intestine. Slower stomach emptying means you feel full for longer and get hungrier later.

Second , protein’s gentle, steady effect on blood sugar prevents the sharp blood sugar dips (and accompanying hunger) that often occur after eating rapidly digested carbohydrate, like white bread or baked potato.
Third , the body uses more calories to digest protein than it does to digest fat or carbohydrate. ( 1 )
Eating higher amounts of protein also seems to help dieters preserve lean muscle during weight loss, and this, too, can help boost the amount of energy they burn. ( 2 )
If you do decide to follow a higher-protein, lower-carbohydrate eating plan, choose the healthiest sources of protein possible. Remember that limiting red meat and avoiding processed meat—and choosing healthier high-protein foods in their place, such as fish, chicken, beans, or nuts—will help the heart  and  the waistline.
