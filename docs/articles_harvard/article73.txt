Title: Roadmap to a healthy and sustainable food future

Despite substantial scientific evidence linking diets with human health and  environmental sustainability , historically there’s been a lack of globally-agreed upon targets for healthy diets and sustainable food production.
However, on January 17, 2019, the EAT- Lancet  Commission (a group of 37 scientists from 16 countries working in the fields of human health, nutrition, economics, agriculture, political sciences, and environmental sustainability) assessed existing evidence and  developed the world’s first  scientific targets  that define a “safe operating space” for food systems.
The report calls for global cooperation and commitment to shift diets toward  healthy, largely plant-based patterns ; make large reductions in  food loss and waste ; and implement significant sustainability improvements in food production practices.
