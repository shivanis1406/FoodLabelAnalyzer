Title: Activating a Move-Friendly World

Sometimes the most innovative ideas do not rely on the latest technology but perhaps something far more challenging: changing the norm.
Imagine this scenario. You are attending a fascinating lecture, diligently taking notes, when abruptly the speaker pushes away the microphone and steps from the podium. She requests everyone to rise from their seats and begin to march or hop in place while waving your arms overhead. Your first thought, like most, would likely be bewilderment. You might hesitate and look around at others seated near you. You might chuckle nervously before finally rising out of your chair. Why? Because this is not necessarily perceived as “normal” behavior.
Ready to change this norm,  Dr. Kaumudi Joshipura  is leading a movement entitled  VMove  (short for “We Move”), with the slogan: “Activating a Move-Friendly World.” Joshipura demonstrated the above scenario at a  TEDx talk , and because she had already explained the concept, the audience was prepared and most rose out of their seats quickly. They moved shyly at first, but as the entire audience participated, it was clear everyone was having fun moving, even within the very limited space!
Moving “Creactively”
We know that a  sedentary lifestyle  has contributed to epidemic obesity rates as well as other chronic diseases. [1,2] It has been suggested that hours of sitting may be more harmful than smoking because more people sit excessively than smoke. [3] Only about  20 percent of Americans  meet CDC recommendations for exercise, which includes engaging in moderate aerobic activity for at least 30 minutes on five days per week, and muscle strengthening at least two days per week. Joshipura affirms following national or international physical activity guidelines, as well as newer guidelines that specifically recommend reducing and breaking sedentary time. [4,5] Research shows that frequent bouts of light activity such as stepping, calf raises, or doing moderate housework offer health benefits of lowering blood sugar and cholesterol. [6,7,8] These spurts of activity can give people a head start on meeting their exercise goals even though they are not performed in a traditional gym setting.
“ VMove  aims to change the norms and increase the visibility of physical activity in different settings, to inspire and enable more people to engage in physical activity more frequently,” Joshipura explains. “You do not have to don a t-shirt, sweatpants, and sneakers, in order to get moving.”
The  VMove  concept is simple. Engage in whatever movements you choose, whenever you can, wherever you are. Move for at least a couple of minutes every half hour. In general, more is better, but there are no rules to what the movements are, whether touching your toes, waving your arms overhead, dancing, or doing more conventional workouts such as push-ups. Joshipura calls this “creactivity” (when the activity creatively goes beyond current norms), and hopes that people will frequently break-out into these movements.  The  VMove  website  and  YouTube channel  are aimed to help overcome barriers to moving more, and include videos contributed by people demonstrating spontaneous  VMoves  in classrooms, offices, supermarket lines, railway stations, and at home while watching television. You may attract stares at first, but Joshipura challenges us all to be leaders of change.

How can you get VMoving and inspire others?
Start moving creactively at home:
March in place with high knees while talking on the phone
Dance and do toe taps while preparing food or  doing dishes
Perform lunges, jumping jacks, and pushups during television commercials or move while watching TV
Share  VMove  links with people you hang out with regularly such as classmates and coworkers, so you can all move freely together:
Set timers for regular short activity breaks at work
Inspire an organization or unit to adopt  VMove
Move in fun ways together while continuing class or a meeting
Move in settings where you typically wait for several minutes or more: Doctors’ offices, supermarket checkouts, coffee shop lines,  train stations , restroom lines at a ball game. Instead of sitting or standing still, start with small movements that will not cause much attention:
Calf raises , both feet together and then alternating
Shoulder rolls, in a forward direction and then reverse direction
Torso twists, swinging the arms side to side
If you feel more bold:
Overhead arm reaches or big arm circle
Marching, jogging or hopping in place
Tapping feet side to side (step touches)
Plies or squats
Move freely and have a blast
Joshipura promotes a universal  hand signal/logo  for  VMove  to invite, inspire, and show support of moving creactively across language barriers. The logo may be posted in offices, waiting areas, or classrooms to inspire people to move as feasible, and to encourage acceptance of anyone who chooses to participate.
Visit the  VMove website  for more creactive movement ideas, and to share videos showing how you  VMove.  You can also help activate a move-friendly world by spreading the word about  VMove  on social media, using the hashtag #VMove.
