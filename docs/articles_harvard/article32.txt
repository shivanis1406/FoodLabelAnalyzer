Title: What Should I Eat?

Using Harvard’s  Healthy Eating Plate  as a guide, we recommend eating mostly  vegetables ,  fruit , and  whole grains , healthy fats, and  healthy proteins . We suggest drinking  water  instead of sugary beverages, and we also address common dietary concerns such as  salt and sodium ,  vitamins , and  alcohol . It’s also important to stay active and maintain a  healthy weight .
The main message: Focus on diet quality
The  type of carbohydrate  in the diet is more important than the  amount of carbohydrate  in the diet, because some sources of carbohydrate—like vegetables (other than  potatoes ), fruits, whole grains, and beans—are healthier than others.
The Healthy Eating Plate also advises consumers to avoid  sugary beverages , a major source of calories—usually with little nutritional value—in the American diet.
The Healthy Eating Plate encourages consumers to use  healthy oils , and it does not set a maximum on the percentage of calories people should get each day from healthy sources of fat. In this way, the Healthy Eating Plate recommends the opposite of the low-fat message promoted for decades by the USDA.
The Healthy Eating Plate summarizes the best evidence-based dietary information available today. As nutrition researchers are continually discovering valuable information, The Healthy Eating Plate will be updated to reflect new findings.
