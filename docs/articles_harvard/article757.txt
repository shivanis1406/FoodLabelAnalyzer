Title: Italian Pesto alla Trapanese (Almond, Parsley, Basil and Tomato Sauce)

The typical pesto sauce includes basil, pinenuts, and Parmesan cheese. This unique version features almonds, parsley (in addition to basil), tomatoes, and no cheese. It’s great on whole wheat pasta. The additional umami from the tomatoes pairs well with the heartier flavor of whole wheat pasta.
