Title: The Healthy Eating Plate, now in Greek

The Healthy Eating Plate is now available in  Greek ,  providing another example of how to create a Mediterranean diet. There isn’t one specific Mediterranean diet, as there are multiple countries that border the Mediterranean Sea — each with its own foods, eating patterns, and lifestyles — but there are some similarities that help define a Mediterranean eating pattern.  As described by a 2013 study (1), the traditional Mediterranean diet includes:
• High intake of olive oil (preferably extra virgin), nuts, vegetables, fruits & cereals 
• Moderate intake of fish and poultry 
• Low intake of dairy products, red meat, processed meats, and sweets 
• Wine in moderation, consumed with meals
There may not be one “perfect” diet for everyone, but  research  shows that the Mediterranean diet can be a good model upon which to base your own dietary strategy as long as it incorporates healthy, high-quality foods. Besides the new  Greek  translation, The Healthy Eating Plate is also available in  Bosnian ,  Croatian , and  Spanish , providing even more great examples of what a Mediterranean Diet can look like.
