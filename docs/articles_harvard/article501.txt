Title: Food Features

Did you know that references to  yogurt  and health date all the way back to 6000 BCE? Or that before its dramatic rise in popularity,  kale  was more often used as a garnish?
What makes food so enjoyable—beyond the flavors, textures, and variety it brings to everyday life—is that each one has some unique story behind it; from where it was first cultivated, to how it’s been used and adapted for changing tastes and preferences from one decade to the next. Of course, there’s also the relationship between food and health, though we know it’s more important to focus on an  overall healthy eating pattern , rather than a few magic-bullet “ superfoods .”
Indeed, these food features aren’t about promoting any individual foods, but an opportunity to explore a bit of the history and research behind them, along with some practical tips for when you’re shopping and cooking. Take a look!
