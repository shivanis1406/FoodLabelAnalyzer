Title: Oatmeal and Onion Roti

Oatmeal and Onion Roti
3 cups oatmeal, lightly crushed
4 ¼ cups whole-wheat flour
2 teaspoons carom seeds
1½ teaspoons salt
¼ cup chopped green coriander (cilantro)
¼ cup chopped onions
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 teaspoon turmeric powder
13 ounces water
Mix all the ingredients together and knead to make a medium-soft dough. Cover dough with a wet cloth and let it sit for 10 minutes.
Divide the dough into 17 equal balls and flatten each ball into a 6-inch disk.
Place each disk on a griddle heated to medium heat for one minute, and flip over to cook on the other side for another minute. Keep flipping until brown spots appear on bread.
