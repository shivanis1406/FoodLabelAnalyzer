Title: Wild Rice with Cranberries and Cider

Wild Rice with Cranberries and Cider
½ cup brown rice
½ cup wild rice
1 cup apple cider
1 ¼ cups water
½ cup dried cranberries, reconstituted in warm water
1 shallot, sliced thin
1 teaspoon olive oil
Salt (optional) and pepper to taste
Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
Toss the sliced shallots with olive oil and a dash of salt if desired, place in a baking dish, and roast until just brown and tender, about 10 minutes. Remove them from the oven and set aside.
Place the wild rice, brown rice, cider, and water in a deep pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for one minute, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until all of the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat.
Add the cranberries and shallots to the rice mixture and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve.
