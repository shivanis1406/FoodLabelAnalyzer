Title: Healthy Eating Plate vs. USDA’s MyPlate

The  Healthy Eating Plate , created by experts at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, points consumers to the healthiest choices in the major food groups. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA)  MyPlate , though it has been revised to reflect some key findings, still doesn’t offer the most complete picture when it comes to basic nutrition advice.
The Healthy Eating Plate is based exclusively on the best available science and was not subjected to political or commercial pressures from food industry lobbyists. Here’s a table showing how the Healthy Eating Plate compares to the USDA’s MyPlate, section by section.
