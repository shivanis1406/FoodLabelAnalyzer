Title: Braised Cabbage with Leeks and Sesame Seeds

Cabbage is often overlooked in the produce section, but it is a great alternative to more common leafy greens. Sesame seeds and oil give the cabbage a rich, nutty flavor.
Braised Cabbage with Leeks and Sesame Seeds
1 quarter head of green cabbage, shredded
2 leeks, sliced, white parts only, well cleaned
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
Salt and pepper to taste
Warm olive oil in a deep sauté pan. Once warm, add leeks and sprinkle with salt. Sauté until tender.
Add the cabbage, stirring well to combine. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of water; cover and cook on medium to low heat until the cabbage is tender. Season with salt and pepper.
Drizzle with sesame oil, tossing gently to coat. Remove from heat to a warm serving platter and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
