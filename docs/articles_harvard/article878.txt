Title: Forbidden Rice with Scallions

Forbidden Rice with Scallions
2 cups vegetable broth
2 tablespoons apple cider
½ cup “Forbidden” black rice (available in specialty supermarkets)
½ cup brown rice
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 tablespoons shallots, minced
¼ cup scallions, sliced
In a medium saucepan, bring the vegetable broth and apple cider to a boil. Add the brown rice and the black rice, stir, and return to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the liquid has been absorbed, about 25 minutes.
Halfway through the cooking process, heat the oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and cook until shallots are translucent and soft, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside until rice is finished.
Fold shallots into the rice, and add salt (if desired) and pepper to taste. Top with scallions and serve warm.
