Title: Roasted Beets with Balsamic Vinegar

Roasted Beets with Balsamic Vinegar
4 medium beets, washed, peeled, and diced into roughly 1-inch pieces
1 tablespoon canola oil
Salt (optional) and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh parsley
Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
Toss the beets with oil, salt (if desired), and pepper to coat evenly.
Place the beets in a baking dish and roast for 25 to 30 minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork.
Remove the beets from the oven, add vinegar, and mix right away with a spatula, scraping any caramelized bits off the bottom of the dish.
Transfer beets to a serving dish, garnish with fresh parsley, and serve.
