Title: Bulgur Pilaf

Bulgur Pilaf
1¼ cups low-sodium vegetable broth, heated
1 cup bulgur
1½ tablespoons olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
½ cup tomatoes, chopped
½ cup sun dried tomatoes, minced
1 dash crushed red pepper (or to taste)
2 teaspoons lemon juice
2 teaspoons honey
2 teaspoons canola oil
Salt (optional) and pepper to taste
Heat the oil in a sauté pan over medium heat, and sauté the garlic until it is tender; do not let it get brown.
Add the bulgur and sauté until it smells toasty, about 10 minutes. Pour in the hot broth, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until all the broth has been absorbed, about 10 minutes.
Fluff bulgur with a fork. Gently stir in diced and dried tomatoes.
In a small bowl, whisk together lemon juice, honey, canola oil, crushed red pepper, salt (if desired), and pepper. Pour over bulgur and blend well. Serve warm.
