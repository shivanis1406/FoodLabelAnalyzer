Title: Healthy Living Guide 2023/2024


A Digest on Healthy Eating and Healthy Living
“The apple in your hand is the body of the cosmos.” – Thich Nhat Hanh
Happy New Year, and welcome to the fourth edition of the  Healthy Living Guide ! 2023 was an exciting year in the Department of Nutrition, as we celebrated the launch of the  Thich Nhat Hanh Center for Mindfulness in Public Health . Aligned with its name and location, the Center is committed to researching ways to apply mindfulness to improve well-being at the population level—not just for individuals, but across large groups globally. Mindful eating and its impact on both personal and planetary health is a core focus of the Center—a theme you’ll find integrated throughout this year’s  Guide .
You’ll also see research highlights and tips related to our annual categories of nutrition, physical activity, and sleep, including the latest findings on ultra-processed foods and mental health, turning up the tunes and moving with Zumba, and evidence on different sleep “chronotypes” and health.
Wishing you a healthy, fulfilling, and mindful 2024.
